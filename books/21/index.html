</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-413" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Preface</span></span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-22" class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Purpose</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">This book advances a framework, a process, and compositional approaches for designing a proposal or research project for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research in the human, health, and social sciences. The ascendency of qualitative research, the emergence of mixed methods approaches, and the growth of quantitative designs have created a need for this book’s unique comparison of the three approaches to inquiry. This comparison begins with preliminary consideration of philosophical assumptions for all three approaches, a review of the literature, an assessment of the use of theory and conceptual frameworks in research approaches, and reflections about the importance of writing and ethics in scholarly inquiry. The book then addresses the key elements in the process of designing and conducting a research project: writing an introduction; stating a purpose or research aims for the study; identifying research questions and hypotheses; and advancing methods and procedures for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. At each step in this process, the reader is taken through qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Audience</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">This book is intended for students and faculty who seek assistance in preparing a plan, proposal, or research project for a scholarly journal article, a dissertation, a thesis, or an application for funding. At a broader level, the book may be useful as both a reference book and a textbook for courses in research methods. To best take advantage of the design features in this book, the reader needs a basic familiarity with qualitative and quantitative research; however, terms will be explained and defined and recommended strategies advanced for those needing introductory assistance in the design process. Highlighted terms in the text and a glossary of the terms at the back of the book provide a working language for understanding research. This book also is intended for a broad audience in the human, health, and social sciences. Readers’ comments from the past four editions suggest that individuals using the book come from many disciplines and fields. We hope that researchers in fields such as marketing, management, criminal justice, communication studies, psychology, sociology, K&ndash;12 education, higher and postsecondary education, nursing, family medicine, health services research, global health, behavioral health, urban studies, family research, and other fields of study will find this fifth edition useful.</p><p id="calibre_link-24" class="calibre_1">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Format</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In each chapter, we share examples drawn from varied disciplines. These examples are drawn from books, journal articles, dissertation proposals, and dissertations. Though our primary specialization is in educational psychology, the health sciences, and in psychology, the illustrations are intended to be inclusive of many fields. They reflect issues in social justice and examples of studies with marginalized individuals in our society as well as the traditional samples and populations studied by researchers. Inclusiveness also extends to methodological pluralism in research today, and the discussion incorporates alternative philosophical ideas, diverse modes of inquiry, and numerous procedures.</p><p class="calibre_">This book is not a detailed method text; instead, we highlight the essential features of research design. We have attempted to reduce research to its essential core ideas so that researchers can plan a thorough and thoughtful study. The coverage of research designs is limited to frequently used forms: surveys and experiments in quantitative research; narrative research, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case studies in qualitative research; and convergent, explanatory sequential, and exploratory sequential designs in mixed methods research. Although students preparing a dissertation proposal should find this book helpful, topics related to the politics of presenting and negotiating a study with review committees are addressed thoroughly in other texts.</p><p class="calibre_">Consistent with accepted conventions of scholarly writing, we have tried to eliminate any words or examples that convey a discriminatory (e.g., sexist or ethnic) orientation. Examples were selected to provide a full range of gender and cultural orientations. Throughout the text we do not favor either qualitative or quantitative research. Indeed, we have intentionally altered the order of qualitative and quantitative examples throughout the book. Readers should also note that in the longer examples cited in this book, many references are made to other writings. Only the reference to the work we use in the illustration will be cited, not the entire list of references embedded within any particular example. As with earlier editions, we have maintained features to enhance the readability and understandability of the material: bullets to emphasize key points, numbered points to stress key steps in a process, and longer examples of complete passages with annotations to highlight key research ideas that are being conveyed by the authors.</p><p class="calibre_">In this fifth edition of the book, new features have been added in response to developments in research and reader feedback:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">In this edition, we shape the discussion not only around designing a <span class="italic">proposal</span> for a <span class="italic">research project</span> but also around the steps in designing a <span class="italic">research study</span>.

Preliminary Considerations</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">This part of the book discusses preparing for the design of a scholarly study. It contains <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapters 1</a> through <a href="#calibre_link-10">4</a>.</p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter 1. The Selection of a Research Approach</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In this chapter, we begin by defining quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches. We then discuss how philosophy, designs, and methods intersect when one uses one of these approaches. We review different philosophical stances; advanced types of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods designs; and then discuss the methods associated with each design. We also consider the factors that go into the choice of an approach to research. Thus, this chapter should help proposal developers decide whether a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods approach is suitable for their proposed research project.</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter 2. Review of the Literature</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">It is important to extensively review the literature on your topic before you design your proposal. Thus, you need to begin with a researchable topic and then explore the literature using the steps advanced in this chapter. This calls for setting a priority for selecting material from the literature, drawing a visual map of studies that relate to your topic, writing good abstracts, employing skills learned from using style manuals, and defining key terms. This chapter should help researchers thoughtfully consider relevant literature on their topics and start compiling and writing literature reviews.</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter 3. The Use of Theory</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Theories serve different purposes in the three approaches inquiry. In quantitative research, they provide a proposed explanation for the relationship among variables being tested by the investigator. In qualitative research, they may often serve as a lens for the inquiry or they may be generated during the study. In mixed methods studies, researchers employ them in many ways, including those associated with quantitative and qualitative approaches. This chapter helps researchers consider and plan how theory might be incorporated into their studies.</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter 4. Writing Strategies and Ethical Considerations</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">It is helpful to have an overall outline of the topics to be included in a proposal or research study before you begin writing. Thus, this chapter begins with different outlines for writing proposals. The outlines can be used as models depending on whether your proposed study is qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods. Then we convey several ideas about the actual writing of the proposal, such as developing a habit of writing, and grammar ideas that have been helpful to us in improving our scholarly writing. Finally, we turn to ethical issues and discuss these not as abstract ideas, but as considerations that need to be anticipated in multiple phases of the research process.</p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Part II. Designing Research</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In <a href="#calibre_link-11">Part II</a>, we turn to the components of designing the research proposal. <a href="#calibre_link-12">Chapters 5</a> through <a href="#calibre_link-17">10</a> address steps in this process.</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter 5. The Introduction</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">It is important to properly introduce a research study. We provide a model for writing a good scholarly introduction to your proposal. The chapter begins with designing an abstract for a study. This is followed by developing an introduction to include identifying the research problem or issue, framing this problem within the existing literature, pointing out deficiencies in the literature, and targeting the study for an audience. This chapter provides a systematic method for designing a scholarly introduction to a proposal or study.</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter 6. The Purpose Statement</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">At the beginning of research proposals or projects, authors mention the central purpose or intent of the study. This passage is the most important statement in the entire research process, and an entire chapter is devoted to this topic. In this chapter, you learn how to write this statement for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies, and you will be provided with scripts that help you design and write these statements.</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter 7. Research Questions and Hypotheses</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">The questions and hypotheses addressed by the researcher serve to narrow and focus the purpose of the study. As a major signpost in a project, the set of research questions and hypotheses needs to be written carefully. In this chapter, you will learn how to write both qualitative and quantitative research questions and hypotheses, as well as how to employ both forms in writing mixed methods questions and hypotheses. Numerous examples serve as scripts to illustrate these processes.</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter 8. Quantitative Methods</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Quantitative methods involve the processes of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and writing the results of a study. Specific methods exist in both survey and experimental research that relate to identifying a sample and population, specifying the type of design, collecting and analyzing data, presenting the results, making an interpretation, and writing the research in a manner consistent with a survey or experimental study. In this chapter, the reader learns the specific procedures for designing survey or experimental methods that need to go into a research proposal. Checklists provided in the chapter help to ensure that all steps are included.</p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter 9. Qualitative Methods</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Qualitative approaches to data collection, analysis, interpretation, and report writing differ from the traditional, quantitative approaches. Purposeful sampling, collection of open-ended data, analysis of text or images (e.g., pictures), representation of information in figures and tables, and personal interpretation of the findings all inform qualitative methods. This chapter advances steps in designing qualitative procedures into a research proposal, and it also includes a checklist for making sure that you cover important procedures. Ample illustrations provide examples from narrative studies, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case studies.</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter 10. Mixed Methods Procedures</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Mixed methods involves the collection and “mixing” or integration of both quantitative and qualitative data in a study. It is not enough to only analyze your qualitative and quantitative data. Further analysis consists of integrating the two databases for additional insight into research problems and questions. Mixed methods research has increased in popularity in recent years, and this chapter highlights important developments and provides an introduction to the use of this design. This chapter begins by defining mixed methods research and the core characteristics that describe it. Then the three core designs in mixed methods research&mdash;(a) convergent, (b) explanatory sequential, and (c) exploratory sequential&mdash;are detailed in terms of their characteristics, data collection and analysis features, and approaches for interpreting and validating the research. Further, these core designs are employed within other designs (e.g., experiments), within theories (e.g., feminist research), and within methodologies (e.g., evaluation procedures). Finally, we discuss the decisions needed to determine which one of the designs would be best for your mixed methods project. We provide examples of the core designs and include a checklist to review to determine whether you incorporated all of the essential steps in your proposal or project.</p><p class="calibre_">Designing a study is a difficult and time-consuming process. This book will not necessarily make the process easier or faster, but it can provide specific skills useful in research, knowledge about the steps involved in the process, and a practical guide to composing and writing scholarly research. Before the steps of the process unfold, we recommend that proposal developers think through their approaches to research, conduct literature reviews on their topics, develop an outline of topics to include in a proposal design, and begin anticipating potential ethical issues that may arise in the research. <a href="#calibre_link-6">Part I</a> begins with these topics.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-3" class="calibre_1">

Specific former students and editors were instrumental in its development: Dr. Sharon Hudson, Dr. Leon Cantrell, the late Nette Nelson, Dr. De Tonack, Dr. Ray Ostrander, and Diane Wells. Since the publication of the first edition, John has also become indebted to the students in his introductory research methods courses and to individuals who have participated in his qualitative and mixed methods seminars. These courses have been his laboratories for working out ideas, incorporating new ones, and sharing his experiences as a writer and researcher. In addition, John wants to thank his staff over the years in the Office of Qualitative and Mixed Methods Research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who have helped to conceptualize content in this book and now those in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Michigan. John is especially indebted to the scholarly work of Dr. Vicki Plano Clark, Dr. Ron Shope, Dr. Kim Galt, Dr. Yun Lu, Dr. Sherry Wang, Amanda Garrett, and Dr. Alex Morales.</p><p class="calibre_">In addition, we are grateful for the insightful suggestions provided by the reviewers for SAGE. We also could not have produced this book without the generous support and encouragement of our friends at SAGE. SAGE is and has been a first-rate publishing house. We especially owe much to our former editor and mentor, C. Deborah Laughton (now of Guilford Press), and to Lisa Cuevas-Shaw and Vicki Knight. Now we are working under the talented guidance of Helen Salmon, who has been most supportive of our work and who has encouraged us throughout the process. Lastly, we want to thank all of the SAGE staff with whom we have had the pleasure to work. We have grown together and helped to develop research methods as a distinguished, worldwide field.

These considerations relate to selecting an appropriate research approach, reviewing the literature to position the proposed study within the existing literature, deciding on whether to use a theory in the study, and employing&mdash;at the outset&mdash;good writing and ethical practices.<a></a></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-7" class="calibre_1">

</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_25">Chapter 1</span></span></span><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"> The Selection of a Research Approach</span></span></p><p class="calibre_3"><span class="bold">Research approaches</span> are plans and the procedures for research that span the steps from broad assumptions to detailed methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation. This plan involves several decisions, and they need not be taken in the order in which they make sense to us and the order of their presentation here. The overall decision involves which approach should be used to study a topic. Informing this decision should be the philosophical assumptions the researcher brings to the study; procedures of inquiry (called <span class="bold">research designs</span>); and specific <span class="bold">research methods</span> of data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The selection of a research approach is also based on the nature of the <span class="bold">research problem</span> or issue being addressed, the researchers’ personal experiences, and the audiences for the study. Thus, in this book, <span class="italic">research approaches, research designs,</span> and <span class="italic">research methods</span> are three key terms that represent a perspective about research that presents information in a successive way from broad constructions of research to the narrow procedures of methods.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-26" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">The Three Approaches to Research</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In this book, three research approaches are advanced: (a) qualitative, (b) quantitative, and (c) mixed methods. Unquestionably, the three approaches are not as discrete as they first appear. Qualitative and <a id="calibre_link-399"></a>quantitative approaches should not be viewed as rigid, distinct categories, polar opposites, or dichotomies. Instead, they represent different ends on a continuum (Creswell, 2015; Newman &amp; Benz, 1998). A study <span class="italic">tends</span> to be more qualitative than quantitative or vice versa. <span class="bold">Mixed methods research</span> resides in the middle of this continuum because it incorporates elements of both qualitative and quantitative approaches.</p><p class="calibre_">Often the distinction between <span class="bold">qualitative research</span> and <span class="bold">quantitative research</span> is framed in terms of using words (qualitative) rather than numbers (quantitative), or better yet, using closed-ended questions and responses (quantitative hypotheses) or open-ended questions and responses (qualitative interview questions). A more complete way to view the gradations of differences between them is in the basic philosophical assumptions researchers bring to the study, the types of research strategies used in the research (e.g., quantitative experiments or qualitative <span class="bold">case studies</span>), and the specific methods employed in conducting these strategies (e.g., collecting data quantitatively on instruments versus collecting qualitative data through observing a setting). Moreover, there is a historical evolution to both approaches&mdash;with the quantitative approaches dominating the forms of research in the social sciences from the late 19th century up until the mid-20th century. During the latter half of the 20th century, interest in qualitative research increased and along with it, the development of mixed methods research. With this background, it should prove helpful to view definitions of these three key terms as used in this book:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Qualitative research</span> is an approach for exploring and understanding the meaning individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem. The process of research involves emerging questions and procedures, data typically collected in the participant’s setting, data analysis inductively building from particulars to general themes, and the researcher making interpretations of the meaning of the data. The final written report has a flexible structure. Those who engage in this form of inquiry support a way of looking at research that honors an inductive style, a focus on individual meaning, and the importance of reporting the complexity of a situation.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Quantitative research</span> is an approach for testing objective <span class="bold">theories</span> by examining the relationship among variables. These variables, in turn, can be measured, typically on instruments, so that numbered data can be analyzed using statistical procedures. The final written report has a set structure consisting of introduction, literature and theory, methods, results, and discussion. Like qualitative researchers, those who engage in this form of inquiry have assumptions about testing theories deductively, building in protections against bias, controlling for alternative or counterfactual explanations, and being able to generalize and replicate the findings.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Mixed methods research</span> is an approach to inquiry involving collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, integrating the two forms of data, and using distinct designs that may involve philosophical assumptions and theoretical frameworks. The core assumption of this form of inquiry is that the integration of qualitative and quantitative data yields additional insight beyond the information provided by either the quantitative or qualitative data alone.</li></ul><p class="calibre_">These definitions have considerable information in each one of them. Throughout this book, we will discuss the parts of the definitions so that their meanings will become clear to you as you read ahead.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-27" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Three Components Involved in an Approach</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Two important components in each definition are that the approach to research involves philosophical assumptions as well as distinct methods or procedures. The broad research approach is the <span class="italic">plan or proposal to conduct research</span>, involves the intersection of philosophy, research designs, and specific methods. A framework that we use to explain the interaction of these three components is seen in <a href="#calibre_link-215">Figure 1.1</a>. To reiterate, in planning a study, researchers need to think through the philosophical <span class="bold">worldview</span> assumptions that they bring to the study, the research design that is related to this worldview, and the specific methods or procedures of research that translate the approach into practice.</p><p id="calibre_link-215" class="calibre_1"></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 1.1</span> A Framework for Research&mdash;The Interconnection of Worldviews, Design, and Research Methods</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000003.jpg" class="calibre_27" /></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-28" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Philosophical Worldviews</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Although philosophical ideas remain largely hidden in research (Slife &amp; Williams, 1995), they still influence the practice of research and need to be identified. We suggest that individuals preparing a research proposal or plan make explicit the larger philosophical ideas they espouse. This information will help explain why they chose qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods approaches for their research. In writing about worldviews, a proposal might include a section that addresses the following:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">The philosophical worldview proposed in the study</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">A definition of basic ideas of that worldview</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">How the worldview shaped their approach to research</li></ul><p class="calibre_">We have chosen to use the term <span class="italic">worldview</span> as meaning “a basic set of beliefs that guide action” (Guba, 1990, p. 17). Others have called them <span class="italic">paradigms</span> (Lincoln, Lynham, &amp; Guba, 2011; Mertens, 2010); <span class="italic">epistemologies</span> and <span class="italic">ontologies</span> (Crotty, 1998), or <span class="italic">broadly conceived research methodologies</span> (Neuman, 2009). We see worldviews as a general philosophical orientation about the world and the nature of research that a researcher brings to a study. Individuals develop worldviews based on their discipline orientations and <a id="calibre_link-287"></a>research communities, advisors and mentors, and past research experiences. The types of beliefs held by individual researchers based on these factors will often lead to embracing a strong qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods approach in their research. Although there is ongoing debate about what worldviews or beliefs researchers bring to inquiry, we will highlight four that are widely discussed in the literature: postpositivism, constructivism, transformative, and <span class="bold">pragmatism.</span> The major elements of each position are presented in <a href="#calibre_link-216">Table 1.1</a>.</p><p id="calibre_link-29" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Postpositivist Worldview</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">The postpositivist assumptions have represented the traditional form of research, and these assumptions hold true more for quantitative research than qualitative research. This worldview is sometimes called the <span class="italic">scientific method,</span> or doing <span class="italic">science research</span>. It is also called <span class="italic">positivist/postpositivist research, empirical science</span>, and <span class="italic">postpositivism</span>. This last term is called postpositivism because it represents the thinking after positivism, challenging the traditional notion of the absolute truth of knowledge (Phillips &amp; Burbules, 2000) and recognizing that we cannot be absolutely positive about our claims of knowledge when studying the behavior and actions of humans. The postpositivist tradition comes from 19th-century writers, such as Comte, Mill, Durkheim, Newton, and Locke (Smith, 1983) and more recently from writers such as Phillips and Burbules (2000).</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Postpositivists</span> hold a deterministic philosophy in which causes (probably) determine effects or outcomes. Thus, the problems studied by postpositivists reflect the need to identify and assess the causes that influence outcomes, such as those found in experiments. It is also reductionistic in that the intent is to reduce the ideas into a small, discrete set to test, such as the variables that comprise hypotheses and research questions. The knowledge that develops through a postpositivist lens is based on careful observation and measurement of the objective reality that exists “out there” in the world. Thus, developing numeric measures of observations and studying the behavior of individuals becomes paramount for a postpositivist. Finally, there are laws or theories that govern the world, and these need to be tested or verified and refined so that we can understand the world. Thus, in the scientific method&mdash;the accepted approach to research by postpositivists&mdash;a researcher begins with a theory, collects data that either supports or refutes the theory, and then makes necessary revisions and conducts additional tests.</p><blockquote class="calibre_28"><img src="images/000025.jpg" id="calibre_link-216" class="calibre_29" />
</blockquote><p id="calibre_link-275" class="calibre_">In reading Phillips and Burbules (2000), you can gain a sense of the key assumptions of this position, such as the following:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Knowledge is conjectural (and antifoundational)&mdash;absolute truth can never be found. Thus, evidence established in research is always imperfect and fallible. It is for this reason that researchers state that they do not prove a hypothesis; instead, they indicate a failure to reject the hypothesis.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Research is the process of making claims and then refining or abandoning some of them for other claims more strongly warranted.

Constructivism or social constructivism (often combined with interpretivism) is such a perspective, and it is typically seen as an approach to qualitative research. The ideas came from Mannheim and from works such as Berger and Luckmann’s (1967) <span class="italic">The Social Construction of Reality</span> and Lincoln and Guba’s (1985) <span class="italic">Naturalistic Inquiry</span>. More recent writers who have summarized this position are Lincoln and colleagues (2011), Mertens (2010), and Crotty (1998), among others. <span class="bold">Social constructivists</span> believe that individuals seek understanding of the <a id="calibre_link-321"></a>world in which they live and work. Individuals develop subjective meanings of their experiences&mdash;meanings directed toward certain objects or things. These meanings are varied and multiple, leading the researcher to look for the complexity of views rather than narrowing meanings into a few categories or ideas. The goal of the research is to rely as much as possible on the participants’ views of the situation being studied. The questions become broad and general so that the participants can construct the meaning of a situation, typically forged in discussions or interactions with other persons. The more open-ended the questioning, the better, as the researcher listens carefully to what people say or do in their life settings. Often these subjective meanings are negotiated socially and historically. They are not simply imprinted on individuals but are formed through interaction with others (hence social constructivism) and through historical and cultural norms that operate in individuals’ lives. Thus, constructivist researchers often address the processes of interaction among individuals. They also focus on the specific contexts in which people live and work in order to understand the historical and cultural settings of the participants. Researchers recognize that their own backgrounds shape their interpretation, and they position themselves in the research to acknowledge how their interpretation flows from their personal, cultural, and historical experiences. The researcher’s intent is to make sense of (or interpret) the meanings others have about the world. Rather than starting with a theory (as in postpositivism), inquirers generate or inductively develop a theory or pattern of meaning.</p><p class="calibre_">For example, in discussing constructivism, Crotty (1998) identified several assumptions:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Human beings construct meanings as they engage with the world they are interpreting. Qualitative researchers tend to use open-ended questions so that the participants can share their views.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Humans engage with their world and make sense of it based on their historical and social perspectives&mdash;we are all born into a world of meaning bestowed upon us by our culture. Thus, qualitative researchers seek to understand the context or setting of the participants through visiting this context and gathering information personally. They also interpret what they find, an interpretation shaped by the researcher’s own experiences and background.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">The basic generation of meaning is always social, arising in and out of interaction with a human community. The process of qualitative research is largely inductive; the inquirer generates meaning from the data collected in the field.</li></ol><p id="calibre_link-31" class="calibre_20">
</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Transformative Worldview</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Another group of researchers holds to the philosophical assumptions of the transformative approach. This position arose during the 1980s and 1990s from individuals who felt that the postpositivist assumptions imposed structural laws and theories that did not fit marginalized individuals in our society or issues of power and social justice, discrimination, and oppression that needed to be addressed. There is no uniform body of literature characterizing this worldview, but it includes groups of researchers that are critical theorists; participatory action researchers; Marxists; feminists; racial and ethnic minorities; persons with disabilities; indigenous and postcolonial peoples; and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and queer communities. Historically, the transformative writers have drawn on the works of Marx, Adorno, Marcuse, Habermas, and Freire (Neuman, 2009). Fay (1987), Heron and Reason (1997), Kemmis and Wilkinson (1998), Kemmis and McTaggart (2000), and Mertens (2009, 2010) are additional writers to read for this perspective.</p><p class="calibre_">In the main, these inquirers felt that the constructivist stance did not go far enough in advocating for an action agenda to help marginalized peoples. A <span class="bold">transformative worldview</span> holds that research inquiry needs to be intertwined with politics and a political change agenda to confront social oppression at whatever levels it occurs (Mertens, 2010). Thus, the research contains an action agenda for reform that may change lives of the participants, the institutions in which individuals work or live, and the researcher’s life. Moreover, specific issues need to be addressed that speak to important social issues of the day, issues such as empowerment, inequality, oppression, domination, suppression, and alienation. The researcher often begins with one of these issues as the focal point of the study. This research also assumes that the inquirer will proceed collaboratively so as to not further marginalize the participants as a result of the inquiry. In this sense, the participants may help design questions, collect data, analyze information, or reap the rewards of the research. Transformative research provides a voice for these participants, raising their consciousness or advancing an agenda for change to improve their lives. It becomes a united voice for reform and change.</p><p class="calibre_">This philosophical worldview focuses on the needs of groups and individuals in our society that may be marginalized or disenfranchised. Therefore, theoretical perspectives may be integrated with the philosophical assumptions that construct a picture of the issues being examined, the people to be studied, and the changes that are needed, such as feminist perspectives, racialized discourses, critical theory, queer theory, and disability theory&mdash;theoretical lens to be discussed more in <a href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter 3</a>.</p><p class="calibre_">Although these are diverse groups and our explanations here are generalizations, it is helpful to view the summary by Mertens (2010) of key features of the transformative worldview or paradigm:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">It places central importance on the study of lives and experiences of diverse groups that have traditionally been marginalized. Of special interest for these diverse groups is how their lives have been constrained by oppressors and the strategies that they use to resist, challenge, and subvert these constraints.</li><a id="calibre_link-295"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16">In studying these diverse groups, the research focuses on inequities based on gender, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic class that result in asymmetric power relationships.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">The research in the transformative worldview links political and social action to these inequities.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Transformative research uses a program theory of beliefs about how a program works and why the problems of oppression, domination, and power relationships exist.</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-32" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Pragmatic Worldview</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Another position about worldviews comes from the pragmatists. Pragmatism derives from the work of Peirce, James, Mead, and Dewey (Cherryholmes, 1992). Other writers include Murphy (1990), Patton (1990), and Rorty (1990). There are many forms of this philosophy, but for many, pragmatism as a worldview arises out of actions, situations, and consequences rather than antecedent conditions (as in postpositivism). There is a concern with applications&mdash;what works&mdash;and solutions to problems (Patton, 1990). Instead of focusing on methods, researchers emphasize the research problem and question and use all approaches available to understand the problem (see Rossman &amp; Wilson, 1985). As a philosophical underpinning for mixed methods studies, Morgan (2007), Patton (1990), and Tashakkori and Teddlie (2010) convey its importance for focusing attention on the research problem in social science research and then using pluralistic approaches to derive knowledge about the problem. Using Cherryholmes (1992), Morgan (2007), and our own views, pragmatism provides a philosophical basis for research:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Pragmatism is not committed to any one system of philosophy and reality. This applies to mixed methods research in that inquirers draw liberally from both quantitative and qualitative assumptions when they engage in their research.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Individual researchers have a freedom of choice. In this way, researchers are free to choose the methods, techniques, and procedures of research that best meet their needs and purposes.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Pragmatists do not see the world as an absolute unity. In a similar way, mixed methods researchers look to many approaches for collecting and analyzing data rather than subscribing to only one way (e.g., quantitative or qualitative).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Truth is what works at the time. It is not based in a duality between reality independent of the mind or within the mind. Thus, in mixed methods research, investigators use both quantitative and qualitative data because they work to provide the best understanding of a research problem.</li><a id="calibre_link-296"></a><li value="5" class="calibre_16">The pragmatist researchers look to the <span class="italic">what</span> and <span class="italic">how</span> to research based on the intended consequences&mdash;where they want to go with it. Mixed methods researchers need to establish a purpose for their mixing, a rationale for the reasons why quantitative and qualitative data need to be mixed in the first place.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">Pragmatists agree that research always occurs in social, historical, political, and other contexts. In this way, mixed methods studies may include a postmodern turn, a theoretical lens that is reflective of social justice and political aims.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">Pragmatists have believed in an external world independent of the mind as well as that lodged in the mind. But they believe that we need to stop asking questions about reality and the laws of nature (Cherryholmes, 1992). “They would simply like to change the subject” (Rorty, 1990, p. xiv).</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">Thus, for the mixed methods researcher, pragmatism opens the door to multiple methods, different worldviews, and different assumptions, as well as different forms of data collection and analysis.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Research Designs</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">The researcher not only selects a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods study to conduct; the inquirer also decides on a type of study within these three choices. Research designs are types of inquiry within qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches that provide specific direction for procedures in a research study. Others have called them <span class="italic">strategies of inquiry</span> (Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2011). The designs available to the researcher have grown over the years as computer technology has advanced our data analysis and ability to analyze complex models, and as individuals have articulated new procedures for conducting social science research. Select types will be emphasized in the methods of <a href="#calibre_link-15">Chapters 8</a>, <a href="#calibre_link-16">9</a>, and <a href="#calibre_link-17">10</a>&mdash;designs that are frequently used in the social sciences. Here we introduce those that are discussed later and that are cited in examples throughout the book. An overview of these designs is shown in <a href="#calibre_link-217">Table 1.2</a>.</p><p id="calibre_link-34" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Quantitative Designs</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">During the late 19th and throughout the 20th century, strategies of inquiry associated with quantitative research were those that invoked the postpositivist worldview and that originated mainly in psychology. These include <span class="italic">true experiments</span> and the less rigorous experiments called <span class="italic">quasi-experiments</span> (see, an original, early treatise on this, Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1963). An additional experimental design is <span class="italic">applied behavioral analysis or single-subject experiments</span> in which an experimental treatment is administered over time to a single individual or a small number of individuals (Cooper, Heron, &amp; Heward, 2007; Neuman &amp; McCormick, 1995). One type of nonexperimental quantitative research is <span class="italic">causal-comparative research</span> in which the investigator compares two or more groups in terms of a cause (or independent variable) that has already happened. Another nonexperimental form of research is the <span class="italic">correlational design</span> in which investigators use the correlational statistic to describe and measure the degree or association (or relationship) between two or more variables or sets of scores (Creswell, 2012). These designs have been elaborated into more complex relationships among variables found in techniques of structural equation modeling, hierarchical linear modeling, and logistic regression. More recently, quantitative strategies have involved complex experiments with many variables and treatments (e.g., factorial designs and repeated measure designs). Designs often employ longitudinal data collection over time to examine the development of ideas and trends. Designs have also included elaborate structural equation models that incorporate causal paths and the identification of the collective strength of multiple variables. Rather than discuss all of these quantitative approaches, we will focus on two designs: surveys and experiments.</p><blockquote id="calibre_link-217" class="calibre_28">

Experiments include true experiments, with the random assignment of subjects to treatment conditions, and quasi-experiments that use nonrandomized assignments (Keppel, 1991). Included within quasi-experiments are single-subject designs.</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-35" class="calibre_20">
</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Qualitative Designs</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In qualitative research, the numbers and types of approaches have also become more clearly visible during the 1990s and into the 21st century. The historic origin for qualitative research comes from anthropology, sociology, the humanities, and evaluation. Books have summarized the various types, and complete procedures are now available on specific qualitative inquiry approaches (Creswell &amp; Poth, 2018). For example, Clandinin and Connelly (2000) constructed a picture of what narrative researchers do. Moustakas (1994) discussed the philosophical tenets and the procedures of the phenomenological method; Charmaz (2006), Corbin and Strauss (2007; 2015), and Strauss and Corbin (1990, 1998) identified the procedures of <span class="bold">grounded theory.</span> Fetterman (2010) and Wolcott (2008) summarized ethnographic procedures and the many faces and research strategies of <span class="bold">ethnography,</span> and Stake (1995) and Yin (2009, 2012, 2014) suggested processes involved in case study research. In this book, illustrations are drawn from the following strategies, recognizing that approaches such as participatory action research (Kemmis &amp; McTaggart, 2000), discourse analysis (Cheek, 2004), and others not mentioned are also viable ways to conduct qualitative studies:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Narrative research</span> is a design of inquiry from the humanities in which the researcher studies the lives of individuals and asks one or more individuals to provide stories about their lives (Riessman, 2008). This information is then often retold or restoried by the researcher into a narrative chronology. Often, in the end, the narrative combines views from the participant’s life with those of the researcher’s life in a collaborative narrative (Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Phenomenological research</span> is a design of inquiry coming from philosophy and psychology in which the researcher describes the lived experiences of individuals about a phenomenon as described by participants. This description culminates in the essence of the experiences for several individuals who have all experienced the phenomenon. This design has strong philosophical underpinnings and typically involves conducting interviews (Giorgi, 2009; Moustakas, 1994).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Grounded theory is a design of inquiry from sociology in which the researcher derives a general, abstract theory of a process, action, or interaction grounded in the views of participants. This process involves using multiple stages of data collection and the refinement and interrelationship of categories of information (Charmaz, 2006; Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2007, 2015).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Ethnography is a design of inquiry coming from anthropology and sociology in which the researcher studies the shared patterns of behaviors, language, and actions of an intact cultural group in a natural setting over a prolonged period of time. Data collection often involves observations and interviews.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Case studies are a design of inquiry found in many fields, especially evaluation, in which the researcher develops an in-depth analysis of a case, often a program, event, activity, process, or one or more individuals. Cases are bounded by time and activity, and researchers collect detailed information using a variety of data collection procedures over a sustained period of time (Stake, 1995; Yin, 2009, 2012, 2014).</li><a id="calibre_link-289"></a></ul><p id="calibre_link-36" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Mixed Methods Designs</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Mixed methods involves combining or integration of qualitative and quantitative research and data in a research study. Qualitative data tends to be open-ended without predetermined responses while quantitative data usually includes closed-ended responses such as found on questionnaires or psychological instruments. The field of mixed methods research, as we know it today, began in the middle to late 1980s. Its origins, however, go back further. In 1959, Campbell and Fisk used multiple methods to study psychological traits&mdash;although their methods were only quantitative measures. Their work prompted others to begin collecting multiple forms of data, such as observations and interviews (qualitative data) with traditional surveys (Sieber, 1973). Early thoughts about the value of multiple methods&mdash;called mixed methods&mdash;resided in the idea that all methods had bias and weaknesses, and the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data neutralized the weaknesses of each form of data. Triangulating data sources&mdash;a means for seeking convergence across qualitative and quantitative methods&mdash;was born (Jick, 1979). By the early 1990s, mixed methods turned toward the systematic <span class="italic">integration</span> of quantitative and qualitative data, and the idea of ways to combine the data through different types of research designs emerged. These types of designs were extensively discussed in a major handbook addressing the field in 2003 and reissued in 2010 (Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2010). Procedures for expanding mixed methods developed such as follows:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Ways to integrate the quantitative and qualitative data, such as one database, could be used to check the accuracy (validity) of the other database.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">One database could help explain the other database, and one database could explore different types of questions than the other database.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">One database could lead to better instruments when instruments are not well-suited for a sample or population.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">One database could build on other databases, and one database could alternate with another database back and forth during a longitudinal study.</li></ul><p class="calibre_">Further, the designs were developed and notation was added to help the reader understand the designs; challenges to working with the designs <a id="calibre_link-304"></a>emerged (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011, 2018). Practical issues are being widely discussed today in terms of examples of “good” mixed methods studies and evaluative criteria, the use of a team to conduct this model of inquiry, and the expansion of mixed methods to other countries and disciplines. Although many designs exist in the mixed methods field, this book will focus on the three primary designs found in the social and health sciences today:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Convergent mixed methods</span> is a form of mixed methods design in which the researcher converges or merges quantitative and qualitative data in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the research problem. In this design, the investigator typically collects both forms of data at roughly the same time and then integrates the information in the interpretation of the overall results. Contradictions or incongruent findings are explained or further probed in this design.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Explanatory sequential mixed methods</span> is one in which the researcher first conducts quantitative research, analyzes the results and then builds on the results to explain them in more detail with qualitative research. It is considered explanatory because the initial quantitative data results are explained further with the qualitative data. It is considered sequential because the initial quantitative phase is followed by the qualitative phase. This type of design is popular in fields with a strong quantitative orientation (hence the project begins with quantitative research), but it presents challenges of identifying the quantitative results to further explore and the unequal sample sizes for each phase of the study.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Exploratory sequential mixed methods</span> is the reverse sequence from the explanatory sequential design. In the exploratory sequential approach the researcher first begins with a qualitative research phase and explores the views of participants. The data are then analyzed, and the information used to build into a second, quantitative phase. The qualitative phase may be used to build an instrument that best fits the sample under study, to identify appropriate instruments to use in the follow-up quantitative phase, to develop an intervention for an experiment, to design an app or website, or to specify variables that need to go into a follow-up quantitative study. Particular challenges to this design reside in focusing in on the appropriate qualitative findings to use and the sample selection for both phases of research.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">These basic or core designs then can be used in more complex mixed methods strategies. The core designs can augment an experiment by, for example, collecting qualitative data after the experiment to help explain the quantitative outcome results. The core designs can be used within a case study framework to deductively document cases or to generate cases for further analysis. These basic designs can inform a theoretical study drawn from social justice or power (see <a href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter 3</a>) as an overarching perspective within a design that contains both quantitative and qualitative data. The core designs can also be used in the different phases of an evaluation procedure that spans from a needs assessment to a test of a program or experimental intervention.</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-37" class="calibre_20">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Research Methods</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">The third major element in the framework is the specific research methods that involve the forms of data collection, analysis, and interpretation that researchers propose for their studies. As shown in <a href="#calibre_link-218">Table 1.3</a>, it is useful to consider the full range of possibilities of data collection and to organize these methods, for example, by their degree of predetermined nature, their use of closed-ended versus open-ended questioning, and their focus on numeric versus nonnumeric data analysis. These methods will be developed further in <a href="#calibre_link-15">Chapters 8</a> through <a href="#calibre_link-17">10</a>.</p><p class="calibre_">Researchers collect data on an instrument or test (e.g., a set of questions about attitudes toward self-esteem) or gather information on a behavioral checklist (e.g., observation of a worker engaged in a complex skill). On the other end of the continuum, collecting data might involve visiting a research site and observing the behavior of individuals without predetermined questions or conducting an interview in which the individual is allowed to talk openly about a topic, largely without the use of specific questions. The choice of methods turns on whether the intent is to specify the type of information to be collected in advance of the study or to allow it to emerge from participants in the project. Also, the type of data analyzed may be numeric information gathered on scales of instruments or text information recording and reporting the voice of the participants. Researchers make interpretations of the statistical results, or they interpret the themes or patterns that emerge from the data. In some forms of research, both quantitative and qualitative data are collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Instrument data may be augmented with open-ended observations, or census data may be followed by in-depth exploratory interviews. In this case of mixing methods, the researcher makes inferences across both the quantitative and qualitative databases.</p><blockquote class="calibre_28"><img src="images/000017.jpg" id="calibre_link-218" class="calibre_31" />

Added to worldview, design, and methods would be the research problem, the personal experiences of the researcher, and the audience(s) for whom the report will be written.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-40" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Research Problem and Questions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">A research problem, more thoroughly discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-12">Chapter 5</a>, is an issue or concern that needs to be addressed (e.g., the issue of racial discrimination). The problem comes from a void in the literature, and conflict in research results in the literature, topics that have been neglected in the literature; a need to lift up the voice of marginalized participants; and “real-life” problems found in the workplace, the home, the community, and so forth.</p><p class="calibre_">Certain types of social research problems call for specific approaches. For example, if the problem calls for (a) the identification of factors that influence an outcome, (b) the utility of an intervention, or (c) understanding the best predictors of outcomes, then a quantitative approach is best. It is also the best approach to use to test a theory or explanation. On the other hand, if a concept or phenomenon needs to be explored and understood because little research has been done on it or because it involves an understudied sample, then it merits a qualitative approach. Qualitative research is especially useful when the researcher does not know the important variables to examine. This type of approach may be needed because the topic is new, the subject has never been addressed with a certain sample or group of people, and existing theories do not apply with the particular sample or group under study (Morse, 1991). A mixed methods design is useful when the quantitative or qualitative approach, each by itself, is inadequate to best understand a research problem and the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative research (and its data) can provide the best understanding. For example, a researcher may want to both generalize the findings to a population as well as develop a detailed view of the meaning of a phenomenon or concept for individuals. In this research, the inquirer first explores generally to learn what variables to study and then studies those variables with a large sample of individuals. Alternatively, researchers may first survey a large number of individuals and then follow up with a few participants to obtain their specific views and their voices about the topic. In these situations, collecting both closed-ended quantitative data and open-ended qualitative data proves advantageous.</p><p id="calibre_link-41" class="calibre_1">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Personal Experiences</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Researchers’ own personal training and experiences also influence their choice of approach. An individual trained in technical, scientific writing, statistics, and computer statistical programs and familiar with quantitative journals in the library would most likely choose the quantitative design. On the other hand, individuals who enjoy writing in a literary way or conducting personal interviews or making up-close observations may gravitate to the qualitative approach. The mixed methods researcher is an individual familiar with both quantitative and qualitative research. This person also has the time and resources to collect and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data.</p><p class="calibre_">Since quantitative studies are the traditional mode of research, carefully worked out procedures and rules exist for them. Researchers may be more comfortable with the highly systematic procedures of quantitative research. Also, for some individuals, it can be uncomfortable to challenge accepted approaches among some faculty by using qualitative and transformative approaches to inquiry. On the other hand, qualitative approaches allow room to be innovative and to work more within researcher-designed frameworks. They allow more creative, literary-style writing, a form that individuals may like to use. For those researchers undertaking social justice or community involvement, a qualitative approach is typically best, although this form of research may also incorporate mixed methods designs.</p><p class="calibre_">For the mixed methods researcher, the project will take extra time because of the need to collect and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data.

This literature review helps to determine whether the topic is worth studying, and it provides insight into ways in which the researcher can limit the scope to a needed area of inquiry.</p><p class="calibre_">This chapter continues the discussion about preliminary considerations before launching into a proposal or project. It begins with a discussion about selecting a topic and writing this topic down so that the researcher can continually reflect on it. At this point, researchers also need to consider whether the topic <span class="italic">can</span> and <span class="italic">should</span> be researched. Then the discussion moves into the actual process of reviewing the literature; addressing the general purpose for using literature in a study; and then turning to principles helpful in designing literature into qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-46" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">The Research Topic</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Before considering what literature to use in a project, first identify a topic to study and reflect on whether it is practical and useful to undertake the study. The topic is the subject or subject matter of a proposed study, such as “faculty teaching,” “organizational creativity,” or “psychological stress.” Describe the topic in a few words or in a short phrase. The topic becomes the central idea to learn about or to explore.</p><p class="calibre_">There are several ways that researchers gain some insight into their topics when they are initially planning their research (our assumption is that the topic is chosen by the researcher and not by an adviser or committee member). One way is to draft a brief working title to the study. We are surprised at how often researchers fail to draft a title early in the development of their projects. In our opinion, the working or draft title becomes a major road sign in research&mdash;a tangible idea that the researcher can keep refocusing on and changing as the project goes on (see Glesne, 2015; Glesne &amp; Peshkin, 1992). It becomes an orienting device. We find that, in our research, this topic grounds us and provides a sign of what we are studying, as well as a sign useful for conveying to others the central notion of the study. When students first provide their research project ideas to us, we often ask them to supply a working title if they do not already have one written down on paper.</p><p class="calibre_">How would this working title be written? Try completing this sentence: “My study is about . . .” A response might be, “My study is about at-risk children in the junior high,” or “My study is about helping college faculty <a id="calibre_link-360"></a>become better researchers.” At this stage in the design, frame the answer to the question so that another scholar might easily grasp the meaning of the project. A common shortcoming of beginning researchers is that they frame their study in complex and erudite language. This perspective may result from reading published articles that have undergone numerous revisions before being set in print. Good, sound research projects begin with straightforward, uncomplicated thoughts that are easy to read and understand. Think about a journal article that you have read recently. If it was easy and quick to read, it was likely written in general language that many readers could easily identify with in a way that was straightforward and simple in overall design and conceptualization. As a project develops it will become more complicated.</p><p class="calibre_">Wilkinson (1991) provided useful advice for creating a title: Be brief and avoid wasting words. Eliminate unnecessary words, such as “An Approach to . . . ,” “A Study of . . . ,” and so forth. Use a single title or a double title. An example of a double title would be “An Ethnography: Understanding a Child’s Perception of War.” In addition to Wilkinson’s thoughts, consider a title no longer than 12 words, eliminate most articles and prepositions, and make sure that it includes the focus or topic of the study.</p><p class="calibre_">Another strategy for topic development is to pose the topic as a brief question. What question needs to be answered in the proposed study? A researcher might ask, “What treatment is best for depression?” “What does it mean to be Arabic in U.S. society today?” “What brings people to tourist sites in the Midwest?” When drafting questions such as these, focus on the key topic in the question as the major signpost for the study. Consider how this question might be expanded later to be more descriptive of your study (see <a href="#calibre_link-13">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="#calibre_link-14">7</a> on the purpose statement and research questions and hypotheses).</p><p class="calibre_">Actively elevating this topic to a research study calls for reflecting on whether the topic can and should be researched. A topic <span class="italic">can</span> be researched if a researcher has participants willing to serve in the study. It also can be researched if the investigator has resources such as collecting data over a sustained period of time and using available computer programs to help in the analysis of data.</p><p class="calibre_">The question of <span class="italic">should</span> is a more complex matter. Several factors might go into this decision. Perhaps the most important are whether the topic adds to the pool of research knowledge in the literature available on the topic, replicates past studies, lifts up the voices of underrepresented groups or individuals, helps address social justice, or transforms the ideas and beliefs of the researcher.</p><p class="calibre_">A first step in any project is to spend considerable time in the library examining the research on a topic (strategies for effectively using the library and library resources appear later in this chapter). This point cannot be overemphasized. Beginning researchers may advance a great study that is complete in every way, such as in the clarity of research questions, the comprehensiveness of data collection, and the sophistication of statistical analysis. But the researcher may garner little support from faculty committees or conference <a id="calibre_link-364"></a>planners because the study does not add anything new to the body of research. Ask, “How does this project contribute to the literature?” Consider how the study might address a topic that has yet to be examined, extend the discussion by incorporating new elements, or replicate (or repeat) a study in new situations or with new participants. Contributing to the literature may also mean how the study adds to an understanding of a theory or extends a theory (see <a href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter 3</a>), or how the study provides a new perspective or “angle” to the existing literature, for example, by</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Studying an unusual location (e.g., rural America)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Examining an unusual group of participants (e.g., refugees)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Taking a perspective that may not be expected and reverses the expectation (e.g., why marriages do work rather than do not work)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Providing novel means of collecting data (e.g., collect sounds)</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Presenting results in unusual ways (e.g., graphs that depict geographical locations)</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">Studying a timely topic (e.g., immigration issues) (Creswell, 2016)</li></ul><p class="calibre_">The issue of <span class="italic">should</span> the topic be studied also relates to whether anyone outside of the researcher’s own immediate institution or area would be interested in the topic. Given a choice between a topic that might be of limited regional interest or one of national interest, we would opt for the latter because it would have wide appeal to a much broader audience. Journal editors, committee members, conference planners, and funding agencies all appreciate research that reaches a broad audience. Finally, the <span class="italic">should</span> issue also relates to the researcher’s personal goals. Consider the time it takes to complete a project, revise it, and disseminate the results. All researchers should consider how the study and its heavy commitment of time will pay off in enhancing career goals, whether these goals relate to doing more research, obtaining a future position, or advancing toward a degree.</p><p class="calibre_">Before proceeding with a proposal or a study, one needs to weigh these factors and ask others for their reaction to a topic under consideration. Seek reactions from colleagues, noted authorities in the field, academic advisers, and faculty committee members. We often have students bring to us a one-page sketch of their proposed project that includes the problem or issue leading to a need for the study, the central research question they plan on asking, the types of data they will collect, and the overall significance of their study.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-47" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">The Literature Review</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Once the researcher identifies a topic that can and should be studied, the search can begin for related literature on the topic. The literature review <a id="calibre_link-268"></a>accomplishes several purposes. It shares with the reader the results of other studies that are closely related to the one being undertaken. It relates a study to the larger, ongoing dialogue in the literature, filling in gaps and extending prior studies (Cooper, 2010; Marshall &amp; Rossman, 2016). It provides a framework for establishing the importance of the study as well as a benchmark for comparing the results with other findings. All or some of these reasons may be the foundation for writing the scholarly literature into a study (see Boote &amp; Beile, 2005, for a more extensive discussion of purposes for compiling a literature review in research). Studies need to add to the body of literature on a topic, and literature sections in proposals are generally shaped from the larger problem to the narrower issue that leads directly into the methods of a study.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-48" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Use of the Literature</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Beyond the question of why literature is used is the additional issue of how it is used in research and proposals. It can assume various forms. Our best advice is to seek the opinion of your adviser or faculty members as to how they would like to see the literature addressed. We generally recommend to our advisees that the literature review in a proposal or project be brief and provide a summary of the major studies on the research problem; it does not need to be fully developed and comprehensive at this point, since faculty may ask for major changes in the study at the proposal meeting. In this model, the literature review is shorter&mdash;say 20 to 30 pages in length&mdash;and tells the reader that the student is aware of the literature on the topic and the latest writings. Another approach is to develop a detailed outline of the topics and potential references that will later be developed into an entire chapter, usually the second, titled “Literature Review,” which might run from 20 to 60 pages or so.</p><p class="calibre_">The literature review in a journal article is an abbreviated form of that found in a dissertation or master’s thesis. It typically is contained in a section called “Related Literature” and follows the introduction to a study. This is the pattern for quantitative research articles in journals. For qualitative research articles, the literature review may be found in a separate section, included in the introduction, or threaded throughout the study. Regardless of the form, another consideration is how the literature might be reviewed, depending on whether a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods approach has been selected.</p><p class="calibre_">In general, the literature review can take several forms. Cooper (2010) discussed four types: literature reviews that (a) integrate what others have done and said, (b) criticize previous scholarly works, (c) build bridges between related topics, and (d) identify the central issues in a field. With the exception of criticizing previous scholarly works, most dissertations and theses serve to integrate the literature, organize it into a series of related topics (often from general topics to narrower ones), and summarize the literature by pointing out the central issues.</p><p id="calibre_link-368" class="calibre_">In <span class="italic">qualitative</span> research, inquirers use the literature in a manner consistent with the assumptions of learning from the participant, not prescribing the questions that need to be answered from the researcher’s standpoint. One of the chief reasons for conducting a qualitative study is that the study is exploratory. This usually means that not much has been written about the topic or the population being studied, and the researcher seeks to listen to participants and build an understanding based on what is heard.</p><p class="calibre_">However, the use of the literature in qualitative research varies considerably. In theoretically oriented studies, such as ethnographies or critical ethnographies, the literature on a cultural concept or a critical theory is introduced early in the report or proposal as an orienting framework. In grounded theory, case studies, and phenomenological studies, literature is less often used to set the stage for the study.</p><p class="calibre_">With an approach grounded in learning from participants and variation by type, there are several models for incorporating the literature review into a qualitative study. We offer three placement locations, and it can be used in any or all of these locations. As shown in <a href="#calibre_link-220">Table 2.1</a>, the researcher might include the literature review in the introduction. In this placement, the literature provides a useful backdrop for the problem or issue that has led to the need for the study, such as who has been writing about it, who has studied it, and who has indicated the importance of studying the issue. This framing of the problem is, of course, contingent on available studies. One can find illustrations of this model in many qualitative studies employing different types of inquiry strategy.</p><blockquote class="calibre_28"><img src="images/000030.jpg" id="calibre_link-220" class="calibre_41" />
</blockquote><p id="calibre_link-378" class="calibre_">A second form is to review the literature in a separate section, a model typically used in quantitative research, often found in journals with a quantitative orientation. In theory-oriented qualitative studies, such as ethnography, critical theory, or with a transformative aim, the inquirer might locate the theory discussion and literature in a separate section, typically toward the beginning of the write-up. Third, the researcher may incorporate the related literature in the final section, where it is used to compare and contrast with the results (or themes or categories) to emerge from the study. This model is especially popular in grounded theory studies, and we recommend it because it uses the literature inductively.</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="italic">Quantitative</span> research, on the other hand, includes a substantial amount of literature at the beginning of a study to provide direction for the research questions or hypotheses. It is also used to introduce a problem or to describe in detail the existing literature in a section titled “Related Literature” or “Review of Literature,” or some other similar phrase. Also, the literature review can introduce a theory&mdash;an explanation for expected relationships (see <a href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter 3</a>)&mdash;describe the theory that will be used, and suggest why it is a useful theory to examine. At the end of a study, the researcher then revisits the literature and makes a comparison between the results with the existing findings in the literature. In this model, the quantitative researcher uses the literature deductively as a framework for the research questions or hypotheses.</p><p class="calibre_">In a <span class="italic">mixed methods</span> study, the researcher uses either a qualitative or a quantitative approach to the literature, depending on the type of strategy being used. In a sequential approach, the literature is presented in each phase in a way consistent with the method being used. For example, if the study begins with a quantitative phase, then the investigator is likely to include a substantial literature review that helps to establish a rationale for the research questions or hypotheses. If the study begins with a qualitative phase, then the literature is substantially less, and the researcher may incorporate it more into the end of the study&mdash;an inductive approach. If the research advances a convergent study with an equal weight and emphasis on both qualitative and quantitative data, then the literature may take either qualitative or quantitative forms. The decision as to which form to use is based on the audience for the study and what they would be most receptive to as well as to the students’ graduate committees and their orientation. To recap, the literature used in a mixed methods project will depend on the strategy and the relative weight given to the qualitative or quantitative research in the study.</p><p class="calibre_">Our suggestions for using the literature in planning a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods study are as follows:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">In a qualitative study, use the literature sparingly in the beginning in order to convey an inductive design unless the design type requires a substantial literature orientation at the outset.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Consider the most appropriate place for the literature in a qualitative study, and base the decision on the audience for the project.

Often these are research studies (since you are conducting a research study), but they may also include conceptual articles or opinion pieces that provide frameworks for thinking about topics. There is no single way to conduct a literature review, but many scholars proceed in a systematic fashion to capture, evaluate, and summarize the literature. Here is the way we recommend:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Begin by identifying key words, which is useful in locating materials in an academic library at a college or university. These key words may emerge in identifying a topic or may result from preliminary readings.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">With these key words in mind, use your home computer to begin searching the databases for holdings (i.e., journals and books). Most major libraries have computerized databases, and we suggest you focus initially on journals and books related to the topic. General databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, EBSCO, ProQuest, and JSTOR, cover a broad range of disciplines. Other databases, such as ERIC, Sociofile, or PsycINFO, are based on particular disciplines.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Initially, try to locate about 50 reports of research in articles or books related to research on your topic. Set a priority on the search for journal articles and books because they are easy to locate and obtain. Determine whether these articles and books exist in your academic library or whether you need to send for them by interlibrary loan or purchase them through a bookstore.</li><a id="calibre_link-249"></a><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Skim this initial group of articles or chapters, and collect those that are central to your topic. Throughout this process, simply try to obtain a sense as to whether the article or chapter will make a useful contribution to your understanding of the literature.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">As you identify useful literature, begin designing a <span class="bold">literature map</span> (to be discussed more fully later). This is a visual picture (or figure) of groupings of the literature on the topic that illustrates how your particular study will add to the existing literature and position your study within the larger body of research.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">As you put together the literature map, also begin to draft summaries of the most relevant articles. These summaries are combined into the final literature review that you write for your proposal or research study. Include precise references to the literature using an appropriate style guide, such as the <span class="italic">Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</span> (American Psychological Association [APA], 2010) so that you have a complete reference to use at the end of the proposal or study.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">After summarizing the literature, assemble the literature review, structuring it thematically or organizing it by important concepts. End the literature review with a summary of the major themes and suggest how your particular study further adds to the literature and addresses a gap in the themes. This summary should also point toward the methods (i.e., data collection and data analysis) that need to be undertaken to add to the literature. It is at this point as well that you could advance a critique of the past literature and point out deficiencies in it and issues in its methods (see Boote &amp; Beile, 2005).</li></ol><p id="calibre_link-51" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Searching Computerized Databases</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">To ease the process of collecting relevant material, there are some techniques useful in accessing the literature quickly through databases. <span class="bold">Computer databases of the literature</span> are now available through the Internet, and they provide easy access to thousands of journals, conference papers, and materials on many different topics. Academic libraries at major universities have purchased commercial databases as well as obtained databases in the public domain. Only a few of the major databases available will be reviewed here, but they are the major sources to journal articles and documents that you should consult to determine what literature is available on your topic.</p><p class="calibre_">ERIC is a free online digital library of education research and information sponsored by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. <a id="calibre_link-386"></a>Department of Education. This database can be found at <a href="http://www.eric.ed.gov">www.eric.ed.gov</a>, and ERIC provides a search of 1.2 million items indexed since 1966. The collection includes journal articles, books, research syntheses, conference papers, technical reports, policy papers, and other education-related materials. ERIC indexes more than hundreds of journals, and links are available to full-text copies of many of the materials. To best utilize ERIC, it is important to identify appropriate descriptors for your topic, the terms used by indexers to categorize articles or documents. Researchers can search through the <span class="italic">Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors</span> (ERIC, 1975) or browse the online thesaurus. A <span class="bold">research tip</span> in conducting an ERIC search is to locate recent journal articles and documents on your topic. This process can be enhanced by conducting a preliminary search using descriptors from the online thesaurus and locating a journal article or document which is on your topic. Then look closely at the descriptors used in this article and document and run another search using these terms. This procedure will maximize the possibility of obtaining a good list of articles for your literature review.</p><p class="calibre_">Another free database to search is Google Scholar. It provides a way to broadly search for literature across many disciplines and sources, such as peer-reviewed papers, theses, books, abstracts, and articles from academic publishers, professional societies, universities, and other scholarly organizations. The articles identified in a Google Scholar search provide links to abstracts, related articles, electronic versions of articles affiliated with a library you specify, web searches for information about this work, and opportunities to purchase the full text of the article.</p><p class="calibre_">Researchers can obtain abstracts to publications in the health sciences through the free-access PubMed. This database is a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, and it includes over 17 million citations from MEDLINE and life science journals for biomedical articles going back to the 1950s (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). PubMed includes links to full-text articles (located in academic libraries) and other related resources. To search PubMed, the researcher uses MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms, the U.S. National Library of Medicine’s controlled vocabulary thesaurus used for indexing articles for MEDLINE/PubMed. This MeSH terminology provides a consistent way to retrieve information about topics that may be described using different terms.</p><p class="calibre_">On the Internet you can also go to other literature search programs. One typically available is ProQuest (<a href="http://proquest.com">http://proquest.com</a>), which enables a researcher to search many different databases, and it is one of the largest online content repositories in the world. Another would be EBSCO publishing, a for-fee online research service, including full-text databases, subject indexes, point-of-care medical reference, historical digital archives, and e-books. The company provides more than 350 databases and nearly 300,000 e-books. Also at academic libraries you can search ERIC, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts, Periodicals Index, Health and Medical Complete, and many more specialized databases (e.g., International Index to Black Periodicals). Because EBSCO taps into many different databases, it can be one search tool to use before using more specialized databases.</p><p id="calibre_link-388" class="calibre_">Another commercially licensed database found in many academic libraries is Sociological Abstracts (Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, <a href="http://www.csa.com">www.csa.com</a>). This database indexes over 2,000 journals; conference papers; relevant dissertation listings; book reviews; and selected books in sociology, social work, and related disciplines. For literature in the field of psychology and related areas, consult another commercial database: PsycINFO (<a href="http://www.apa.org">www.apa.org</a>). This database indexes 2,150 journal titles, books, and dissertations from many countries. It covers the field of psychology as well as psychological aspects of physiology, linguistics, anthropology, business, and law. It has a Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms to locate useful terms in a literature search.</p><p class="calibre_">Psychological Abstracts (American Psychological Association [APA], 1927&ndash;) and PsycINFO (apa.org) represent important sources for locating research articles on topics broadly related to psychology. The PsycINFO database is available through libraries and may be accessed through another service, such as EBSCO, Ovid, or ProQuest. PsycINFO indexes nearly 2,500 journals in 22 major categories and it provides bibliographic citations, abstracts for psychological journal articles, dissertations, technical reports, books, and book chapters published worldwide. Similar to an ERIC record, a summary from PsycINFO includes key phrase <span class="italic">identifiers</span> as well as the author, title, source, and a brief abstract of the article.</p><p class="calibre_">Another commercial database available in libraries is the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) (Web of Knowledge, Thomson Scientific [<a href="http://isiwebofknowledge.com">http://isiwebofknowledge.com</a>]). It indexes 1,700 journals spanning 50 disciplines and selectively indexes relevant items from over 3,300 scientific and technical journals. It can be used to locate articles and authors who have conducted research on a topic. It is especially useful in locating studies that have referenced an important study. The SSCI enables you to trace all studies since the publication of the key study that have cited the work. Using this system, you can develop a chronological list of references that document the historical evolution of an idea or study. This chronological list can be most helpful in tracking the development of ideas about your literature review topic.</p><p class="calibre_">In summary, our <span class="bold">research tips</span> for searching computer databases are to do the following:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Use both the free, online literature databases as well as those available through your academic library.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Search several databases, even if you feel that your topic is not strictly education, as found in ERIC, or psychology, as found in PsycInfo. Both ERIC and PsycInfo view education and psychology as broad terms for many topics.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Use guides to terms to locate your articles, such as a thesaurus, when available.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Locate an article that is close to your topic; then look at the terms used to describe it, and use these terms in your search.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Use databases that provide access to full-text copies of your articles (through academic libraries, your Internet connection to a library, or for a fee) as much as possible so that you can reduce the amount of time searching for copies of your articles.</li><a id="calibre_link-248"></a></ul><p id="calibre_link-52" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">A Priority for Selecting Literature Material</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">We recommend that you establish a priority in a search of the literature. What types of literature might be reviewed and in what priority? Consider the following:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Especially if you are examining a topic for the first time and unaware of the research on it, start with broad syntheses of the literature, such as overviews found in encyclopedias (e.g., Aikin, 1992; Keeves, 1988). You might also look for summaries of the literature on your topic presented in journal articles or abstract series (e.g., <span class="italic">Annual Review of Psychology, 1950&ndash;</span>).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Next, turn to journal articles in respected national journals&mdash;especially those that report research studies. By <span class="italic">research</span>, we mean that the author or authors pose a question or hypothesis, collect data, and try to answer the question or hypothesis. There are journals widely read in your field, and typically they are publications with a high-quality editorial board consisting of individuals from around the United States or abroad. By turning to the first few pages, you can determine if an editorial board is listed and whether it is made up of individuals from around the country or world. Start with the most recent issues of the journals, and look for studies about your topic and then work backward in time. Follow up on references at the end of the articles for more sources to examine.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Turn to books related to the topic. Begin with research monographs that summarize the scholarly literature. Then consider entire books on a single topic by a single author or group of authors or books that contain chapters written by different authors.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Follow this search by looking for recent conference papers. Look for major national conferences and the papers delivered at them. Often, conference papers report the latest research developments. Most major conferences either require or request that authors submit their papers for inclusion in computerized indices. Make contact with authors of pertinent studies. Seek them out at conferences. Write or phone them, asking if they know of studies related to your area of interest and inquire also if they have an instrument that might be used or modified for use in your study.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">If time permits, scan the entries in <span class="italic">Dissertation Abstracts</span> (University Microfilms, 1938&ndash;). Dissertations vary immensely in quality, and one needs to be selective in choosing those to review. A search of the <span class="italic">Abstracts</span> might result in one or two relevant dissertations, and you can request copies of them through interlibrary loans or through the University of Michigan Microfilm Library.</li><a id="calibre_link-387"></a><li value="6" class="calibre_16">The web also provides helpful materials for a literature review. The easy access and ability to capture entire articles makes this source of material attractive. However, screen these articles carefully for quality and be cautious about whether they represent rigorous, thoughtful, and systematic research suitable for use in a literature review. Online journals, on the other hand, often include articles that have undergone rigorous reviews by editorial boards. You might check to see if the journal has a refereed editorial board that reviews manuscripts and has published standards for accepting manuscripts in an editorial statement.</li></ol><p class="calibre_">In summary, we place refereed journal articles high on the list because they are the easiest to locate and duplicate. They also report research about a topic. Dissertations are listed lower in priority because they vary considerably in quality and are the most difficult reading material to locate and reproduce. Caution should be used in choosing journal articles on the web unless they are part of refereed online journals.</p><p id="calibre_link-53" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">A Literature Map of the Research</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">One of the first tasks for a researcher working with a new topic is to organize the literature. As mentioned earlier, this organization enables a person to understand how the proposed study adds to, extends, or replicates research already completed.</p><p class="calibre_">A useful approach for this step is to design a literature map. This is an idea that we developed several years ago, and it has been a useful tool for students to use when organizing their review of the literature for making presentations to graduate committees, summarizing the literature for a scholarly presentation, or composing an article for journal publication.</p><p class="calibre_">This map is a visual summary of the research that has been conducted by others, and it is typically represented in a figure. Maps are organized in different ways. One could be a hierarchical structure with a top-down presentation of the literature, ending at the bottom with the proposed study. Another might be similar to a flowchart in which the reader understands the literature as unfolding from left to right with the farthest right-hand section advancing a proposed study. A third model might be a series of circles; each circle represents a body of literature and the intersection of the circles as the place in which the future research is indicated. We have seen examples of all of these possibilities and found them all effective.</p><p id="calibre_link-250" class="calibre_">The central idea is that the researcher begins to build a visual picture of existing research about a topic. This literature map presents an overview of existing literature. <a href="#calibre_link-221">Figure 2.1</a> is an illustration of a map that shows the literature found on procedural justice in organizational studies (Janovec, 2001). Janovec’s map illustrates a hierarchical design, and she used several principles of good map design:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">She placed her topic in the box at the top of the hierarchy.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Next, she took the studies that she found in computer searches, located copies of these studies, and organized them into three broad subtopics (i.e., Justice Perceptions Formation, Justice Effects, and Justice in Organizational Change). For another map, the researcher may have more or fewer than three major categories, depending on the extent and publications on the topic.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Within each box are labels that describe the nature of the studies in the box (i.e., outcomes).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Also within each box are references to major citations illustrating its content. It is useful to use references that are current and illustrative of the topic of the box and to briefly state the references in an appropriate style, such as APA (APA, 2010).</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Consider several levels for the literature map. In other words, major topics lead to subtopics and then to sub-subtopics.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">Some branches of the chart are more developed than others. This development depends on the amount of literature available and the depth of the exploration of the literature by the researcher.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">After organizing the literature into a diagram, Janovec (2001) next considered the branches of the figure that provided a springboard for her proposed study. She placed a “Need to Study” (or proposed study) box at the bottom of the map, she briefly identified the nature of this proposed study (Procedural Justice and Culture), and she then drew lines to past literature that her project would <span class="italic">extend</span>. She proposed this study based on ideas written by other authors in the future research sections of their studies.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">Include quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies in your literature map.</li><li value="9" class="calibre_16">Write a narrative description of your literature map for your committee or for presentation that begins with your topic (the heading box at the top), the databases you have reviewed, the division of the literature into broad topics in the map, the specific topic that you plan to study (at the bottom box of the map), and how your topic relates to various branches in the literature (the connecting lines&mdash;what literature your study builds on and how it builds).</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-299" class="calibre_">Composing a literature map can be challenging. Individuals seeing this map may not be familiar with this approach to organizing the literature and making a case for your study. They need to be told the intent of such a map. It takes time to develop such a map and locate literature to put into the map. For a preliminary map, we consider collecting maybe 25 studies. For a full literature map for a dissertation or thesis, we would consider developing a map with at least 100 studies. Figuring out how your study adds to the literature takes some time. It may add to several threads in your literature map. We would refrain from tying it to all of your subdivisions; select one or two subdivisions. It is also challenging to figure out what the broad topic might be for the top of the map. This is the topic to which your literature map adds. Ask others who know about your literature, see how the research studies group according to some synthesis of the literature, and continually ask yourself what body of literature your study will contribute to. You may also have to develop several versions of your map before it comes together. Develop your map, write the discussion, and check it out with others.</p><p id="calibre_link-54" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Abstracting Studies</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">When researchers write reviews of the literature for proposed studies, they locate articles and develop brief abstracts of the articles that comprise the review. An <span class="bold">abstract</span> is a brief review of the literature (typically a short paragraph) that summarizes major elements to enable a reader to understand the basic features of the article (see <a href="#calibre_link-55">Example 2.1</a>). In developing an abstract, researchers need to consider what material to extract and summarize. This is important information when reviewing perhaps dozens, if not hundreds, of studies. A good summary of a research study reported in a journal might include the following points:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Mention the problem being addressed.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">State the central purpose or focus of the study.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Briefly state information about the sample, population, or subjects.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Review key results that relate to the proposed study.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">If it is a critique or methods review (Cooper, 2010), point out technical and methodological flaws in the study.</li></ul><p class="calibre_">When examining a study to develop a summary, there are places to look for these parts. In well-crafted journal articles, the problem and purpose statements are clearly stated in the introduction. Information about the sample, population, or subjects is found midway through in a method (or procedure) section, and the results are often reported toward the end. In the results sections, look for passages in which the researchers report information to answer or address each research question or hypothesis. For book-length research studies, look for the same points.</p><p id="calibre_link-221" class="calibre_1"></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 2.1</span> An Example of a Literature Map</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000041.jpg" class="calibre_42" /></p><blockquote class="calibre_32">*Employees’ concerns about the fairness of and the making of managerial decisions</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32">Source: Janovec (2001).

He reviewed the literature in several chapters at the beginning of the study. In an example of summarizing a single study advancing a typology, Sudduth summarized the problem, the theme, and the typology:</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">Ginter, Duncan, Richardson, and Swayne (1991) recognize the impact of the external environment on a hospital’s ability to adapt to change. They advocate a process that they call environmental analysis, which allows the organization to strategically determine the best responses to change occurring in the environment. However, after examining the multiple techniques used for environmental analysis, it appears that no comprehensive conceptual scheme or computer model has been developed to provide a complete analysis of environmental issues (Ginter et al., 1991). The result is an essential part of strategic change that relies heavily on a non-quantifiable and judgmental process of evaluation. To assist the hospital manager to carefully assess the external environment, Ginter et al. (1991) have developed the typology given in </span><a href="#calibre_link-221"><span class="calibre3">Figure 2.1</span></a><span class="calibre3">. (p. 44)</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_43">In this example, the authors referenced the study with an in-text reference, mentioned the problem (“a hospital’s ability to adapt to change”), identified the central theme (“a process that they call environmental analysis”), and stated the conclusions related to this theme (e.g., “no comprehensive conceptual model,” “developed the typology”).</p><p id="calibre_link-57" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Style Manuals</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In both examples, we have introduced the idea of using appropriate APA style for referencing the article at the beginning of the abstract. <span class="bold">Style manuals</span> provide guidelines for creating a scholarly style of a manuscript, such as a consistent format for citing references, creating headings, presenting tables and figures, and using nondiscriminatory language. A basic tenet in reviewing the literature is to use an appropriate and consistent reference style throughout. When identifying a useful document, make a complete reference to the source using an appropriate style. For dissertation proposals, graduate students should seek guidance from faculty, dissertation committee members, or department or college officials about the appropriate style manual to use for citing references.</p><p class="calibre_">The <span class="italic">Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</span> (APA, 2010) is the most popular style manual used in the fields of education and psychology. <span class="italic">The Chicago Manual of Style</span> (University of Chicago Press, 2010) is <a id="calibre_link-349"></a>also used but less widely than the APA style in the social sciences. Some journals have developed their own variations of the popular styles. We recommend identifying a style that is acceptable for your writing audiences and adopting it early in the planning process.</p><p class="calibre_">The most important style considerations involve in-text, end-of-text, heading, and figures and tables use. Some suggestions for using style manuals for scholarly writing are these:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">When writing in-text references, keep in mind the appropriate form for types of references and pay close attention to the format for multiple citations.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">When writing the end-of-text references, note whether the style manual calls for them to be alphabetized or numbered. Also, crosscheck that each in-text reference is included in the end-of-text list.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">The headings are ordered in a scholarly paper in terms of levels. First, note how many levels of headings you will have in your research study. Then, refer to the style manual for the appropriate format for each. Typically, research proposals or projects contain between two and four levels of headings.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">If footnotes are used, consult the style manual for their proper placement. Footnotes are used less frequently in scholarly papers today than a few years ago. If you include them, note whether they go at the bottom of the page, the end of each chapter, or at the end of the paper.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Tables and figures have a specific form in each style manual. Note such aspects as bold lines, titles, and spacing in the examples given.</li></ul><p class="calibre_">In summary, the most important aspect of using a style manual is to be consistent in the approach throughout the manuscript.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-58" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Definition of Terms</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Another topic related to reviewing the literature is the identification and <span class="bold">definition of terms</span> that readers will need in order to understand a proposed research project. A definition of terms section may be found separate from the literature review, included as part of the literature review, or placed in different sections of a proposal.</p><p class="calibre_">Define terms that individuals outside the field of study may not understand and that go beyond common language (Locke, Spirduso, &amp; Silverman, 2013). Clearly, whether a term should be defined is a matter of judgment, but define a term if there is any likelihood that readers will not know its meaning. Also, define terms when they first appear so that a reader does not read ahead in the proposal operating with one set of definitions only to find out later that the author is using a different set. As Wilkinson (1991) <a id="calibre_link-328"></a>commented, “scientists have sharply defined terms with which to think clearly about their research and to communicate their findings and ideas accurately” (p. 22). Defining terms also adds precision to a scientific study, as Firestone (1987) stated this:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">The words of everyday language are rich in multiple meanings. Like other symbols, their power comes from the combination of meaning in a specific setting. . . . Scientific language ostensibly strips this multiplicity of meaning from words in the interest of precision. This is the reason common terms are given “technical meanings” for scientific purposes. (p. 17)</blockquote><p class="calibre_3">With this need for precision, one finds terms stated early in the introduction to articles. In dissertations and thesis proposals, terms are typically defined in a special section of the study. The rationale is that in formal research, students must be precise in how they use language and terms. The need to ground thoughts in authoritative definitions constitutes good science.</p><p class="calibre_">Define terms introduced in all sections of the research plan:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">The title of the study</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">The problem statement</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">The purpose statement</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">The research questions, hypotheses, or objectives</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">The literature review</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">The theory base of the study</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">The methods section</li></ul><p class="calibre_">Special terms that need to be defined appear in all three types of studies: (a) qualitative, (b) quantitative, and (c) mixed methods.</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">In qualitative studies, because of the inductive, evolving methodological design, inquirers may define few terms at the beginning though they may advance tentative definitions. Instead, themes (or perspectives or dimensions) may emerge through the data analysis. In the procedure section, authors define these terms in the procedure section as they surface during the process of research. This approach is to delay the definition of terms until they appear in the study, and it makes such definitions difficult to specify in advance in research proposals. For this reason, qualitative proposals often do not include separate sections for a definition of terms. Instead, writers pose tentative, qualitative definitions before entry into the field.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">On the other hand, quantitative studies&mdash;operating more within the deductive model of fixed and set research objectives&mdash;include extensive definitions early in the research proposal. Investigators may place them in separate sections and precisely define them. The researchers try to comprehensively define all relevant terms at the beginning of studies and to use accepted definitions found in the literature.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">In mixed methods studies, the approach to definitions might include a separate section if the study begins with a first phase of quantitative data collection. If it begins with qualitative data collection, then the terms may emerge during the research, and they are defined in the findings or results section of the final report. If both quantitative and qualitative data collection occurs at the same time, then the priority given to one or the other will govern the approach for definitions. However, in all mixed methods studies, there are terms that may be unfamiliar to readers&mdash;for example, the definition of a mixed methods study itself, in a procedural discussion (see <a href="#calibre_link-17">Chapter 10</a>). Also, clarify terms related to the strategy of inquiry used, such as concurrent or sequential, and the specific name for a strategy (e.g., convergent parallel design, as discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-17">Chapter 10</a>).</li><a id="calibre_link-350"></a></ul><p class="calibre_">No one approach governs how one defines the terms in a study, but several suggestions follow (see also Locke et al., 2013):</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Define a term when it first appears in the proposal. In the introduction, for example, a term may require a definition to help the reader understand the research problem and questions or hypotheses in the study.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Write definitions at a specific operational or applied level. Operational definitions are written in specific language rather than abstract, conceptual definitions. Since the definition section in a dissertation provides an opportunity for the author to be specific about the terms used in the study, a preference exists for operational definitions.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Do not define the terms in everyday language; instead, use accepted language available in the research literature. In this way, the terms are grounded in the literature and not invented (Locke et al., 2013).

In this case, provide a definition and use the term consistently throughout the plan and the study (Wilkinson, 1991).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Researchers might define terms so that they accomplish different goals. A definition may describe a common language word (e.g., organization). It may also be paired with a limitation (e.g., the curriculum may be limited). It may establish a criterion (e.g., high grade point average), and it could also define a term operationally (e.g., reinforcement will refer to listing).</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Although no one format exists for defining terms, one approach is to develop a separate section, called the “Definition of Terms,” and clearly set off the terms and their definitions by highlighting the term.

Typically, this separate section is not more than two to three pages in length.</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-351" class="calibre_"><a href="#calibre_link-59">Examples 2.3</a> and <a href="#calibre_link-60">2.4</a> illustrate varied structures for defining terms in a research study.</p><blockquote id="calibre_link-59" class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">Example 2.3 Terms Defined in an Independent Variables Section</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">This set of two examples illustrates an abbreviated form of writing definitions for a study.

In order to address this problem, we have developed a model that provides parameters around the literature review, especially as it might be designed for a quantitative or mixed methods study that employs a standard literature review section. For a qualitative study, the literature review might explore aspects of the central phenomenon being addressed and divide it into topical areas. But the literature review for a qualitative study, as discussed earlier, can be placed in a proposal in several ways (e.g., as a rationale for the research problem, as a separate section, as something threaded throughout the study, as compared with the results of a project).</p><p class="calibre_">For a quantitative study or the quantitative strand of a mixed methods study, write a review of the literature that contains sections about the literature related to major independent variables, major dependent variables, and studies that relate the independent and dependent variables (more on variables in <a href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter 3</a>). This approach seems appropriate for dissertations and for conceptualizing the literature to be introduced in a journal article. Consider a literature review to be composed of five components: (a) an introduction, (b) Topic 1 (about the independent variable), (c) Topic 2 (about the dependent variable), (d) Topic 3, (studies that address both the independent and dependent variables), and (e) a summary.

In qualitative research, the literature helps substantiate the research problem, but it does not constrain the views of participants. A popular approach is to include more literature at the end of a qualitative study than at the beginning. In quantitative research, the literature not only helps to substantiate the problem but it also suggests possible questions or hypotheses that need to be addressed. A separate literature review section is typically found in quantitative studies.

Group these studies into a literature map that shows the major categories of studies and positions of your proposed study within those categories.

In <span class="italic">quantitative research,</span> researchers often test hypotheses stemming from theories. In a quantitative dissertation, an entire section of a research proposal might be devoted to presenting the broader theory guiding the study hypotheses. In <span class="italic">qualitative research,</span> the use of theory is much more varied. The inquirer may generate a theory as the final outcome of a study and place it at the end of a project, such as in grounded theory. In other qualitative studies, it comes at the beginning and provides a lens that shapes what is looked at and the questions asked, such as in ethnographies or in participatory&ndash;social justice research. In mixed methods research, researchers may both test theories and generate them. Moreover, mixed methods research may contain a theoretical framework within which both quantitative and qualitative data are collected. These frameworks can be drawn from feminist, racial, class, or other perspectives and they flow through different parts of a mixed methods study.</p><p class="calibre_">Theories can be used in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies. We begin this chapter by focusing on theory use in a quantitative study. We review a definition of a theory, the use of variables in a quantitative study, the placement of theory, and the alternative forms it might assume in a written plan. Procedures in identifying a theory are next presented, followed by a script of a theoretical perspective section of a quantitative research proposal. Then the discussion moves to the use of theory in a qualitative study. Qualitative inquirers use different terms for theories, such as <span class="italic">patterns, theoretical lens,</span> or <span class="italic">naturalistic generalizations,</span> to describe the broader explanations used or developed in their studies. Examples in this chapter illustrate the alternatives available to qualitative researchers. Finally, the chapter turns to the use of theories in mixed methods research and the use of social science and participatory&ndash;social justice theories in such research.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-65" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Quantitative Theory Use</span></span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Testing Causal Claims in Quantitative Research</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Prior to discussing variables, their types, and their use in quantitative research, we first need to visit the concept of <span class="italic">causality</span> in quantitative research. A leading writer in this area has been Blalock (1991). Causality means that we would expect variable X to cause variable Y. As a simple example, does drinking one glass of red wine daily <span class="italic">cause</span> you to have a <a id="calibre_link-280"></a>reduced risk for a heart attack? In this case, daily wine consumption is the X variable, and a heart attack event would be the Y variable. One critically important consideration in evaluating causal claims (like this red wine consumption example) is whether an unmeasured third variable (Z) may be the cause of the outcome you are measuring. For example, there may be a Z variable (such as daily exercise) that is positively associated with both moderate red wine consumption and with heart attacks, and may be the causal factor for reducing heart attacks (not moderate red wine consumption!). In quantitative research this third variable is called a <span class="italic">confounding variable</span>, and can become quite problematic for establishing causality if it is not measured in a study. We would not want to mistakenly infer that moderate red wine consumption promotes heart health if it plays no causal role in reducing heart attacks. If you aim to test a causal claim about the relationship between two or more variables in your quantitative study, your best choice is to conduct a true experiment, which will provide more control over potential confounding variables (see <a href="#calibre_link-15">Chapter 8</a>). If you are less interested in testing a causal claim or if you cannot conduct an experiment, then survey methods can be used to test claims about hypothesized associations between variables (see <a href="#calibre_link-15">Chapter 8</a>)&mdash;for example, you may be interested in first establishing if a positive association exists between moderate daily red wine consumption and clinical markers of heart disease risk in a correlation analysis. Indeed, a number of epidemiological health science studies highlight a positive association between moderate daily red wine consumption (1&ndash;2 drinks per day) and a 20% reduction in risk for heart disease (e.g., Szmitko &amp; Verma, 2005).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-67" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Variables in Quantitative Research</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Before discussing quantitative theories, it is important to understand variables and the types that are used in forming theories. A <span class="bold">variable</span> refers to a characteristic or attribute of an individual or an organization that can be measured or observed and that varies among the people or organization being studied. Variables often measured in studies include gender; age; socioeconomic status (SES); and attitudes or behaviors such as racism, social control, political power, or leadership. Several texts provide detailed discussions about the types of variables one can use and their scales of measurement (e.g., Isaac &amp; Michael, 1981; Keppel, 1991; Kerlinger, 1979; Thompson, 2006; Thorndike, 1997). Variables are distinguished by two characteristics: (a) <span class="italic">temporal order</span> and (b) their measurement (or observation).</p><p class="calibre_">Temporal order means that one variable precedes another in time. Because of this time ordering, it is said that one variable affects or predicts another variable. Temporal order also means that quantitative researchers think about variables in an order from “left to right” (Punch, 2014) and order the variables in purpose statements, research questions, and visual models into left-to-right, cause-and-effect type presentations. Types of variables include the following:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Independent variables</span> are those that influence, or affect outcomes in experimental studies. They are described as “independent” because they are variables that are manipulated in an experiment and thus independent of all other influences. Using the earlier example, you may decide to run an eight-week experimental study where you ask some participants to drink one glass of red wine daily (red wine group), whereas other participants in a comparison group are instructed to maintain their normal consumption patterns (control group). You are systematically manipulating red wine consumption, and thus moderate red wine consumption is an independent variable in this study. Independent variables are also commonly referred to as <span class="italic">treatment</span> or <span class="italic">manipulated</span> variables in experimental studies.</li><a id="calibre_link-326"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Dependent variables</span> are those that depend on the independent variables; they are the outcomes or results of the influence of the independent variables. We recommend that one aim to measure multiple dependent measures in experimental studies, and in the red wine example a researcher might consider measuring dependent variables such as heart attack incidence, strokes, and/or the amount of arterial atherosclerotic plaque formations.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Predictor variables</span> (also called <span class="italic">antecedent</span> variables) are variables that are used to predict an outcome of interest in survey method studies. Predictor variables are similar to independent variables in that they are hypothesized to affect outcomes in a study, but dissimilar because the researcher is not able to systematically manipulate a predictor variable. It may not be possible or feasible to assign individuals to a red wine consumption or control group (as an independent variable) but it may be possible to measure naturally occurring red wine consumption in a community sample as a predictor variable.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Outcome variables</span> (also called <span class="italic">criterion</span> or <span class="italic">response</span> variables) are variables that are considered outcomes or results of predictor variables in survey method studies. They share the same properties as dependent variables (described above). <p class="calibre_">Other types of variables provide a supporting cast in quantitative research, and we recommend that you make efforts to identify and measure these variables in your quantitative research study:</p></li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Intervening</span> or <span class="italic">mediating variables(Intervening or mediating variables)</span> stand between the independent and dependent variables, and they transmit the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable (for a review, see MacKinnon, Fairchild, &amp; Fritz, 2007). A mediating variable can be tested using different kinds of statistical mediation analyses (see MacKinnon et al., 2007, for some examples), and provides a quantitative assessment of how the independent variable is exerting its effects on the dependent variable (or in the case of survey method studies how a predictor variable may be exerting its effects on an outcome variable of interest). One leading idea is that the polyphenol compounds in red wine are what is driving the health benefits of moderate red wine consumption (e.g., Szmitko &amp; Verma, 2005), so one possibility could be to measure the amount of polyphenols occurring in a red wine consumption study as a mediating variable. Researchers use statistical procedures (e.g., analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]) to control for these variables.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Moderating variables</span> are predictor variables that affect the direction and/or the strength of the relationship between independent and dependent variables, or between predictor and outcome variables (Thompson, 2006). These variables act on or intersect with the independent variables, and then together in combination with the independent variables influence the dependent variables. Moderating variables are powerful in that they can identify potential boundary conditions (e.g., participant gender; are the effects of moderate red wine consumption on heart attacks much larger for males compared to females?) of the effect of interest.</li><a id="calibre_link-335"></a></ul><p class="calibre_">In a quantitative research study, variables are related to answer a research question, and while we have focused our discussion on the simple red wine&ndash;heart disease relationship, these variables and links can be extended to a multitude of other phenomena that we care to understand (e.g., “How does self-esteem influence the formation of friendships among adolescents?” “Does number of overtime hours worked cause higher burnout among nurses?”). Specifically, we use our theories and specification of variables to generate hypotheses. A <span class="italic">hypothesis</span> is a prediction about a specific event or relationship between variables.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-68" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Definition of a Theory in Quantitative Research</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">With this background on variables, we can proceed to the use of quantitative theories. In quantitative research, some historical precedent exists for viewing a theory as a scientific prediction or explanation for what the researcher expects to find (see Thomas, 1997, for different ways of conceptualizing theories and how they might constrain thought). For example, Kerlinger’s (1979) definition of a theory seems still valid today. He said that a theory is “a set of interrelated constructs (variables), definitions, and propositions that presents a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relations among variables, with the purpose of explaining natural phenomena” (p. 64).</p><p class="calibre_">In this definition, a <span class="bold">theory in quantitative research</span> is an interrelated set of constructs (or variables) formed into propositions, or hypotheses, that specify the relationship among variables (typically in terms of magnitude or direction). A theory might appear in a research study as an argument, a discussion, a figure, a rationale, or a conceptual framework, and it helps to explain (or predict) phenomena that occur in the world. Labovitz and Hagedorn (1971) added to this definition the idea of a <span class="italic">theoretical rationale,</span> which they defined as “specifying how and why the variables and relational <a id="calibre_link-266"></a>statements are interrelated” (p. 17). Why would an independent variable, X, influence or affect a dependent variable, Y? The theory would provide the explanation for this expectation or prediction. A discussion about this theory would appear in a section of a proposal on the literature review or in a separate section called the <span class="italic">theory base,</span> the theoretical rationale, or the <span class="italic">theoretical perspective</span> or the <span class="italic">conceptual framework..</span> We prefer the term <span class="italic">theoretical perspective</span> because it has been popularly used as a required section for proposals for research when one submits an application to present a paper at the American Educational Research Association conference.</p><p class="calibre_">The metaphor of a rainbow can help to visualize how a theory operates. Assume that the rainbow <span class="italic">bridges</span> the independent and dependent variables (or constructs) in a study. This rainbow ties together the variables and provides an overarching explanation for <span class="italic">how</span> and <span class="italic">why</span> one would expect the independent variable to explain or predict the dependent variable. Theories develop when researchers test a prediction over and over.</p><p class="calibre_">For example, here is how the process of developing a theory works. Investigators combine independent, mediating, and dependent variables into questions based on different forms of measures. These questions provide information about the type of relationship (positive, negative, or unknown) and its magnitude (e.g., high or low). Forming this information into a predictive statement (hypothesis), a researcher might write, “The greater the centralization of power in leaders, the greater the disenfranchisement of the followers.” When researchers test hypotheses such as this over and over in different settings and with different populations (e.g., the Boy Scouts, a Presbyterian church, the Rotary Club, and a group of high school students), a theory emerges, and someone gives it a name (e.g., a theory of attribution). Thus, theory develops as an explanation to advance knowledge in particular fields (Thomas, 1997).</p><p class="calibre_">Another aspect of theories is that they vary in their breadth of coverage. Neuman (2009) reviewed theories at three levels: (a) micro-level, (b) meso-level, and (c) macro-level. Micro-level theories provide explanations limited to small slices of time, space, or numbers of people, such as Goffman’s theory of face work, which explains how people engage in rituals during face-to-face interactions. Meso-level theories link the micro and macro levels. These are theories of organizations, social movement, or communities, such as Collins’s theory of control in organizations. Macro-level theories explain larger aggregates, such as social institutions, cultural systems, and whole societies. Lenski’s macro-level theory of social stratification, for example, explains how the amount of surplus a society produces increases with the development of the society.</p><p class="calibre_">Theories are found in the social science disciplines of psychology, sociology, anthropology, education, and economics, as well as within many subfields. To locate and read about these theories requires searching literature databases (e.g., <span class="italic">Psychological Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts</span>) or reviewing guides to the literature about theories (e.g., see Webb, Beals, &amp; White, 1986).</p><p id="calibre_link-69" class="calibre_1">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Forms of Theories in Quantitative Research</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Researchers state their theories in research proposals in several ways, such as a series of hypotheses, if-then logic statements, or visual models. First, some researchers state theories in the form of interconnected hypotheses. For example, Hopkins (1964) conveyed his theory of influence processes as a series of 15 hypotheses. Some of the hypotheses are as follows (these have been slightly altered to remove the gender-specific pronouns):</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">The higher one’s rank, the greater one’s centrality.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">The greater one’s centrality, the greater one’s observability.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">The higher one’s rank, the greater one’s observability.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">The greater one’s centrality, the greater one’s conformity.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">The higher one’s rank, the greater one’s conformity.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">The greater one’s observability, the greater one’s conformity.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">The greater one’s conformity, the greater one’s observability. (p. 51)</li></ol><p class="calibre_">A second way is to state a theory as a series of if-then statements that explain why one would expect the independent variables to influence or cause the dependent variables. For example, Homans (1950) explained a theory of interaction:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">If the frequency of interaction between two or more persons increases, the degree of their liking for one another will increase, and vice versa. . . . Persons who feel sentiments of liking for one another will express those sentiments in activities over and above the activities of the external system, and these activities may further strengthen the sentiments of liking. The more frequently persons interact with one another, the more alike in some respects both their activities and their sentiments tend to become. (pp. 112, 118, 120)</blockquote><p class="calibre_3">Third, an author may present a theory as a visual model. It is useful to translate variables into a visual picture. Blalock (1969, 1985, 1991) advocated causal modeling and recasted verbal theories into causal models so that a reader could visualize the interconnections of variables. Two simplified examples are presented here. As shown in <a href="#calibre_link-222">Figure 3.1</a>, three independent variables influence a single dependent variable, mediated by the influence of two intervening variables. A diagram such as this one shows the possible causal sequence among variables leading to modeling through path analysis and more advanced analyses using multiple measures of variables as found in structural equation modeling (see Kline, 1998). At an introductory level, Duncan (1985) provided useful suggestions about the notation for constructing these visual causal diagrams:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Position the dependent variables on the right in the diagram and the independent variables on the left.</li><a id="calibre_link-325"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Use one-way arrows leading from each determining variable to each variable dependent on it.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Indicate the strength of the relationship among variables by inserting valence signs on the paths. Use positive or negative valences that postulate or infer relationships.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Use two-headed arrows connected to show unanalyzed relationships between variables not dependent upon other relationships in the model.</li></ul><p class="calibre_">More complicated causal diagrams can be constructed with additional notation. This one portrays a basic model of limited variables, such as typically found in a survey research study.</p><p class="calibre_">A variation on this theme is to have independent variables in which control and experimental groups are compared on one independent variable in terms of an outcome (dependent variable). As shown in <a href="#calibre_link-223">Figure 3.2</a>, two groups on variable X are compared in terms of their influence on Y, the dependent variable. This design is a between-groups experimental design (see <a href="#calibre_link-15">Chapter 8</a>). The same rules of notation previously discussed apply.</p><p id="calibre_link-222" class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 3.1</span> Three Independent Variables Influence a Single Dependent Variable Mediated by Two Intervening Variables</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000000.jpg" class="calibre_45" /></p><p id="calibre_link-223" class="calibre_1"></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 3.2</span> Two Groups With Different Treatments on X Are Compared in Terms of Y</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000011.jpg" class="calibre_46" /></p><blockquote class="calibre_32">Source: Jungnickel (1990). Reprinted with permission.</blockquote><p class="calibre_3">These two models are meant only to introduce possibilities for connecting independent and dependent variables to build theories. More complicated designs employ multiple independent and dependent variables in elaborate models of causation (Blalock, 1969, 1985, 1991). For example, Jungnickel (1990), in a doctoral dissertation proposal about research productivity among faculty in pharmacy schools, presented a complex visual model, as shown in <a href="#calibre_link-224">Figure 3.3</a>. Jungnickel asked what factors influence a faculty member’s scholarly research performance. After identifying these factors in the literature, he adapted a theoretical framework found in nursing research (Megel, Langston, &amp; Creswell, 1987) and developed a visual model portraying the relationship among these factors, following the rules for constructing a model introduced earlier. He listed the independent variables on the far left, the intervening variables in the middle, and the dependent variables on the right. The direction of influence flowed from the left to the right, and he used plus and minus signs to indicate the hypothesized direction.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Placement of Quantitative Theories</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In quantitative studies, one uses theory deductively and places it toward the beginning of the proposed study. With the objective of testing or verifying a theory rather than developing it, the researcher advances a theory, collects data to test it, and reflects on its confirmation or disconfirmation by the results. The theory becomes a framework for the entire study, an organizing model for the research questions or hypotheses and for the data collection procedure. The deductive model of thinking used in a quantitative study is shown in <a href="#calibre_link-225">Figure 3.4</a>. The researcher tests or verifies a theory by examining hypotheses or questions derived from it. These hypotheses or questions contain variables (or constructs) that the researcher needs to define. Alternatively, an acceptable definition might be found in the literature. From here, the investigator locates an instrument to use in measuring or observing attitudes or behaviors of participants in a study. Then the investigator collects scores on these instruments to confirm or disconfirm the theory.</p><p id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre_1"></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 3.3</span> A Visual Model of a Theory of Faculty Scholarly Performance</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000010.jpg" class="calibre_47" /></p><blockquote class="calibre_32">Source: Jungnickel (1990).

This conception of behavior attempts to achieve a balanced synthesis of cognitive psychology with the principles of behavior modification (Bower &amp; Hilgard, 1981). Basically, this unified theoretical framework “approaches the explanation of human behavior in terms of a continuous (reciprocal) interaction between cognitive, behavioral, and environmental determinants” (Bandura, 1977, p. vii). </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Author identifies the theory for the study.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">While social learning theory accepts the application of reinforcements such as shaping principles, it tends to see the role of rewards as both conveying information about the optimal response and providing incentive motivation for a given act because of the anticipated reward. In addition, the learning principles of this theory place special emphasis on the important roles played by vicarious, symbolic, and self-regulating processes (Bandura, 1971).</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Social learning theory not only deals with learning, but also seeks to describe how a group of social and personal competencies (so called personality) could evolve out of social conditions within which the learning occurs. It also addresses techniques of personality assessment (Mischel, 1968), and behavior modification in clinical and educational settings (Bandura, 1977; Bower &amp; Hilgard, 1981; Rotter, 1954). </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Author describes social learning theory.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Further, the principles of social learning theory have been applied to a wide range of social behavior such as competitiveness, aggressiveness, sex roles, deviance, and pathological behavior (Bandura &amp; Walters, 1963; Bandura, 1977; Mischel, 1968; Miller &amp; Dollard, 1941; Rotter, 1954; Staats, 1975). </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Author describes the use of the theory.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Explaining social learning theory, Rotter (1954) indicated that four classes of variables must be considered: behavior, expectancies, reinforcement, and psychological situations. A general formula for behavior was proposed which states: “the potential for a behavior to occur in any specific psychological situation is the function of the expectancy that the behavior will lead to a particular reinforcement in that situation and the value of that reinforcement” (Rotter, 1975, p. 57).</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Expectancy within the formula refers to the perceived degree of certainty (or probability) that a causal relationship generally exists between behavior and rewards. This construct of generalized expectancy has been defined as internal locus of control when an individual believes that reinforcements are a function of specific behavior, or as external locus of control when the effects are attributed to luck, fate, or powerful others. The perceptions of causal relationships need not be absolute positions, but rather tend to vary in degree along a continuum depending upon previous experiences and situational complexities (Rotter, 1966). </span><a id="calibre_link-322"></a><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Author explains variables in the theory.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">In the application of social learning theory to this study of scholarly productivity, the four classes of variables identified by Rotter (1954) will be defined in the following manner.</span></blockquote><div class="calibre_38">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Scholarly productivity is the desired behavior or activity.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Locus of control is the generalized expectancy that rewards are or are not dependent upon specific behaviors.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Reinforcements are the rewards from scholarly work and the value attached to these rewards.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">The educational institution is the psychological situation which furnishes many of the rewards for scholarly productivity.</span></li></ol><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">With these specific variables, the formula for behavior which was developed by Rotter (1975) would be adapted to read: The potential for scholarly behavior to occur within an educational institution is a function of the expectancy that this activity will lead to specific rewards and of the value that the faculty member places on these rewards. In addition, the interaction of interpersonal trust with locus of control must be considered in relation to the expectancy of attaining rewards through behaviors (Rotter, 1967). Finally, certain characteristics, such as educational preparation, chronological age, post-doctoral fellowships, tenure, or full-time versus part-time employment may be associated with the scholarly productivity of nurse faculty in a manner similar to that seen within other disciplines. </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Author applied the concepts to her study.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">The following statement represents the underlying logic for designing and conducting this study.

First, much like in quantitative research, it is used as a broad explanation for behavior and attitudes, and it may be complete with variables, constructs, and hypotheses. For example, ethnographers employ cultural themes or aspects of culture to study in their qualitative projects, such as social control, language, stability and change, or social organization, such as kinship or families (see Wolcott’s <a id="calibre_link-327"></a>2008 discussion about texts that address cultural topics in anthropology). Themes in this context provide a ready-made series of hypotheses to be tested from the literature. Although researchers might not refer to them as theories, they provide broad explanations that anthropologists use to study the culture-sharing behavior and attitudes of people. This approach is popular in qualitative health science research in which investigators begin with a theoretical or conceptual model, such as the adoption of health practices or a quality of life theoretical orientation.</p><p class="calibre_">Second, researchers increasingly use a <span class="bold">theoretical lens or perspective in qualitative research,</span> which provides an overall orienting lens for the study of questions of gender, class, and race (or other issues of marginalized groups). This lens becomes a transformative perspective that shapes the types of questions asked, informs how data are collected and analyzed, and provides a call for action or change. Qualitative research of the 1980s underwent a transformation to broaden its scope of inquiry to include these theoretical lenses. They guide the researchers as to what issues are important to examine (e.g., marginalization, empowerment, oppression, power) and the people who need to be studied (e.g., women, low economic social status, ethnic and racial groups, sexual orientation, disability). They also indicate how the researcher positions himself or herself in the qualitative study (e.g., up front or biased from personal, cultural, and historical contexts) and how the final written accounts need to be written (e.g., without further marginalizing individuals, by collaborating with participants), and recommendations for changes to improve lives and society. In critical ethnography studies, for example, researchers begin with a theory that informs their studies. This causal theory might be one of emancipation or repression (Thomas, 1993).</p><p class="calibre_">Some of these qualitative theoretical perspectives available to the researcher are as follows:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Feminist perspectives</span> view as problematic women’s diverse situations and the institutions that frame those situations.

The research using this approach does not objectify individuals, is concerned with cultural and political means, and conveys the voices and experiences of individuals who have been suppressed (Gamson, 2000).</li><a id="calibre_link-300"></a><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Disability inquiry</span> addresses understanding this population’s sociocultural perspectives allowing them to take control over their lives rather than a biological understanding of disability (Mertens, 2009).</li></ul><p class="calibre_">Rossman and Rallis (2012) captured the sense of theory as critical and postmodern perspectives in qualitative inquiry:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">As the 20th century draws to a close, traditional social science has come under increasing scrutiny and attack as those espousing critical and postmodern perspectives challenge objectivist assumptions and traditional norms for the conduct of research. The critical tradition is alive and well in the social sciences. Postmodernists reject the notion that knowledge is definite and univocal. Central to this attack are four interrelated assertions: (a) Research fundamentally involves issues of power; (b) the research report is not transparent but rather it is authored by a raced, gendered, classed, and politically oriented individual; (c) race, class, and gender (the canonical triumvirate to which we would add sexual orientation, able-bodiedness, and first language, among others) are crucial for understanding experience; and (d) historically, traditional research has silenced members of oppressed and marginalized groups. (p. 91)</blockquote><p class="calibre_3">Third, distinct from this theoretical orientation are qualitative studies in which theory (or some other broad explanation) becomes the <span class="italic">end point</span>. It is an inductive process of building from the data to broad themes to a generalized model or theory (see Punch, 2014). The logic of this inductive approach is shown in <a href="#calibre_link-227">Figure 3.5</a>.</p><p class="calibre_">The researcher begins by gathering detailed information from participants and then forms this information into categories or themes. These themes are developed into broad patterns, theories, or generalizations that are then compared with personal experiences or with existing literature on the topic.</p><p class="calibre_">The development of themes and categories into patterns, theories, or generalizations suggests varied end points for qualitative studies. For example, in case study research, Stake (1995) referred to an assertion as a <span class="italic">propositional generalization</span>&mdash;the researcher’s summary of interpretations and claims&mdash;to which is added the researcher’s own personal experiences, called “naturalistic generalizations” (p. 86). As another example, grounded theory provides a different end point. Inquirers hope to discover and advance a theory that is grounded in information from participants (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998). Lincoln and Guba (1985) referred to “pattern theories” as <a id="calibre_link-333"></a>explanations that develop during naturalistic or qualitative research. Rather than the deductive form found in quantitative studies, these pattern theories or generalizations represent interconnected thoughts or parts linked to a whole.</p><p class="calibre_">Fourth and finally, some qualitative studies <span class="italic">do not employ any explicit theory.</span> However, the case can be made that no qualitative study begins from pure observation and that prior conceptual structure composed of theory and method provides the starting point for all observations (Schwandt, 2014). Still, one sees qualitative studies that contain no <span class="italic">explicit</span> theoretical orientation, such as in phenomenology, in which inquirers attempt to build the essence of experience from participants (e.g., see Riemen, 1986). In these studies, the inquirer constructs a rich, detailed description of a central phenomenon.</p><p class="calibre_">Our <span class="bold">research tips</span> on theory use in a qualitative proposal are as follows:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Decide if theory is to be used in the qualitative proposal.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">If it is used, then identify how the theory will be used in the study, such as an up-front explanation, as an end point, or as a transformative-advocacy lens.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Locate the theory in the proposal early in the study or at the end.</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-227" class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 3.5</span> The Inductive Logic of Research in a Qualitative Study</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000036.jpg" class="calibre_50" /></p><p id="calibre_link-75" class="calibre_1">

In those studies with a cultural theme or a theoretical lens, the theory occurs in the opening passages of the study (see <a href="#calibre_link-76">Example 3.2</a>). Consistent with the emerging design of qualitative inquiry, the theory may appear at the beginning and be modified or adjusted based on participant views. Even in the most theory-oriented qualitative design, such as critical ethnography, Lather (1986) qualified the use of theory:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">Building empirically grounded theory requires a reciprocal relationship between data and theory. Data must be allowed to generate propositions in a dialectical manner that permits use of <span class="italic">a priori</span> theoretical frameworks, but which keeps a particular framework from becoming the container into which the data must be poured. (p. 267)</blockquote><blockquote id="calibre_link-76" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre3">Example 3.2 A Theory Early in a Qualitative Study</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Murguia, Padilla, and Pavel (1991) studied the integration of 24 Hispanic and Native American students into the social system of a college campus. They were curious about how ethnicity influenced social integration, and they began by relating the participants’ experiences to a theoretical model, the Tinto model of social integration. They felt that the model had been “incompletely conceptualized and, as a consequence, only imprecisely understood and measured” (p. 433).</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Thus, the model was not being tested, as one would find in a quantitative project, but modified. At the end of the study, the authors refined Tinto’s model and advanced their modification that described how ethnicity functions. In contrast to this approach, in qualitative studies with an end point of a theory (e.g., a grounded theory), a pattern, or a generalization, the theory emerges at the end of the study. This theory might be presented as a logic diagram, a visual representation of relationships among concepts.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_3">As <a href="#calibre_link-78">Example 3.3</a> shows, we developed a visual model that interrelated variables, derived this model inductively from informant comments, and placed the model at the end of the study, where the central propositions in it could be contrasted with the existing theories and literature.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-77" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Mixed Methods Theory Use</span></span></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Theory use in mixed methods</span> studies may include using theory deductively, in quantitative theory testing and validity, or in using it inductively as in an emerging qualitative theory or pattern. In addition, there are several unique ways that theory is incorporated into a mixed methods study in which researchers collect, analyze, and integrate both quantitative and qualitative data using diverse mixed methods designs. This framework has taken two forms: (a) the use of a social science framework and (b) the use of a participatory&ndash;social justice framework. Both of these forms have emerged in the mixed methods literature over the past 5 to 10 years (see Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011).</p><blockquote id="calibre_link-78" class="calibre_44"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre_37">

Contrary to proposition 2.1, we expected that the career stages would be similar not in type of issue but in the range of issues. Instead we found that the issues for post-tenure faculty covered almost all the possible problems on the list. Why were the tenured faculty’s needs more extensive than non-tenured faculty? The research productivity literature suggests that one’s research performance does not decline with the award of tenure (Holley 1977). Perhaps diffuse career goals of post-tenure faculty expand the possibilities for “types” of issues.

These authors presented a mixed methods study to understand how learned resourcefulness empowers individuals. In this study, they gathered quantitative measures on Rosenbaum’s Self-Control Schedule (SCS) and collected interviews with patients coping with chronic pain. In the opening paragraph of their study, they advanced the purpose:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">Taking a critical realist perspective informed by Rosenbaum’s (1990, 2000) model of self-control, we combine a quantitative measure of learned resourcefulness with a qualitative text-based analysis to characterize the processes that come into play in the self-management of pain for high&mdash;and low&mdash;resourceful clients following a multimodel treatment-based pain program. (p. 318)</blockquote><p class="calibre_3">Following this passage, they then advanced the model of learned resourcefulness that guided their study. They introduced the major components of Rosenbaum’s model. This was then followed by the research literature on resourcefulness as an important predictor of adopting healthy behavior and a discussion of one of Rosenbaum’s experiments relating resourcefulness to coping with pain. The authors then discussed the factors of <a id="calibre_link-262"></a>the model leading to self-control, such as factors related to process-regulating cognitions (e.g., supporting family and friends), coping strategies (e.g., ability to cope with pain such as diverting attention and reinterpreting pain), and staying in (or dropping out of) programs. The authors at this point might have drawn a diagram of the theory to be explicit about factors that influenced self-control. They provided next, however, a series of questions drawn from Rosenbaum’s model and the literature that guided their study examining the impact of a cognitive-behavioral chronic pain management program on self-management and how resourcefulness and a sense of self-directedness influence self-management skills for chronic pain. Toward the end of the article, they revisited the factors leading to self-management and proposed a diagram of the most salient factors.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Participatory&ndash;Social Justice Theory Use</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">The use and acceptability of participatory&ndash;social justice theories in mixed methods research have been growing in the last decade. Undoubtedly, the impetus for this has been the work of Mertens (2003, 2009), who has not only conveyed the major purpose of this theory but also how it might be incorporated into the general research process and mixed methods. Both participatory and social justice frameworks have the effect of involving participants collaboratively in the research, bringing about change to address inequities, and helping underrepresented groups and populations. A number of empirical articles have appeared in the <span class="italic">Journal of Mixed Methods Research</span> advancing this theory-use in mixed methods, including a study of women’s interest in science (Buck, Cook, Quigley, Eastwood, &amp; Lucas, 2009) and a study of women’s social capital (Hodgkin, 2008). A paper by Sweetman (2008) identified 34 mixed methods studies that utilized a transformative framework. Then in 2010, Sweetman, Badiee, and Creswell (2010) discussed transformative criteria&mdash;drawing on Mertens (2003, 2009)&mdash;that might be incorporated into mixed methods studies and surveyed 13 studies that included elements of the criteria.</p><p class="calibre_">The literature is growing on the use of this theoretical orientation framework and mixed methods research. It seems especially applicable to the study of community health issues and the study of marginalized groups, wherever they might appear in the world. Undergirding this theoretical orientation would be a broader philosophical stance, the transformative framework, as discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter 1</a>. In <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter 1</a>, we discussed the transformative worldview as one of the four primary worldviews that would inform quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research. Indeed, one could question whether the transformative framework lies at a broad, philosophical worldview level or at a narrower, more theoretical level informing what one might learn and explain in a study. Two issues have dominated the discussion of using a transformative framework in mixed methods: (a) What is a transformative framework? and (b) How would a mixed methods researcher incorporate it into a rigorous, sophisticated mixed methods study? Here we <a id="calibre_link-263"></a>discuss it as a theoretical framework that can surround and inform a mixed methods project.</p><p class="calibre_">A transformative mixed methods framework (also called the transformative research paradigm; Mertens, 2009) is a set of assumptions and procedures used in research. Common themes are as follows:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Underlying assumptions that rely on ethical stances of inclusion and challenging oppressive social structures.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">An entry process into the community that is designed to build trust and make goals and strategies transparent.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Dissemination of findings in ways that encourage use of the results to enhance social justice and human rights. (p. 5)</li></ul><p class="calibre_">Further, the transformative approach applies to people who experience discrimination and oppression, including (but not limited to) race/ethnicity, disability, immigrant status, political conflicts, sexual orientation, poverty, gender, and age (Mertens, 2010).</p><p class="calibre_">How this framework is integrated into a mixed methods study is still evolving, but Mertens (2003) identified several elements of the framework as they relate to the steps in the process of research. These elements are mentioned in <a href="#calibre_link-81">Box 3.1</a>. Reading through these questions, one gains a sense of the importance of studying issues of discrimination and oppression and of recognizing diversity among study participants. These questions also address treating individuals respectfully through gathering and communicating data collection and through reporting results that lead to changes in social processes and relationships.</p><p class="calibre_">These questions were further operationalized as a set of 10 criteria (and questions) that one might use to evaluate the inclusion of transformative theoretical thinking into a mixed methods study (Sweetman et al., 2010):</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Did the authors openly reference a problem in a community of concern?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Did the authors openly declare a theoretical lens?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Were the research questions written with an advocacy lens?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Did the literature review include discussions of diversity and oppression?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Did authors discuss appropriate labeling of the participants?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">Did the data collection and outcomes benefit the community?</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">Did the participants initiate the research, and/or were they actively engaged in the project?</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">Did the results elucidate power relationships?</li><li value="9" class="calibre_16">Did the results facilitate social change?</li><li value="10" class="calibre_16">Did the authors explicitly state use of a transformative framework?</li></ol><blockquote id="calibre_link-81" class="calibre_44"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre_37">

Toward the beginning of her article, she discussed the feminist research component of her study, such as drawing attention to the lack of gender focus in studies of social capital, using qualitative and quantitative research to give voice to women’s experiences, and locating her study within the transformative paradigm. Through her quantitative results, she found a difference in social capital for men and women, and then she explored in a second phase the viewpoints of women, noting women’s involvement in informal social participation and community participation. Participation in civic levels of involvement were low, and themes resulting from women were related to wanting to be a “good mother,” wanting to avoid social isolation, and wanting to be an active citizen.</span><a id="calibre_link-392"></a></blockquote><blockquote id="calibre_link-83" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre3">Summary</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Theory has a place in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research. Researchers use theory in a quantitative study to provide an explanation or prediction about the relationship among variables in the study. Thus, it is essential to have grounding in the nature and use of variables as they form research questions and hypotheses. A theory explains how and why the variables are related, acting as a bridge between or among the variables. Theory may be broad or narrow in scope, and researchers state their theories in several ways, such as a series of hypotheses, if-then logic statements, or visual models. Using theories deductively, investigators advance them at the beginning of the study in the literature review. They also include them with the hypotheses or research questions or place them in a separate section. A script can help design the theory section for a research proposal.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">In qualitative research, inquirers employ theory as a broad explanation, much like in quantitative research, such as in ethnographies. It may also be a theoretical lens or perspective that raises questions related to gender, class, race, or some combination of these. Theory also appears as an end point of a qualitative study, a generated theory, a pattern, or a generalization that emerges inductively from data collection and analysis. Grounded theorists, for example, generate a theory grounded in the views of participants and place it as the conclusion of their studies. Some qualitative studies do not include an explicit theory and present descriptive research of the central phenomenon.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Mixed methods researchers use theory as a framework informing many aspects of design as they collect, analyze, and interpret quantitative and qualitative data. This framework takes two forms: (a) a social science framework or (b) a participatory&ndash;social justice framework. A social science framework is placed at the beginning of studies, provides an explanation for the quantitative and (perhaps) qualitative components (e.g., data collection, analysis, interpretation) of a study, and informs the findings and results. A participatory&ndash;social justice theory in mixed methods is a framework that has emerged in recent years. It is a lens for looking at a problem recognizing the non-neutrality of knowledge, the pervasive influence of human interests, and issues such as power and social relationships. A mixed methods study helps to improve people and society. Groups often helped by this research are feminists; diverse ethnic/racial groups; people with disabilities; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and queer communities. Mixed methods researchers incorporate this framework into multiple stages of the research process, such as the introduction, the research questions, the data collection, and an interpretation that calls for change. Criteria have been developed for how to incorporate a participatory&ndash;social justice framework into a mixed methods study.</span><a id="calibre_link-261"></a></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><blockquote id="calibre_link-84" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Writing Exercises</span></span></blockquote><div class="calibre_38">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Write a theoretical perspective section for your research plan following the script for a quantitative theory discussion presented in this chapter.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">For a quantitative proposal you are planning, draw a visual model of the variables in the theory using the procedures for causal model design advanced in this chapter.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Locate qualitative journal articles that (a) use an a priori theory that is modified during the process of research, (b) generate or develop a theory at the end of the study, and (c) represent descriptive research without the use of an explicit theoretical model.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Locate a mixed methods study that uses a theoretical lens, such as a feminist, ethnic/racial, or class perspective.

The inclusion of validating findings, ethical considerations (to be addressed shortly), the need for preliminary results, and early evidence of practical significance focus a reader’s attention on key elements often overlooked in discussions about proposed projects.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Format for a Qualitative Proposal</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Beyond these nine questions, it is also helpful to have an overall outline or general structure for topics that will be included in a proposal for a study. Unquestionably, in qualitative research, no one structure for a qualitative proposal prevails. We do think, however, that a couple of general outlines would be helpful, especially for the student who has never written a thesis or dissertation project. Here we propose two alternative models. <a href="#calibre_link-89">Example 4.1</a> is drawn from a constructivist/interpretivist perspective whereas <a href="#calibre_link-90">Example 4.2</a> is based more on a participatory&ndash;social justice model of qualitative research.</p><blockquote id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">Example 4.1 A Qualitative Constructivist/Interpretivist Format</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Introduction</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Statement of the problem (including existing literature about the problem, deficiencies in the literature, and relevance of study for audiences)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Purpose of the study</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">The research questions</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Procedures</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Philosophical assumptions or worldview of qualitative research</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Qualitative design (e.g., ethnography, case study)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Role of the researcher</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Data collection procedures</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Data analysis procedures</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Strategies for validating findings</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Proposed narrative structure of the study</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Anticipated ethical issues</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Preliminary pilot findings (if available)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Expected impact and significance of study</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">References</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Appendixes: Interview questions, observational forms, timeline, proposed budget, a summary of the proposed content of each chapter in the final study</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_3">In this example, the writer includes introduction, procedures, ethical issues, preliminary findings and expected impact of the study.

Several appendixes may seem unusual. Developing a timeline for the study and presenting a proposed budget provide useful information to committees, although these sections would be highly recommended, but optional in proposals.

All of these parts could make the mixed methods proposal lengthier than either the qualitative or quantitative proposal.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Designing the Sections of a Proposal</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Here are several <span class="bold">research tips</span> that we give to students about designing the overall structure of a proposal:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Specify the sections early in the design of a proposal. Work on one section will often prompt ideas for other sections. First develop an outline, and then write something for each section rapidly to get ideas down on paper. Then refine the sections as you consider in more detail the information that should go into each one.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Find proposals that other students have authored under your adviser, and look at them closely. Ask your adviser for copies of proposals that he or she especially liked and felt were scholarly products to take to committees. Study the topics addressed and their order as well as the level of detail used in composing the proposal.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Determine whether your program or institution offers a course on proposal development or some similar topic. Often such a class will be helpful as a support system for your project as well as providing individuals that can react to your proposal ideas as they develop.</li><a id="calibre_link-265"></a><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Sit down with your adviser, and go over his or her preferred format for a proposal. Ask this adviser for a copy of a proposal that might serve as a guide. Be cautious about using published journal articles as a model for the proposal: they may not provide the information desired by your adviser or graduate committee.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Writing Ideas</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Over the years, John has collected books on how to write, and he typically is reading a new one during production of his research projects. In more recent years, he has bought fewer and fewer books about writing per se and instead has purchased good novels and nonfiction works from which to draw thoughts about writing tips. He routinely reads books on the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> top 10 list and popular books of fiction and nonfiction (for fiction, see Harding, 2009). He brings into his research methods classes segments from books to share to illustrate writing points. This is not to impress others with his literary acumen, but to encourage researchers, as writers, to reach out to their audience; to not wax eloquently in words, but to be concise, and to-the-point; and to practice writing rather than simply talk about it. This chapter, then, represents a collage of John’s favorite books on writing and the tips both of us have found useful for our scholarship writing.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Writing as Thinking</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">One sign of inexperienced writers is that they prefer to discuss their proposed study rather than write about it. As Stephen King (2000) recommended, it is helpful to write it out quickly as rough as it may be in the first rendering. We recommend the following:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Early in the process of research, write ideas down rather than talk about them</span>. One author has talked directly about this concept of writing as thinking (Bailey, 1984). Zinsser (1983) also discussed the need to get words out of our heads and onto paper. Advisers react better when they read the ideas on paper than when they hear and discuss a research topic with a student or colleague. When a researcher renders ideas on paper, a reader can visualize the final product, actually see how it looks, and begin to clarify ideas. The concept of working ideas out on paper has served many experienced writers well. Before designing a proposal, draft a one- to two-page overview of your project and have your adviser approve the direction of your proposed study. This draft might contain the essential information: the research problem being addressed, the purpose of the study, the central questions being asked, the source of data, and the significance of the project for different audiences. It might also be useful to draft several one- to two-page statements on different topics and see which one your adviser likes best and feels would make the best contribution to your field.</li><a id="calibre_link-283"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Work through several drafts of a proposal rather than trying to polish the first draft</span>. It is illuminating to see how people think on paper. Zinsser (1983) identified two types of writers: (a) the “bricklayer,” who makes every paragraph just right before going on to the next paragraph, and (b) the “let-it-all-hang-out-on-the-first-draft” writer, who writes an entire first draft not caring how sloppy it looks or how badly it is written. In between would be someone like Peter Elbow (1973), who recommended that one should go through the iterative process of writing, reviewing, and rewriting. He cited this exercise: With only 1 hour to write a passage, write four drafts (one every 15 minutes) rather than one draft (typically in the last 15 minutes) during the hour. Most experienced researchers write the first draft carefully but do not work for a polished draft; the polish comes relatively late in the writing process.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Do not edit your proposal at the early-draft stage</span>. Instead, consider Franklin’s (1986) three-stage model, which we have found useful in developing proposals and in our scholarly writing: <ol class="calibre_17"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">First, develop an outline; it could be a sentence or word outline or a visual map.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Write out a draft and then shift and sort ideas, moving around entire paragraphs in the manuscript.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Finally, edit and polish each sentence.</li></ol></li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Habit of Writing</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Establish the discipline or <span class="bold">habit of writing</span> in a regular and continuous way on your proposal. Although setting aside a completed draft of the proposal for a time may provide some perspective to review your work before final polishing. A start-and-stop process of writing often disrupts the flow of work. It may turn a well-meaning researcher into what we call a “weekend writer,” an individual who has time for working on research only on weekends after all the <span class="italic">important</span> work of the week has been accomplished. Continual work on the proposal is writing something each day or at least being engaged daily in the processes of thinking, collecting information, and reviewing that goes into manuscript and proposal production. We do feel that some people have a stronger urge to write than others. Perhaps this comes from a need to express oneself or a comfort level with self-expression or simply with training.</p><p class="calibre_">Select a time of day to work that is best for you, and then discipline yourself to write at this time each day. Choose a place free of distractions. Boice (1990, pp. 77&ndash;78) offered ideas about establishing good writing habits:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">With the aid of the priority principle, make writing a daily activity, regardless of mood, regardless of readiness to write.</li><a id="calibre_link-284"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16">If you feel you do not have time for regular writing, begin by charting your daily activities for a week or two in half-hour blocks. It is likely you’ll find a time to write.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Write while you are fresh.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Avoid writing in binges.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Write in small, regular amounts.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">Schedule writing tasks so that you plan to work on specific, manageable units of writing in each session.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">Keep daily charts. Graph at least three things: (a) time spent writing, (b) page equivalents finished, and (c) percentage of planned task completed.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">Plan beyond daily goals.</li><li value="9" class="calibre_16">Share your writing with supportive, constructive friends until you feel ready to go public.</li><li value="10" class="calibre_16">Try to work on two or three writing projects concurrently so that you do not become overloaded with any one project.</li></ul><p class="calibre_">It is also important to acknowledge that writing moves along slowly and that a writer must ease into the process. Like the runner who stretches before a road race, the writer needs warm-up exercises for both the mind and the fingers. We are reminded of the piano player who engages in finger-stretching exercises before practicing a difficult piece that will put the hands into difficult positions. For your research, some leisurely writing activity, such as writing a letter to a friend, brainstorming on the computer, reading some good writing, or studying a favorite poem, can make the actual task of writing easier. We are reminded of John Steinbeck’s (1969) “warm-up period” (p. 42) described in detail in <span class="italic">Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters.</span> Steinbeck began each writing day by writing a letter to his editor and close friend, Pascal Covici, in a large notebook supplied by Covici.</p><p class="calibre_">Other exercises may prove useful as warm-ups. Carroll (1990) provided examples of exercises to improve a writer’s control over descriptive and emotive passages:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Describe an object by its parts and dimensions, without first telling the reader its name.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Write a conversation between two people on any dramatic or intriguing subject.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Write a set of directions for a complicated task.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Take a subject and write about it three different ways. (pp. 113&ndash;116)</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-251" class="calibre_">This last exercise seems appropriate for qualitative researchers who analyze their data for multiple codes and themes (see <a href="#calibre_link-16">Chapter 9</a> for qualitative data analysis).</p><p class="calibre_">Consider also the writing implements and the physical location that aid the process of disciplined writing. The implements&mdash;an online dictionary and a thesaurus, a tablet for jotting down thoughts, a cup of coffee, and a handful of Triscuits (Wolcott, 2009)&mdash;offer the writer options for ways to be comfortable when writing. The physical setting can also help. Annie Dillard (1989), the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winning novelist, avoided appealing workplaces:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">One wants a room with no view, so imagination can meet memory in the dark. When I furnished this study seven years ago, I pushed the long desk against a blank wall, so I could not see from either window. Once, fifteen years ago, I wrote in a cinder-block cell over a parking lot. It overlooked a tar-and-gravel roof. This pine shed under trees is not quite so good as the cinder-block study was, but it will do. (pp. 26&ndash;27)</blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Readability of the Manuscript</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Before beginning the writing of a proposal, consider how you will enhance the readability of it for other people. The <span class="italic">Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</span> (American Psychological Association [APA], 2010) discusses an orderly presentation by showing the relationships between ideas and through the use of transitional words. In addition, it is important to use consistent terms, a staging and foreshadowing of ideas, and coherence built into the plan.</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Use <span class="italic">consistent terms</span> throughout the proposal. Use the same term for each variable in a quantitative study and the same central phenomenon in a qualitative study. Refrain from using synonyms for these terms, a problem that causes the reader to work at understanding the meaning of ideas and to monitor subtle shifts in meaning. When terms shift, ever so slightly, it throws the reader off and causes them to question your ideas.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Consider how narrative thoughts of different types guide a reader. Tarshis (1982) advanced the idea that writers should have in mind the purpose of different-sized narrative thoughts and purposes for segments of text. He said there were four types: <ol class="calibre_17"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Umbrella thoughts: the general or core ideas one is trying to get across</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Big thoughts in writing</span>: specific ideas or images that fall within the realm of umbrella thoughts and serve to reinforce, clarify, or elaborate upon the umbrella thoughts</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Little thoughts: ideas or images whose chief function is to reinforce big thoughts</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Attention or interest thoughts</span>: ideas whose purposes are to keep the reader on track, organize ideas, and keep an individual’s attention</li></ol></li><a id="calibre_link-358"></a></ul><p class="calibre_">Beginning researchers seem to struggle most with umbrella and attention thoughts. A proposal may include too many umbrella ideas&mdash;with the content not sufficiently detailed to support large ideas. This might occur in a literature review in which the researcher needs to provide fewer small sections and more larger sections that tie together large bodies of literature. A clear mark of this problem is a continual shift of ideas from one major idea to another in a manuscript. Often, one will see short paragraphs in introductions to proposals, like those written by journalists in newspaper articles. Thinking in terms of a detailed narrative to support umbrella ideas may help this problem.</p><p class="calibre_">Attention thoughts&mdash;those that provide organizational statements to guide the reader&mdash;are also needed. Readers need road signs to guide them from one major idea to the next (<a href="#calibre_link-13">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="#calibre_link-14">7</a> of this book discuss major road signs in research, such as purpose statements and research questions and hypotheses). An organizing paragraph is often useful at the beginning and end of literature reviews. Readers need to see the overall organization of the ideas through introductory paragraphs and to be told the most salient points they should remember in a summary.</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Use <span class="italic">coherence</span> to add to the readability of the manuscript. <span class="bold">Coherence in writing</span> means that the ideas tie together and logically flow from one sentence to another and from one paragraph to another. For example, the repetition of the same variable names in the title, the purpose statement, the research questions, and the review of the literature headings in a quantitative project illustrate this thinking. This approach builds coherence into the study. Emphasizing a consistent order whenever independent and dependent variables are mentioned also reinforces this idea.</li></ul><p class="calibre_">On a more detailed level, coherence builds through connecting sentences and paragraphs in the manuscript. Zinsser (1983) suggested that every sentence should be a logical sequel to the one that preceded it. The hook-and-eye exercise (Wilkinson, 1991) is useful for connecting thoughts from sentence to sentence and paragraph to paragraph. The basic idea here is that one sentence builds on the next and sentences in a paragraph build into the next paragraph. The way this occurs is by specific words that provide a linkage.</p><p class="calibre_">The passage in <a href="#calibre_link-100">Example 4.5</a>, from a draft of a student’s proposal, shows a high level of coherence. It comes from the introductory section of a qualitative dissertation project about at-risk students. In this passage, we have taken the liberty of drawing hooks and eyes to connect the words from sentence to another sentence and from paragraph to paragraph. As mentioned, the objective of the hook-and-eye exercise (Wilkinson, 1991) is to connect major thoughts (and words) of each sentence and paragraph. If such a connection cannot easily be made, the written passage lacks coherence; the ideas and topics shift; and the reader needs to add transitional words, phrases, or <a id="calibre_link-394"></a>sentences to establish a clear connection. The reader also does not get a sense of how the ideas build in a study.</p><p class="calibre_">In John’s proposal development classes, he has provided a passage from an introduction to a proposal and asks students to connect the words and sentences using circles for key ideas and lines to connect these key words from sentence to sentence. It is important for a reader to find coherence in a proposal starting with the first page. He first gives his students an unmarked passage and then, after the exercise, provides a marked passage. Since the key idea of one sentence should connect to a key idea in the next sentence, they need to mark this relationship in the passage. If the sentences do not connect, then transition words are missing that need to be inserted. He also asks students to make sure that the paragraphs are connected with hooks and eyes as well as individual sentences.</p><blockquote id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">Example 4.5 An Illustration of the Hook-and-Eye Technique</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23"><img src="images/000024.jpg" class="calibre_51" /></blockquote><p id="calibre_link-101" class="calibre_20">

Similar grammar and sentence construction issues are addressed in the APA <span class="italic">Publication Manual</span> (APA, 2010), but we include this section to highlight some common grammar issues that we have seen in student proposals and in my own writing.</p><p class="calibre_">Our thoughts are directed toward the “polish” level of writing, to use Franklin’s (1986) term. It is a stage addressed late in the writing process. One can find an abundance of writing books about research writing and literary writing with rules and principles to follow concerning good sentence construction and word choice. Wolcott (2009), a qualitative ethnographer, for example, talks about honing editorial skills to eliminate unnecessary words (keeping the essential words); deleting the passive voice (using the active voice); scaling down qualifiers (keeping only one qualifier at best); eliminating overused phrases (completing striking these out); and reducing excessive quotations, use of italics, and parenthetical comments (all elements of good scholarly writing). <a id="calibre_link-252"></a>The following additional ideas about active voice, verb tense, and reduced <span class="bold">fat</span> can strengthen and invigorate scholarly writing for dissertation and thesis proposals.</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Use the <span class="italic">active voice</span> as much as possible in scholarly writing (APA, 2010). According to the literary writer Ross-Larson (1982), “If the subject acts, the voice is active. If the subject is acted on, the voice is passive” (p. 29). In addition, a sign of passive construction is some variation of an auxiliary verb, such as <span class="italic">was</span>. Examples include <span class="italic">will be, have been</span>, and <span class="italic">is being</span>. Writers can use the passive construction when the person acting can logically be left out of the sentence and when what is acted on is the subject of the rest of the paragraph (Ross-Larson, 1982).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Use <span class="italic">strong active verbs</span> appropriate for the passage. Lazy verbs are those that lack action, commonly called “to be” verbs, such as <span class="italic">is</span> or <span class="italic">was</span>, or verbs turned into adjectives or adverbs.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Pay close attention to the <span class="italic">tense</span> of your verbs. A common practice exists in using the past tense to review the literature and report results of past studies. The past tense represents a commonly used form in quantitative research. The future tense appropriately indicates that the study will be conducted in the future, a key verb-use for proposals. Use the present tense to add vigor to a study, especially in the introduction, as this tense-form frequently occurs in qualitative studies. In mixed methods studies, researchers employ either the present or past tense and the appropriate tense often reflects whether the major orientation of the study will be quantitative or qualitative research (thus emphasizing one or the other in a study). The APA <span class="italic">Publication Manual</span> (APA, 2010) recommends the past tense (e.g., “Jones reported”) or the present perfect tense (e.g., “Researchers have reported”) for the literature review and procedures based on past events, the past tense to describe results (e.g., “stress lowered self-esteem”), and the present tense (e.g., “the qualitative findings show”) to discuss the results and to present the conclusions. We see this not as a hard and fast rule but as a useful guideline.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Expect to edit and revise drafts of a manuscript to trim the fat. Fat refers to additional words that are unnecessary to convey the meaning of ideas and need to be edited out. Writing multiple drafts of a manuscript is standard practice for most writers. The process typically consists of writing, reviewing, and editing. In the editing process, trim excess words from sentences, such as piled-up modifiers, excessive prepositions, and “the-of” constructions&mdash;for example, “the study of”&mdash;that add unnecessary verbiage (Ross-Larson, 1982). We were reminded of the unnecessary prose that comes into writing by the example mentioned by Bunge (1985): <blockquote class="calibre_32">Nowadays you can almost see bright people struggling to reinvent the complex sentence before your eyes. A friend of mine who is a college administrator every now and then has to say a complex sentence, and he will get into one of those morasses that begins, “I would hope that we would be able . . .” He never talked that way when I first met him, but even at his age, at his distance from the crisis in the lives of younger people, he’s been to some extent alienated from easy speech. (p. 172)</blockquote></li></ul><p id="calibre_link-273" class="calibre_3">Begin studying good writing about research using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods designs. In good writing, the eye does not pause and the mind does not stumble on a passage. In this present book, we have attempted to draw examples of good research from human and social science journals, such as <span class="italic">Administrative Science Quarterly, American Educational Research Journal, American Journal of Sociology, Image, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Mixed Methods Research, Journal of Nursing Scholarship,</span> and <span class="italic">Sociology of Education.</span> In the qualitative area, good literature serves to illustrate clear prose and detailed passages. Individuals who teach qualitative research assign well-known books from literature, such as <span class="italic">Moby Dick, The Scarlet Letter,</span> and <span class="italic">The Bonfire of the Vanities,</span> as reading assignments (Webb &amp; Glesne, 1992). <span class="italic">Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, Qualitative Family Research, Qualitative Health Research, Qualitative Inquiry,</span> and <span class="italic">Qualitative Research</span> represent good, scholarly journals in qualitative research to examine. When using mixed methods research, examine journals that report studies with combined qualitative and quantitative research and data, including many social science journals, such as the <span class="italic">Journal of Mixed Methods Research, The International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches, Field Methods, Quality and Quantity,</span> and the <span class="italic">International Journal of Social Research Methodology.</span> Examine the numerous articles cited in the <span class="italic">SAGE Handbook of Mixed Methods in Social and Behavioral Research</span> (Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2010) and in <span class="italic">The Mixed Methods Reader</span> (Plano Clark &amp; Creswell, 2008).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Ethical Issues to Anticipate</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In addition to conceptualizing the writing process for a proposal, researchers need to anticipate the ethical issues that may arise during their studies (Berg, 2001; Hesse-Biber &amp; Leavy, 2011; Punch, 2005; Sieber, 1998). Research involves collecting data from people, about people (Punch, 2014). Writing about these anticipated ethical issues is required in making an argument for a study as well as being an important topic in the format for proposals. Researchers need to protect their research participants; develop a trust with them; promote the integrity of research; guard against misconduct and impropriety that might reflect on their organizations or institutions; and cope with new, challenging problems (Israel &amp; Hay, 2006). Ethical questions are apparent today in such issues as personal disclosure, authenticity, and credibility of the research report; the role of researchers in cross-cultural contexts; and issues of personal privacy through forms of Internet data collection (Israel &amp; Hay, 2006).</p><blockquote id="calibre_link-228" class="calibre_28">

The ethical considerations that need to be anticipated are extensive, and they are reflected through the research process. These issues apply to qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research and to all stages of research. Proposal writers need to anticipate them and actively address them in their research plans. Accordingly, it is helpful to address them as they relate to different phases of inquiry. As shown in <a href="#calibre_link-228">Table 4.1</a>, attention needs to be directed toward ethical issues prior to conducting the study; beginning a study; during data collection and data analysis; and in reporting, sharing, and storing the data.</p><p id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre_1">

In the literature, ethical issues arise in discussions about codes of professional conduct for researchers and in commentaries about ethical dilemmas and their potential solutions (Punch, 2014). Many national professional associations have published standards or codes of ethics on their websites. For example, see the following websites: <ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">The American Psychological Association Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, Including 2010 Amendments (<a href="http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx">www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx</a>)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">The American Sociological Association Code of Ethics, adopted in 1997 (<a href="http://www.asanet.org/membership/code-ethics">www.asanet.org/membership/code-ethics</a>)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">The American Anthropological Association’s Code of Ethics, February 2009 (ethics.americananthro.org/category/statement/)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">The American Educational Research Association Ethical Standards of the American Educational Research Association, 2011 (<a href="http://www.aera.net/AboutAERA/AERA-Rules-Policies/Professional-Ethics">www.aera.net/AboutAERA/AERA-Rules-Policies/Professional-Ethics</a>)</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">The American Nurses Association Code of Ethics for Nurses&mdash;Provisions, approved in June 2001 (<a href="http://www.nursingworld.org/codeofethics">www.nursingworld.org/codeofethics</a>)</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">The American Medical Association Code of Ethics (<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ama-code-medicalethics">www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ama-code-medicalethics</a>)</li></ul></li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Apply to the institutional review board.</span> Researchers need to have their research plans reviewed by an <span class="bold">institutional review board (IRB)</span> on their college and university campuses. IRB committees exist on campuses because of federal regulations that provide protection against human rights violations. The IRB committee requires the researcher to assess the potential for risk to participants in a study, such as physical, psychological, social, economic, or legal harm (Sieber, 1998). Also, the researcher needs to consider the special needs of vulnerable populations, such as minors (under the age of 19), mentally incompetent participants, victims, persons with neurological impairments, pregnant women or fetuses, prisoners, and individuals with AIDS. As a researcher, you will need to file an application with the IRB that contains procedures and information about participants so that the committee can review the extent to which you place participants at risk in your study. In addition to this application, you need to have participants sign <span class="bold">informed consent forms</span> agreeing to the provisions of your study before they provide data. This form contains a standard set of elements that acknowledges protection of human rights. They include the following (Sarantakos, 2005): <ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Identification of the researcher</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Identification of the sponsoring institution</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Identification of the purpose of the study</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Identification of the benefits for participating</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Identification of the level and type of participant involvement</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">Notation of risks to the participant</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">Guarantee of confidentiality to the participant</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">Assurance that the participant can withdraw at any time</li><li value="9" class="calibre_16">Provision of names of persons to contact if questions arise</li></ul></li><a id="calibre_link-336"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Obtain necessary permissions.</span> Prior to the study, researchers need to obtain approval of individuals in authority (e.g., gatekeepers) to gain access to sites and to study participants. This often involves writing a letter that specifies the extent of time, the potential impact, and the outcomes of the research. Use of Internet responses gained through electronic interviews or surveys needs permission from participants. This can be obtained through first obtaining permission and then sending out the interview or survey.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Select a site without vested interests.</span> Selecting a site to study in which you have an interest in outcomes is not a good idea. It does not allow for the objectivity required for quantitative research or for the full expression of multiple perspectives needed in qualitative research. Select sites that will now raise these questions of power and influence in your study.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Negotiate authorship for publication.</span> If you plan to publish your study (often the case for a dissertation project), an important issue to negotiate before beginning the study is the question of authorship for individuals who contribute to the study. Order of authorship is important to state at the beginning so that individuals who contribute to a research study receive their due contribution. Israel and Hay (2006) discussed the unethical practice of so-called “gift authorship” to individuals who do not contribute to a manuscript and ghost authorship, in which junior staff who made significant contributions have been omitted from the list of authors. The inclusion of authors and the order of authorship may change during a study, but a preliminary understanding early in the project helps address this issue when publication is imminent.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-104" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Beginning the Study</span></span></p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Identify a beneficial research problem.</span> During the identification of the research problem, it is important to identify a problem that will benefit individuals being studied, one that will be meaningful for others besides the researcher (Punch, 2014). Hesse-Biber and Leavy (2011) asked, “How do ethical issues enter into your selection of a research problem?” (p. 86). To guard against this, proposal developers can conduct pilot projects, needs assessments, or hold informal conversations to establish trust and respect with the participants so that inquirers can detect any potential marginalization of participants as the study begins.</li><a id="calibre_link-301"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Disclose purpose of the study.</span> In developing the purpose statement or the central intent and questions for a study, proposal developers need to convey the purpose of the study that will be described to the participants (Sarantakos, 2005). Deception occurs when participants understand one purpose but the researcher has a different purpose in mind. It is also important for researchers to specify the sponsorship of their study. For example, in designing cover letters for survey research, sponsorship is an important element in establishing trust and credibility for a mailed survey instrument.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Do not pressure participants into signing consent forms.</span> When collecting consent for a study, the researcher should not force participants to sign the informed consent form. Participation in a study should be seen as voluntary, and the researcher should explain in the instructions for the consent form that participants can decide not to participate in the study.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Respect norms and charters of indigenous cultures.</span> The researcher needs to anticipate any cultural, religious, gender, or other differences in the participants and sites that need to be respected. Recent discussions about the norms and charters of indigenous populations, such as American Indian tribes, need to be observed (LaFrance &amp; Crazy Bull, 2009). As American Indian tribes take over the delivery of services to members, they have reclaimed their right to determine what research will be done and how it will be reported in a sensitive way to tribal culture and charters.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Collecting the Data</span></span></p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Respect the site, and disrupt as little as possible</span>. Researchers need to respect research sites so that they are left undisturbed after a research study. This requires that inquirers, especially in qualitative studies involving prolonged observation or interviewing at a site, be cognizant of their impact and minimize their disruption of the physical setting. For example, they might time visits so that they intrude little on the flow of activities of participants. Also, organizations often have guidelines that provide guidance for conducting research without disturbing their settings.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Make sure that all participants receive the benefits.</span> In experimental studies, investigators need to collect data so that all participants, not only an experimental group, benefit from the treatments. This may require providing <span class="italic">some</span> treatment to all groups or staging the treatment so that ultimately all groups receive the beneficial treatment (e.g., a wait list). Further, both the researcher and the participants should benefit from the research. In some situations, power can easily be abused and participants can be coerced into a project. Involving individuals collaboratively in the research may provide reciprocity. Highly collaborative studies, popular in qualitative research, may engage participants as coresearchers throughout the research process, such as the design, data collection and analysis, report writing, and dissemination of the findings (Patton, 2002).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Avoid deceiving participants.</span> Participants need to know that they are actively participating in a research study. To counteract this problem, provide instructions that remind the participants about the purpose of the study.</li><a id="calibre_link-348"></a><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Respect potential power imbalances</span>. Interviewing in qualitative research is increasingly being seen as a moral inquiry (Kvale, 2007). It could equally be seen as such for quantitative and mixed methods research. As such, interviewers need to consider how the interview will improve the human situation (as well as enhance scientific knowledge), how a sensitive interview interaction may be stressful for the participants, whether participants have a say in how their statements are interpreted, how critically the interviewees might be questioned, and what the consequences of the interview for the interviewees and the groups to which they belong might be. Interviews (and observations) should begin from the premise that a power imbalance exists between the data collector and the participants.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Avoid exploitation of participants.</span> There needs to be some reciprocity back to the participants for their involvement in your study. This might be a small reward for participating, sharing the final research report, or involving them as collaborators. Traditionally, some researchers have “used” the participants for data collection and then abruptly left the scene. This results in exploitation of the participants and rewards and appreciation can provide respect and reciprocity for those who provide value data in a study.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Avoid collecting harmful information.</span> Researchers also need to anticipate the possibility of harmful, intimate information being disclosed during the data collection process. It is difficult to anticipate and try to plan for the impact of this information during or after an interview (Patton, 2002). For example, a student may discuss parental abuse or prisoners may talk about an escape. Typically in these situations, the ethical code for researchers (which may be different for schools and prisons) is to protect the privacy of the participants and to convey this protection to all individuals involved in a study.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Analyzing the Data</span></span></p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Avoid going native.</span> It is easy to support and embrace the perspectives of participants in a study. In qualitative studies, this means “taking sides” and only discussing the results that place the participants in a favorable light. In quantitative research, it means disregarding data that proves or disproves personal hypotheses that the researcher may hold.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Avoid disclosing only positive results.</span> In research, it is academically dishonest to withhold important results or to cast the results in a favorable light to the participants’ or researchers’ inclinations. In qualitative research, this means that the inquirer needs to report the full range of findings, including findings that may be contrary to the themes. A hallmark of good qualitative research is the report of the diversity of perspectives about the topic. In quantitative research, the data analysis should reflect the statistical tests and not be underreported.</li><a id="calibre_link-254"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Respect the privacy of participants.</span> How will the study protect the anonymity of individuals, roles, and incidents in the project? For example, in survey research, investigators disassociate names from responses during the coding and recording process. In qualitative research, inquirers use aliases or pseudonyms for individuals and places, to protect the identities of participants.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-107" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Reporting, Sharing, and Storing Data</span></span></p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Falsifying authorship, evidence, data, findings, or conclusions.</span> In the interpretation of data, researchers need to provide an accurate account of the information. This accuracy may require debriefing between the researcher and participants in quantitative research (Berg, 2001). It may include, in qualitative research, using one or more of the strategies to check the accuracy of the data with participants or across different data sources, through strategies of validation. Other ethical issues in reporting the research will involve the potential of suppressing, falsifying, or inventing findings to meet a researcher’s or an audience’s needs. These fraudulent practices are not accepted in professional research communities, and they constitute scientific misconduct (Neuman, 2009). A proposal might contain a proactive stance by the researcher to not engage in these practices.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Do not plagiarize.</span> Copying extensive material from others is an ethical issue. Researchers should give credit for the work of others and quotation marks should indicate the exact words claimed from others. The key idea is to not present the work of another as your own (APA, 2010). Even when material is paraphrased, credit must be given to the original source. Journals typically have guidelines about how much material can be quoted from another source without the author having to pay a permission fee for the use of the material.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Avoid disclosing information that would harm participants.</span> One issue to anticipate about confidentiality is that some participants may not want to have their identity remain confidential. By permitting this, the researcher allows the participants to retain ownership of their voices and exert their independence in making decisions. They do, however, need to be well informed about the possible risks of non-confidentiality, such as the inclusion of data in the final report that they may not have expected, information that infringes on the rights of others that should remain concealed, and so forth (Giordano, O’Reilly, Taylor, &amp; Dogra, 2007). In planning a study, it is important to anticipate the repercussions of conducting the research on certain audiences and not to misuse the results to the advantage of one group or another.</li><a id="calibre_link-255"></a><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Communicate in clear straightforward, appropriate language.</span> Discuss how the research will not use language or words that are biased against persons because of gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic group, disability, or age. Review the three guidelines for biased language in the APA <span class="italic">Publication Manual</span> (APA, 2010). Present unbiased language at an appropriate level of specificity (e.g., rather than say, “The client’s behavior was typically male,” state, “The client’s behavior was _____________ [specify]”). Use language that is sensitive to labels (e.g., rather than “400 Hispanics,” indicate “400 Mexicans, Spaniards, and Puerto Ricans”). Acknowledge participants in a study (e.g., rather than “subject,” use the word <span class="italic">participant,</span> and rather than “woman doctor” use “doctor” or “physician”).</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Share data with others.</span> It is important to release the details of the research with the study design so that readers can determine for themselves the credibility of the study (Neuman, 2009). Detailed procedures for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research will be emphasized in the chapters to follow. Some strategies for sharing include providing copies of reports to participants and stakeholders, making distributions of reports available on websites, and publishing studies in multiple languages when needed.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Keep raw data and other materials (e.g., details of procedures, instruments).</span> Data, once analyzed, need to be kept for a reasonable period of time (e.g., Sieber, 1998, recommends 5 to 10 years; the APA, 5 years). After this period, investigators should discard the data so that it does not fall into the hands of other researchers who might misappropriate it.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Do not duplicate or piecemeal publications.</span> Also, researchers should not engage in duplicate or redundant publication in which authors publish papers that present exactly the same data, discussions, and conclusions and do not offer new material. Some biomedical journals now require authors to declare whether they have published or are preparing to publish papers that are closely related to the manuscript that has been submitted (Israel &amp; Hay, 2006).</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Complete proof of compliance with ethical issues and a lack of conflict of interest.</span> Some academic campuses now require authors to file statements indicating that they do not have a conflict of interest in publishing the research. Such conflict might arise from payment for their research, a vested interest in the outcome of the data, or the intent to appropriate the use of the research for personal reasons. As a researcher, you need to comply with requests for disclosure about potential conflicts of interests that surround your research.</li><li value="9" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Understand who owns the data.</span> The question of who owns the data once it is collected and analyzed also can be an issue that splits research teams and divides individuals against each other. A proposal might mention this issue of ownership and discuss how it will be resolved, such as through the development of a clear understanding between the researcher, the participants, and possibly the faculty advisers (Punch, 2014). Berg (2001) recommended the use of personal agreements to designate ownership of research data.</li><a id="calibre_link-274"></a></ul><blockquote id="calibre_link-108" class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">Summary</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">It is helpful to consider how to write a research proposal before actually engaging in the process.

A process of organizing and writing out ideas begins, starting with designing an introduction to a proposal. This chapter discusses the composition and writing of a scholarly introduction and examines the differences in writing an introduction for these three different types of designs. Then the discussion turns to the five components of writing a good introduction: (a) establishing the problem leading to the study, (b) reviewing the literature about the problem, (c) identifying deficiencies in the literature about the problem, (d) targeting an audience and noting the significance of the problem for this audience, and (e) identifying the purpose of the proposed study. These components comprise a <span class="italic">social science deficiency model</span> of writing an introduction, because a major component of the introduction is to set forth the deficiencies in past research. To illustrate this model, a complete introduction in a published research study is presented and analyzed.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-111" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">The Importance of Introductions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">An introduction is the first passage in a journal article, dissertation, or scholarly research study. It sets the stage for the entire project. Wilkinson (1991) mentioned the following:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">The introduction is the part of the paper that provides readers with the background information for the research reported in the paper. Its purpose is to establish a framework for the research, so that readers can understand how it is related to other research. (p. 96)</blockquote><p class="calibre_3">The introduction establishes the issue or concern leading to the research by conveying information about a problem. Because it is the initial passage in a study or proposal, special care must be given to writing it. The introduction needs to create reader interest in the topic, establish the problem that leads to the study, place the study within the larger context of the scholarly literature, and reach out to a specific audience. All of this is achieved in a concise section of a few pages. Because of the messages they must convey and the limited space allowed, introductions are challenging to write and understand.</p><p class="calibre_">A research problem is the problem or issue that leads to the need for a study. It can originate from many potential sources. It might spring from an <a id="calibre_link-256"></a>experience researchers have had in their personal lives or workplaces. It may come from an extensive debate that has appeared in the literature. The literature may have a gap that needs to be addressed, alternative views that should be resolved, or a branch that needs to be studied. Further, the research problem might develop from policy debates in government or among top executives. The sources of research problems are often multiple. Identifying and stating the research problem that underlies a study is not easy. For example, to identify the issue of teenage pregnancy is to point to a problem for women and for society at large. Unfortunately, too many authors do not clearly identify the research problem, leaving readers to decide for themselves the importance of the issue. When the problem is not clear, it is difficult to understand all the other aspects of a research study, especially the significance of the research. Furthermore, the research problem is often confused with the research questions&mdash;those questions that the investigator would like answered in order to understand or explain the problem. To this complexity is added the need for introductions to carry the weight of encouraging the reader to read further and to see significance in the study.</p><p class="calibre_">Fortunately, there is a model for writing a good, scholarly social science introduction. Before introducing this model, it is necessary to briefly discuss the composition of a good abstract and then to distinguish subtle differences between introductions for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-112" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">An Abstract for a Study</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">An abstract is a brief summary of the contents of a study, and it allows readers to quickly survey the essential elements of a project. It is placed at the beginning of studies, and it is useful to have both for proposals for studies and for the final thesis or dissertation. The <span class="italic">Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</span> (American Psychological Association [APA], 2010) indicates that the abstract can be the most important single paragraph in a study. It also needs to be accurate, non-evaluative (by adding comments beyond the scope of the research), coherent, readable, and concise. Its length varies, and some colleges and universities have requirements for an appropriate length (e.g., 250 words). The APA <span class="italic">Publication Manual</span> (APA, 2010) guidelines say that most abstracts are from 150 to 250 words.</p><p class="calibre_">There are the major components that we would include in an abstract. The content varies for abstracts for a report, a literature review, a theory-oriented paper, and for a methodological paper. We will focus here on the abstract for a proposal for an empirical article. We see several major components as part of the abstract, and these would be the same whether the proposal is quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods. Also, we would order these components in the order in which they can be presented:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Start with the <span class="italic">issue</span> or <span class="italic">problem</span> leading to a need for the research. This issue might be related to a need for more literature, but we like to think about a real-life problem that needs to be addressed, such as the spread of AIDS, teenage pregnancies, college students dropping out of school, or the lack of women in certain professions. These are all real-life problems that need to be addressed. The problem could also indicate a deficiency in the literature, such as a gap, a need to extend a topic, or to resolve differences among research studies. You could cite a reference or two about this “problem,” but generally the abstract is too short to include many references.</li><a id="calibre_link-362"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Indicate the <span class="italic">purpose of the study</span>. Use the word <span class="italic">purpose</span> or the term <span class="italic">study aim</span> or <span class="italic">objective,</span> and talk about the central phenomenon being explored, the participants who will be studied, and the site where the research will take place.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Next state what <span class="italic">data will be collected</span> to address this purpose. You might indicate the type of data, the participants, and where the data will be collected.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">After this, indicate qualitative <span class="italic">themes</span>, quantitative <span class="italic">statistical results,</span> or the mixed methods integrative findings that will likely arise in your study. At the early stages of planning a project, you will not know what these results will be, so you might have to guess as to what they might be. Indicate four to five themes, primary statistical results, or integrative mixed methods insights.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Finish the abstract by mentioning the <span class="italic">practical implications</span> of the study. State the specific audiences who will benefit from the project and why they will benefit.</li></ol><p class="calibre_">Here is an example of a short abstract for a qualitative study that contains all five elements.</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">The issue that this study addresses is the lack of women in martial arts competitions. To address this problem, the purpose of this study will be exploring motivation of female athletes in Tae Kwon Do competitions. To gather data, interviews with 4 female Tae Kwon Do tournament competitors were conducted. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed. This data leads to the following 3 themes: social support, self-efficacy, and goal orientation. These themes will be useful for understanding the optimal way to increase motivation in female martial artists. (Witte, 2011, personal communication)</blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-113" class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Introductions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">A general review of all introductions shows that they follow a similar pattern: the author announces a problem and justifies why it needs to be studied. The type of problem presented in an introduction will vary depending on the approach (see <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter 1</a>). In a <span class="italic">qualitative</span> project, the author will describe a <a id="calibre_link-269"></a>research problem that can best be understood by exploring a concept or phenomenon. We have suggested that qualitative research is exploratory and that researchers use it to probe a topic when the variables and theory base are unknown. For example, Morse (1991) said this:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">Characteristics of a qualitative research problem are: (a) the concept is “immature” due to a conspicuous lack of theory and previous research; (b) a notion that the available theory may be inaccurate, inappropriate, incorrect, or biased; (c) a need exists to explore and describe the phenomena and to develop theory; or (d) the nature of the phenomenon may not be suited to quantitative measures. (p. 120)</blockquote><p class="calibre_3">For example, urban sprawl (a problem) needs to be explored because it has not been examined in certain areas of a state. Alternatively, kids in elementary classrooms have anxiety that interferes with learning (a problem), and the best way to explore this problem is to go to schools and visit directly with teachers and students. Some qualitative researchers have a transformative lens through which the problem will be examined (e.g., the inequality of pay among women and men or the racial attitudes involved in profiling drivers on the highways). Thomas (1993) suggested that “critical researchers begin from the premise that all cultural life is in constant tension between control and resistance” (p. 9). This theoretical orientation shapes the structure of an introduction. Beisel (1990), for example, proposed to examine how the theory of class politics explained the lack of success of an anti-vice campaign in one of three American cities. Thus, within some qualitative studies, the approach in the introduction may be less inductive while still relying on the perspective of participants, like most qualitative studies. In addition, qualitative introductions may begin with a personal statement of experiences from the author, such as those found in phenomenological studies (Moustakas, 1994). They also may be written from a personal, first person, subjective point of view in which the researcher positions herself or himself in the narrative.</p><p class="calibre_">Less variation is seen in quantitative introductions. In a quantitative project, the problem is best addressed by understanding what factors or variables influence an outcome. For example, in response to worker cutbacks (a problem for all employees), an investigator may seek to discover what factors influence businesses to downsize. Another researcher may need to understand the high divorce rate among married couples (a problem) and examine whether financial issues contribute to divorce. In both of these situations, the research problem is one in which understanding the factors that explain or relate to an outcome helps the investigator best understand and explain the problem. In addition, in quantitative introductions, researchers sometimes advance a theory to test, and they will incorporate substantial reviews of the literature to identify research questions that need to be <a id="calibre_link-384"></a>answered. A quantitative introduction may be written from the impersonal point of view and in the past tense, to convey objectivity.</p><p class="calibre_">A mixed methods study can employ either the qualitative or the quantitative approach (or some combination) to writing an introduction. In any given mixed methods study, the emphasis might tip in the direction of either quantitative or qualitative research, and the introduction will mirror that emphasis. For other mixed methods projects, the emphasis will be equal between qualitative and quantitative research. In this case, the problem may be one in which a need exists to both understand quantitatively the relationship among variables in a situation and explore qualitatively the topic in further depth. A mixed methods problem may also be that the existing research is primarily quantitative or qualitative in methodology, and a need exists to expand the approach to be more inclusive of diverse methodologies. A mixed methods project may initially seek to explain the relationship between smoking behavior and depression among adolescents, then explore the detailed views of these youth, and display different patterns of smoking and depression. With the first phase of this project as quantitative, the introduction may emphasize a quantitative approach with inclusion of a theory that predicts this relationship and a substantive review of the literature.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">A Model for an Introduction</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">These differences among the various approaches are small, and they relate largely to the different types of problems addressed in qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies. It should be helpful to illustrate an approach to designing and writing an introduction to a research study that researchers might use regardless of their approach.</p><p class="calibre_">The <span class="bold">deficiencies model of an introduction</span> is an approach to writing an introduction to a research study that builds on gaps existing in the literature. It includes the elements of stating the research problem, reviewing past studies about the problem, indicating deficiencies in these studies, and advancing the significance of the study. It is a general template for writing a good introduction. It is a popular approach used in the social sciences, and once its structure is elucidated, the reader will find it appearing repeatedly in many published research studies (not always in the order presented here). It consists of five parts, and a separate paragraph can be devoted to each part, for an introduction of about two pages in length:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">State the research problem.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Review studies that have addressed the problem.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Indicate deficiencies in the studies.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Advance the <span class="bold">significance of the study</span> for particular audiences.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">State the purpose statement.</li></ol><p id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre_20">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">An Illustration</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Before a review of each part, here is an excellent example from a quantitative study published by Terenzini, Cabrera, Colbeck, Bjorklund, and Parente (2001) in <span class="italic">The Journal of Higher Education</span> and titled “Racial and Ethnic Diversity in the Classroom” (reprinted with permission). Following each major section in the introduction, we briefly highlight the component being addressed.<a id="calibre_link-395"></a></p><blockquote class="calibre_32">Since passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Higher Education Act of 1965, America’s colleges and universities have struggled to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of their students and faculty members, and “affirmative action” has become the policy-of-choice to achieve that heterogeneity. <span class="italic">[Authors state the narrative hook to create reader interest</span>.<span class="italic">]</span> These policies, however, are now at the center of an intense national debate. The current legal foundation for affirmative action policies rests on the 1978 <span class="italic">Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</span> case, in which Justice William Powell argued that race could be considered among the factors on which admissions decisions were based. More recently, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in the 1996 <span class="italic">Hopwood v. State of Texas</span> case, found Powell’s argument wanting. Court decisions turning affirmative action policies aside have been accompanied by state referenda, legislation, and related actions banning or sharply reducing race-sensitive admissions or hiring in California, Florida, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico (Healy, 1998a, 1998b, 1999).</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_28">In response, educators and others have advanced educational arguments supporting affirmative action, claiming that a diverse student body is more educationally effective than a more homogeneous one. Harvard University President Neil Rudenstine claims that the “fundamental rationale for student diversity in higher education [is] its educational value” (Rudenstine, 1999, p. 1). Lee Bollinger, Rudenstine’s counterpart at the University of Michigan, has asserted, “A classroom that does not have a significant representation from members of different races produces an impoverished discussion” (Schmidt, 1998, p. A32). These two presidents are not alone in their beliefs. A statement published by the Association of American Universities and endorsed by the presidents of 62 research universities stated: “We speak first and foremost as educators. We believe that our students benefit significantly from education that takes place within a diverse setting” (“On the Importance of Diversity in University Admissions,” <span class="italic">The New York Times,</span> April 24, 1997, p. A27). <span class="italic">[Authors identify the research problem of the need for diversity.]</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_28">Studies of the impact of diversity on student educational outcomes tend to approach the ways students encounter “diversity” in any of three ways. A small group of studies treat students’ contacts with “diversity” largely as a function of the numerical or proportional racial/ethnic or gender mix of students on a campus (e.g., Chang, 1996, 1999a; Kanter, 1977; Sax, 1996). . . . A second considerably larger set of studies take some modicum of structural diversity as a given and operationalizes students’ encounters with diversity using the frequency or nature of their reported interactions with peers who are racially/ethnically different from themselves. . . . A third set of studies examines institutionally structured and purposeful programmatic efforts to help students engage racial/ethnic and/or gender “diversity” in the form of both ideas and people.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_28">These various approaches have been used to examine the effects of diversity on a broad array of student educational outcomes. The evidence is almost uniformly consistent in indicating that students in a racial/ethnically or gender-diverse community, or engaged in a diversity-related activity, reap a wide array of positive educational benefits. <span class="italic">[Authors mention studies that have addressed the problem.]</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_28">Only a relative handful of studies (e.g., Chang, 1996, 1999a; Sax, 1996) have specifically examined whether <span class="italic">the racial/ethnic or gender composition</span> of the students on a campus, in an academic major, or in a classroom (i.e., structural diversity) has the educational benefits claimed. . . . Whether the degree of racial diversity of a campus or classroom has a <span class="italic">direct</span> effect on learning outcomes, however, remains an open question. <span class="italic">[Deficiencies or the limitations in existing studies are noted.]</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_28">The scarcity of information on the educational benefits of the structural diversity on a campus or in its classrooms is regrettable because it is the sort of evidence the courts appear to be requiring if they are to support race-sensitive admissions policies. <span class="italic">[Importance of the study for campus audiences is mentioned.]</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_28">This study attempted to contribute to the knowledge base by exploring the influence of structural diversity in the classroom on students’ development of academic and intellectual skills. . . . This study examines both the direct effect of classroom diversity on academic/intellectual outcomes and whether any effects of classroom diversity may be moderated by the extent to which active and collaborative instructional approaches are used in the course. <span class="italic">[Purpose of the study is identified.]</span> (pp. 510&ndash;512, reprinted by permission of <span class="italic">The Journal of Higher Education</span>)</blockquote><p id="calibre_link-116" class="calibre_21">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Research Problem</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In Terenzini and colleagues’ (2001) article, the first sentence accomplishes both primary objectives for an introduction: (a) piquing interest in the study and (b) conveying a distinct research problem or issue. What effect did this sentence have? Would it entice a reader to read on? Was it pitched at a level so that a wide audience could understand it? These questions are important for opening sentences, and they are called a <span class="bold">narrative hook,</span> a term drawn from English composition, meaning words that serve to draw, engage, or hook the reader into the study. To learn how to write good narrative hooks, study first sentences in leading journals in different fields of study. Often, journalists provide good examples in the lead sentences of newspaper and magazine articles. Here, follow a few examples of lead sentences from social science journals:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">“The transsexual and ethno methodological celebrity Agnes changed her identity nearly three years before undergoing sex reassignment surgery.” (Cahill, 1989, p. 281)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">“Who controls the process of chief executive succession?” (Boeker, 1992, p. 400)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">“There is a large body of literature that studies the cartographic line (a recent summary article is Butte in field, 1985), and generalization of cartographic lines (McMaster, 1987).” (Carstensen, 1989, p. 181)</li></ul><p class="calibre_">All three of these examples present information easily understood by many readers. The first two&mdash;introductions in qualitative studies&mdash;demonstrate how reader interest can be created by reference to the single participant and by posing a question. The third example, a quantitative-experimental study, shows how one can begin with a literature perspective. All three examples demonstrate well how the lead sentence can be written so that the reader is not taken into a detailed morass of thought but lowered gently into the topic.</p><p class="calibre_">We use the metaphor of the writer lowering a barrel into a well. The <span class="italic">beginning</span> writer plunges the barrel (the reader) into the depths of the well (the article). The reader sees only unfamiliar material. The <span class="italic">experienced</span> writer lowers the barrel (the reader, again) slowly, allowing the reader to acclimate to the depths (of the study). This lowering of the barrel begins with <span class="italic">a narrative hook</span> of sufficient generality that the reader understands and can relate to the topic.</p><p class="calibre_">Beyond this first sentence, it is important to clearly identify the issue(s) or problem(s) that leads to a need for the study. Terenzini and colleagues (2001) discussed a distinct problem: the struggle to increase the racial and ethnic diversity on U.S. college and university campuses. They noted that policies to increase diversity are at “the center of an intense national debate” (p. 509).</p><p id="calibre_link-396" class="calibre_">In applied social science research, problems arise from issues, difficulties, and current practices in real-life situations. The research problem in a study begins to become clear when the researcher asks, “What is the need for this study?” or “What problem influenced the need to undertake this study?” For example, schools may not have implemented multicultural guidelines, the needs of faculty in colleges are such that they need to engage in professional development activities in their departments, minority students need better access to universities, or a community needs to better understand the contributions of its early female pioneers. These are all significant research problems that merit further study and establish a practical issue or concern that needs to be addressed. When designing the opening paragraphs of a proposal, which includes the research problem, keep in mind these <span class="bold">research tips</span>:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Write an opening sentence that will stimulate reader interest as well as convey an issue to which a broad audience can relate.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">As a general rule, refrain from using quotations&mdash;especially long ones&mdash;in the lead sentence because it will be difficult for readers to grasp the key idea you would like for them to see. Quotations raise many possibilities for interpretation and thus create unclear beginnings.

</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Studies Addressing the Problem</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">After establishing the research problem in the opening paragraphs, Terenzini and colleagues (2001) next justified its importance by <span class="bold">reviewing studies</span> that have examined the issue. We do not have in mind a complete literature review for the introduction passage. It is later, in the literature review section of a proposal, that students thoroughly review the literature. Instead, in the introduction, this literature review passage should summarize large groups of studies instead of individual ones. We tell students to reflect on their literature maps (described in <a href="#calibre_link-8">Chapter 2</a>) and look at and summarize the broad categories at the top into which they assigned their literature. These broad categories are what we mean by reviewing studies in an introduction to a proposal.</p><p class="calibre_">The purpose of reviewing studies in an introduction is to justify the importance of the study and to create distinctions between past studies and the proposed one. This component might be called “setting the research problem within the ongoing dialogue in the literature.” Researchers do not want to conduct a study that replicates exactly what someone else has examined. New studies need to add to the literature or to extend or retest what others have investigated. The ability to frame the study in this way separates novices from more experienced researchers. The veteran has reviewed and understands what has been written about a topic or certain problem in the field. This knowledge comes from years of experience following the development of problems and their accompanying literature.</p><p class="calibre_">The question often arises as to what type of literature to review. Our best advice would be to review research studies in which authors advance research questions and report data to answer them (i.e., empirical articles). These studies might be quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods studies. The important point is that the literature provides the research being addressed in the proposal. Beginning researchers often ask, “What do I do now? No research has been conducted on my topic.” Of course, in some narrowly construed studies or in new, exploratory projects, no literature exists to document the research problem. Also, it makes sense that a topic is being proposed for study precisely because little research has been conducted on it. To counter this comment we suggest that an investigator think about the literature, using an inverted triangle as an image. At the bottom of the apex of the inverted triangle lies the scholarly study being proposed. This study is narrow and focused (and studies may not exist on it). If one broadens the review of the literature upward from the base of the inverted triangle, literature can be found, although it may be somewhat removed from the study at hand. For example, the narrow topic of at-risk African Americans in primary school may not have been researched; however, more broadly speaking, the topic of at-risk students generally in the primary school or at any level in education, may have been studied. The researcher would summarize the more general literature and end with <a id="calibre_link-385"></a>statements about a need for studies that examine at-risk African American students at the primary school level.</p><p class="calibre_">To review the literature related to the research problem for an introduction to a proposal, consider these <span class="bold">research tips</span>:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Refer to the literature by summarizing groups of studies, not individual ones (unlike the focus on single studies in the integrated review in <a href="#calibre_link-8">Chapter 2</a>).

Hence, we call this template for writing an introduction a <span class="italic">deficiencies model.</span> The nature of these deficiencies varies from study to study. <span class="bold">Deficiencies in past literature</span> may exist because topics have not been explored with a particular group, sample, or population; the literature may need to be replicated or repeated to see if the same findings hold because of mixed results given new samples of people or new sites for study; or the voices of underrepresented groups have not been heard in published literature. In any study, authors may mention one or more of these deficiencies. Deficiencies can often be found in the “suggestions for future research” sections of journal articles, and authors can reference these ideas and provide further justification for their proposed study.</p><p class="calibre_">Beyond mentioning the deficiencies, proposal writers need to tell how their planned study will remedy or address these deficiencies. For example, because past studies have overlooked an important variable, a study will include it and analyze its effect. For instance, because past studies have overlooked the examination of Native Americans as a cultural group, a study will include them as the participants in the project.</p><p class="calibre_">In <a href="#calibre_link-119">Examples 5.1</a> and <a href="#calibre_link-120">5.2</a>, the authors point out the gaps or shortcomings of the literature.

First, understanding relationships among ownership and domain dimensions can help to reveal the underlying logic of organizations’ activities and can help organization members evaluate strategies. . . . Second, a fundamental decision confronting all societies concerns the type of institutions to encourage or adopt for the conduct of activity. . . . Knowledge of the domain consequences of different ownership types can serve as input to that decision. . . .

It is the most important statement in the entire study, and it needs to be clear, specific, and informative. From it, all other aspects of the research follow, and readers will be lost unless it is carefully drafted. In journal articles, researchers write the purpose statement into introductions as the final statement; in theses and dissertations, it often stands as a separate section.</p><p class="calibre_">In this chapter devoted exclusively to the purpose statement, we address the reasons for developing it, key principles to use in its design, and examples of good models in crafting one for your proposal.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Significance and Meaning of a Purpose Statement</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">According to Locke, Spirduso, and Silverman (2013), the purpose statement indicates why you want to conduct the study and what you intend to accomplish. Unfortunately, proposal-writing texts give little attention to the purpose statement, and writers on method often incorporate it into discussions about other topics, such as specifying research questions or hypotheses. Wilkinson (1991), for example, refers to it within the context of the research question and objective. Other authors frame it as an aspect of the research problem (Castetter &amp; Heisler, 1977). Closely examining their discussions, however, indicates that they both refer to the purpose statement as the central, controlling idea in a study.</p><p class="calibre_">This passage is called the purpose statement because it conveys the overall intent of a proposed study in a sentence or several sentences. It may also be called a study aim or the research objective of a project. In proposals, researchers need to distinguish clearly between the purpose statement, the research problem, and the research questions. The purpose statement sets forth the intent of the study, not the problem or issue leading to a need for the study (see <a href="#calibre_link-12">Chapter 5</a>). The purpose is also not the research questions&mdash;those questions that the data collection will attempt to answer (discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-14">Chapter 7</a>). Instead and again, the purpose statement sets the objectives, the intent, or the major idea of a proposal or a study. This idea builds on a need (the problem) and is refined into specific questions (the research questions).</p><p class="calibre_">Given the importance of the purpose statement, it is helpful to set it apart from other aspects of the proposal or study and to frame it as a single <a id="calibre_link-258"></a>sentence or paragraph that readers can easily identify. Although qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods purpose statements share similar topics, each is identified in the following paragraphs and illustrated with fill-in scripts for constructing a thorough but manageable purpose statement.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-127" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">A Qualitative Purpose Statement</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Good <span class="bold">qualitative purpose statements</span> contain information about the <span class="bold">central phenomenon</span> explored in the study, the participants in the study, and the research site. It also conveys an emerging design and uses research words drawn from the language of qualitative inquiry (Schwandt, 2014). Thus, one might consider several basic design features for writing this statement:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Use words such as <span class="italic">purpose, intent, study aim,</span> or <span class="italic">objective</span> to signal attention to this statement as the central controlling idea. Set the statement off as a separate sentence or paragraph, and use the language of research, such as “The purpose (or intent or objective) of this study is (was) (will be) . . .” Researchers often use the present or past verb tense in journal articles and dissertations and the future tense in proposals because researchers are presenting a proposal for a study not yet undertaken.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Focus on a single phenomenon (or concept or idea). Narrow the study to one idea to be explored or understood. This focus means that a purpose does not convey relating two or more variables or comparing two or more groups, as is typically found in quantitative research. Instead, advance a single phenomenon, recognizing that the study may evolve into an exploration of relationships or comparisons among ideas. None of these related explorations could be anticipated at the beginning. For example, a project might begin by exploring teacher identity and the marginalization of this identity in a particular school (Huber &amp; Whelan, 1999), the meaning of baseball culture in a study of the work and talk of stadium employees (Trujillo, 1992), or how individuals cognitively represent AIDS (Anderson &amp; Spencer, 2002). These examples illustrate a focus on a single idea.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Use action verbs to convey how learning will take place. Action verbs and phrases, such as, <span class="italic">understand, develop, explore, examine the meaning of, generate,</span> or <span class="italic">discover</span>, keep the inquiry open and convey an emerging design.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Use neutral words and phrases&mdash;nondirectional language&mdash;such as, exploring the “self-expression experiences of individuals” rather than the “<span class="italic">successful</span> self-expression of individuals.” Other words and phrases that may be problematic include <span class="italic">useful, positive</span>, and <span class="italic">informing</span>&mdash;all words that suggest a directional outcome that may or may not occur. McCracken (1988) referred to the need in qualitative interviews to let the respondent describe his or her experience. Interviewers (or purpose statement writers) can easily violate the “law of nondirection” (McCracken, 1988, p. 21) in qualitative research by using words that suggest a directional orientation.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Provide a general working definition of the central phenomenon or idea, especially if the phenomenon is a term that is not typically understood by a broad audience. Consistent with the rhetoric of qualitative research, this definition is not rigid and set but tentative and evolving throughout a study based on information from participants. Hence, a writer might say, “A tentative definition at this time for ___________ (central phenomenon) is . . .” It should also be noted that this definition is not to be confused with the detailed definition of terms section as discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-8">Chapter 2</a> on the review of the literature. The intent here is to convey to readers at an early stage in a proposal or research study a general sense of the central phenomenon so that they can better understand the types of questions and responses asked of participants and data sources.</li><a id="calibre_link-402"></a><li value="6" class="calibre_16">Include words denoting the strategy of inquiry to be used in data collection, analysis, and the process of research, such as whether the study will use an ethnographic, grounded theory, case study, phenomenological, narrative approach, or some other strategy.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">Mention the participants in the study, such as one or more individuals, a group of people, or an entire organization.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">Identify the site for the research, such as homes, classrooms, organizations, programs, or events. Describe this site in enough detail so that the reader knows exactly where a study will take place.</li><li value="9" class="calibre_16">As a final thought in the purpose statement, include some language that delimits the scope of participation or research sites in the study. For example, the study may be limited to women or Latinas only. The research site may be limited to one metropolitan city or to one small geographic area. The central phenomenon may be limited to individuals in business organizations who participate in creative teams. These delimitations help to further define the parameters of the research study.</li></ul><p class="calibre_">Although considerable variation exists in the inclusion of these points in purpose statements, a good dissertation or thesis proposal should contain many of them.</p><p class="calibre_">To assist you, here is a <span class="bold">script</span> that should be helpful in drafting a complete statement.

Her purpose statement was as follows:</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">The phenomenological inquiry, as part of uncovering meaning, articulated “essences” of meaning in mothers’ lived experiences when their wished-for babies died. Using the lens of the feminist perspective, the focus was on mothers’ memories and their “living through” experience. This perspective facilitated breaking through the silence surrounding mothers’ experiences; it assisted in articulating and amplifying mothers’ memories and their stories of loss. Methods of inquiry included phenomenological reflection on data elicited by existential investigation of mothers’ experiences, and investigation of the phenomenon in the creative arts. (p. 134)</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_43">We found Lauterbach’s (1993) purpose statement in the opening section of the journal article under the heading “Aim of Study.” Thus, the heading calls attention to this statement. “Mothers’ lived experiences” would be the central phenomenon, the key being explored in a qualitative study, and the author uses the action word <span class="italic">portray</span> to discuss the <span class="italic">meaning</span> (a neutral word) of these experiences. The author further defined what experiences were examined when she identifies “memories” and “lived through” experiences. Throughout this passage, it is clear that Lauterbach used the strategy of phenomenology. Also, the passage conveys that the participants were mothers, and later in the article, the reader learns that the author interviewed a convenience sample of five mothers, each of whom had experienced a perinatal death of a child in her home.</p><blockquote id="calibre_link-129" class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">Example 6.2 A Purpose Statement in a Case Study</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Kos (1991) conducted a multiple case study of perceptions of reading-disabled middle school students concerning factors that prevented these students from progressing in their reading development.

Recall from <a href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter 3</a> the types of major variables: independent, mediating, moderating, and dependent.</p><p class="calibre_">The design of a quantitative purpose statement includes the variables in the study and their relationship, the participants, and the research site. It also includes language associated with quantitative research and the deductive testing of relationships or theories. A quantitative purpose statement begins with identifying the proposed major variables in a study (independent, intervening, dependent), accompanied by a visual model to clearly identify this sequence, and locating and specifying how the variables will be measured or observed. Finally, the intent of using the variables quantitatively will typically be either to relate variables, as one usually finds in a survey, or to compare samples or groups in terms of an outcome, as commonly found in experiments.</p><p class="calibre_">The major components of a good quantitative purpose statement include the following:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Include words to signal the major intent of the study, such as <span class="italic">purpose, intent</span>, or <span class="italic">objective</span>.

At this point, one does not need to describe it in detail; in <a href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter 3</a>, we suggested the possibility of writing a separate “Theoretical Perspective” section for this purpose.

Also, a purpose statement could be to “describe” variables. Most quantitative studies employ one or more of these three options for discussing variables in the purpose statement. A combination of comparing and relating might also exist&mdash;for example, a two-factor experiment in which the researcher has two or more treatment groups as well as a continuous independent variable. Although one typically finds studies about comparing two or more groups in experiments, it is also possible to compare groups in a survey study.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Position or order the variables from left to right in the purpose statement&mdash;with the independent variable followed by the dependent variable. Place intervening variables between the independent and dependent variables. Many researchers also place the moderating variables as related to the independent variables. In experiments, the independent variable will always be the manipulated variable.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">Mention the specific type of strategy of inquiry (such as survey or experimental research) used in the study. By incorporating this information, the researcher anticipates the methods discussion and enables a reader to associate the relationship of variables to the inquiry approach.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">Make reference to the participants (or the unit of analysis) in the study, and mention the research site.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">Generally define each key variable, preferably using set and accepted established definitions found in the literature. General definitions are included at this point to help the reader best understand the purpose statement. They do not replace specific, operational definitions found later when a writer has a “Definition of Terms” section in a proposal (details about how variables will be measured). Also, delimitations that affect the scope of the study might be mentioned, such as the scope of the data collection or limited to certain individuals.</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-344" class="calibre_">Based on these points, a quantitative purpose statement script can include these ideas:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">The purpose of this ___________ (experiment? survey?) study is (was? will be?) to test the theory of ___________ that ___________ (describes outcomes) or ___________ (compares? relates?) the ___________ (independent variable) to ___________ (dependent variable), controlling for ___________ (mediating or moderating variables) for ___________ (participants) at ___________ (the research site).

The examination of background information was important to this study because it was hoped it would be possible to identify characteristics and factors contributing to significant differences in mobility and motivation. The second part of the study asked the respondents to identify those motivational factors of concern to them. Job motivation was defined by six general factors identified in the educational work components study (EWCS) questionnaire (Miskel &amp; Heller, 1973).

The first signpost is the purpose statement, which establishes the central intent for the study. The next would be the research questions or hypotheses that narrow the purpose statement to predictions about what will be learned or questions to be answered in the study. This chapter begins by advancing several principles in designing qualitative research questions and helpful scripts for writing these questions. It then turns to the design of quantitative research questions and hypotheses and ways to write these elements into a study. Finally, it advances the use of research questions and hypotheses in mixed methods studies, and it suggests the development of a unique mixed methods question that ties together or integrates the quantitative and qualitative data in a study.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-143" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Qualitative Research Questions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In a qualitative study, inquirers state research questions, not objectives (i.e., specific goals for the research) or hypotheses (i.e., predictions that involve variables and statistical tests). These research questions assume two forms: (a) a <span class="bold">central question</span> and (b) associated subquestions.</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Ask one or two central research questions.</span> The central question is a broad question that asks for an exploration of the central phenomenon or concept in a study. The inquirer poses this question, consistent with the emerging methodology of qualitative research, as a general issue so as to not limit the views of participants. To arrive at this question, <span class="italic">ask,</span> “What is the broadest question that I can ask in the study?” Beginning researchers trained in quantitative research might struggle with this approach because they are accustomed to reverse thinking. They narrow the quantitative study to specific, narrow questions or hypotheses based on a few variables. In qualitative research, the intent is to explore the general, complex set of factors surrounding the central phenomenon and present the broad, varied perspectives or meanings that participants hold. The following are guidelines for writing qualitative research questions:</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Ask no more than five to seven subquestions in addition to your central questions.</span> Several subquestions follow each general central question; they narrow the focus of the study but leave open the questioning. This approach is well within the limits set by Miles and Huberman (1994), who recommended that researchers write no more than a dozen qualitative research questions in all (central and subquestions). The subquestions, in turn, become specific questions used during interviews (or in observing or when looking at documents). In developing an interview protocol or guide, the researcher might ask an icebreaker question at the beginning, for example, followed by five or so subquestions in the study (see <a href="#calibre_link-16">Chapter 9</a>). The interview would then end with an additional wrap-up or summary question or by asking, “Who should I turn to, to learn more about this topic?” (Asmussen &amp; Creswell, 1995).</li><a id="calibre_link-259"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Relate the central question to the specific qualitative strategy of inquiry</span>. For example, the specificity of the questions in ethnography at this stage of the design differs from that in other qualitative strategies. In ethnographic research, Spradley (1980) advanced a taxonomy of ethnographic questions that included a mini-tour of the culture-sharing group, their experiences, use of native language, contrasts with other cultural groups, and questions to verify the accuracy of the data. In critical ethnography, the research questions may build on a body of existing literature. These questions become working guidelines rather than proven truths (Thomas, 1993, p. 35). Alternatively, in phenomenology, the questions might be broadly stated without specific reference to the existing literature or a typology of questions. Moustakas (1994) talked about asking what the participants experienced and what contexts or situations in which they experienced it. A phenomenological example is “What is it like for a mother to live with a teenage child who is dying of cancer?” (Nieswiadomy, 1993, p. 151). In grounded theory, the questions may be directed toward generating a theory of some process, such as the exploration of a process as to how caregivers and patients interact in a hospital setting. In a qualitative case study, the questions may address a description of the case and the themes that emerge from studying it.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Begin the research questions with the words</span> what <span class="italic">or</span> how <span class="italic">to convey an open and emerging design.</span> The word <span class="italic">why</span> often implies that the researcher is trying to explain why something occurs, and this suggests to us probable cause-and-effect thinking that we associate with <span class="italic">quantitative</span> research and that limits the explanations rather than opening them up for participant views.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Focus on a single phenomenon or concept.</span> As a study develops over time, factors will emerge that may influence this single phenomenon, but begin a study with a single focus to explore in great detail.

They are frequently used in social science research and especially in survey studies. <span class="bold">Quantitative hypotheses,</span> on the other hand, are predictions the researcher makes about the expected outcomes of relationships among variables. They are numeric estimates of population values based on data collected from samples. Testing of hypotheses employs statistical procedures in which the investigator draws inferences about the population from a study sample (see also <a href="#calibre_link-15">Chapter 8</a>). Hypotheses are used often in experiments or intervention trials in which investigators compare groups. Advisers sometimes recommend their use in a formal research project, such as a dissertation or thesis, as a means of stating the direction a study will take. Objectives, on the other hand, indicate the goals or objectives for a study. They often appear in proposals for funding, but tend to be used with less frequency in social and health science research. Because of this, the focus here will be on research questions and hypotheses.</p><p id="calibre_link-401" class="calibre_">Here is an example of a script for a quantitative research question describing outcomes of score for a variable:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">What is the frequency and variation of scores on ____________(name the variable) for ______________(participants) in the study?</blockquote><p class="calibre_3">Here is an example of a script for a quantitative research question focused on examining the relationship among variables:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">Does _________ (name the theory) explain the relationship between _________ (independent variable) and _________ (dependent variable), controlling for the effects of _________ (mediating variable)?</blockquote><p class="calibre_3">Alternatively, a script for a quantitative <span class="bold">null hypothesis</span> might be as follows:</p><blockquote class="calibre_32">There is no significant difference between _________ (the control and experimental groups on the independent variable) on _________ (dependent variable).</blockquote><p class="calibre_3">Guidelines for writing good quantitative research questions and hypotheses include the following.</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">The use of variables in research questions or hypotheses is typically limited to three basic approaches. The researcher may <span class="italic">compare</span> groups on an independent variable to see its impact on a dependent variable (this would be an experiment or group comparisons). Alternatively, the investigator may <span class="italic">relate</span> one or more independent variables to one or more dependent variables (this would be a survey that correlates variables). Third, the researcher may <span class="italic">describe</span> responses to the independent, mediating, or dependent variables (this would be a descriptive study). Most quantitative research falls into one or more of these three categories.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">The most rigorous form of quantitative research follows from a test of a theory (see <a href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter 3</a>) and the specification of research questions or hypotheses that logically follow from the relationship among variables in the theory.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">The independent and dependent variables must be measured separately and not measured on the same concept. This procedure reinforces the cause-and-effect logic of quantitative research.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">To eliminate redundancy, write only research questions or hypotheses&mdash;not both&mdash;unless the hypotheses build on the research questions. Choose the form based on tradition, recommendations from an adviser or faculty committee, or whether past research indicates a prediction about outcomes.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">If hypotheses are used, there are two forms: (a) null and (b) alternative. A null hypothesis represents the traditional approach: It makes a prediction that in the general population, no relationship or no significant difference exists between groups on a variable. The wording is, “There is no difference (or relationship)” between the groups. <a href="#calibre_link-147">Example 7.3</a> illustrates a null hypothesis.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">The second form, popular in journal articles, is the alternative or <span class="bold">directional hypothesis</span>. The investigator makes a prediction about the expected outcome, basing this prediction on prior literature and studies on the topic that suggest a potential outcome. For example, the researcher may predict that “scores will be higher for Group A than for Group B” on the dependent variable or that “Group A will change more than Group B” on the outcome. These examples illustrate a directional hypothesis because an expected prediction (e.g., higher, more change) is made. <a href="#calibre_link-148">Example 7.4</a> illustrates a directional hypothesis.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">Another type of alternative statement is the <span class="bold">nondirectional hypothesis</span>&mdash;a prediction is made, but the exact form of differences (e.g., higher, lower, more, less) is not specified because the researcher does not know what can be predicted from past literature. Thus, the investigator might write, “There is a difference” between the two groups. <a href="#calibre_link-149">Example 7.5</a> incorporates both types of hypotheses.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">Unless the study intentionally employs demographic variables as predictors, use nondemographic variables (i.e., attitudes or behaviors) as <span class="bold">mediating variables.</span> These are variables that “stand between” the independent and dependent variables. Demographic variables are often used as <span class="bold">moderating variables</span> that affect the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable. Because quantitative studies attempt to verify theories, demographic variables (e.g., age, income level, educational level) typically enter these studies as moderating variables instead of major independent variables.</li><li value="9" class="calibre_16">Use the same pattern of word order in the questions or hypotheses to enable a reader to easily identify the major variables. This calls for repeating key phrases and positioning the variables with the independent first and concluding with the dependent in left-to-right order (as discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-13">Chapter 6</a> on good purpose statements). <a href="#calibre_link-150">Example 7.6</a> illustrates word order with independent variables stated first in the phrase.</li></ul><blockquote id="calibre_link-147" class="calibre_44"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre_37">

We recommend this descriptive-inferential model. This example also illustrated the use of variables to describe as well as relate. It specified the independent variables in the first position in the questions, the dependent in the second, and the mediating variable in the third.

However, discussion now exists about the use of a new type of research question&mdash;a mixed methods question&mdash;in studies and commentary as to how to design them (see Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011, 2018 Tashakkori &amp; Creswell, 2007). A strong mixed methods study should contain at least three research questions: the qualitative question, the quantitative question or hypothesis, <a id="calibre_link-308"></a>and a mixed methods question. This mixed methods question represents what the researcher needs to know about the integration or combination of the quantitative and qualitative data. This configuration is necessary because mixed methods does not rely exclusively on either qualitative or quantitative research but on <span class="italic">both</span> forms of inquiry. Researchers should consider what types of questions should be presented and when and what information is most needed to convey the nature of the study:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Both qualitative and quantitative research questions (or hypotheses) need to be advanced in a mixed methods study in order to narrow and focus the purpose statement. Before the two databases can be integrated or combined, they need to be analyzed separately in response to questions (or hypotheses). These questions or hypotheses can be advanced at the beginning or emerge during a later phase of the research. For example, if the study begins with a quantitative phase, the investigator might introduce hypotheses. Later in the study, when the qualitative phase is addressed, the qualitative research questions appear.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">When writing these questions or hypotheses, follow the guidelines in this chapter for scripting good questions or hypotheses.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Some attention should be given to the order of the research questions and hypotheses. The order will reflect the type of mixed methods design being used, as will be discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-17">Chapter 10</a>. In a single-phase mixed methods project in which the quantitative and qualitative results are merged, either the quantitative or the qualitative questions can be posed first. In a two-phase project, the first-phase questions would come first, followed by the second-phase questions so that readers see them in the order in which they will be addressed in the proposed study. In a three-phase project, often the mixed methods question will reside in the middle in the order of questioning, and the first-phase question will be qualitative and the final-phase question will be quantitative. These different types of phased projects will be discussed later in <a href="#calibre_link-17">Chapter 10</a> as specific types of mixed methods research designs.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">In addition to quantitative questions/hypotheses and qualitative questions, include a <span class="bold">mixed methods research question</span> that directly addresses the mixing or integration of the quantitative and qualitative strands of the research. This is the question that will be answered in the study based on the mixing (see Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2018). This is an innovative form of a question in research methods, and Tashakkori and Creswell (2007, p. 208) call it a “hybrid” or “integrated” question.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">The mixed methods question can be written in different ways. This can assume one of three forms. The first is to write it in a way that conveys the methods or procedures in a study (e.g., Does the qualitative data help explain the results from the initial quantitative phase of the study?). The second form is to write it in a way that conveys the content of the study (e.g., Does the theme of social support help to explain why some students become bullies in schools?) (see Tashakkori &amp; Creswell, 2007). The third approach is to combine the methods and content as a hybrid question (e.g., How does the qualitative interview data on student bullying further explain why social support, as measured quantitatively, tends to discourage bullying as measured on a bullying scale?).</li><a id="calibre_link-340"></a><li value="6" class="calibre_16">Consider how to present the quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods questions in a mixed methods study. An ideal format would be to write the questions into separate sections, such as the quantitative questions or hypotheses, the qualitative questions, and the mixed methods question. This format highlights the importance of all three sets of questions and draws the readers’ attention to the separate quantitative and qualitative strands coming together (or being integrated) in a mixed methods study. Often researchers position the mixed methods question (written in methods or content or some combination form) last because the study will build to this element of the design.</li></ul><p class="calibre_"><a href="#calibre_link-154">Example 7.8</a> is a good illustration of a mixed methods question focused on the intent of mixing, to integrate the qualitative interviews and the quantitative data, the relationship of scores and student performance.

Nevertheless, her study was a rigorous mixed methods investigation. She studied the differences between middle school (nontraditional) and junior high (traditional) instructional strategies for seventh-grade and eighth-grade students and their attitudes toward science and science achievement. Her study was conducted at a point when many schools were moving away from the 2-year junior high concept to the 3-year middle school (including sixth grade) approach to education. In this two-phase study, the first phase involved assessing pretest and posttest attitudes and achievement using scales and examination scores. Houtz then followed the quantitative results with qualitative interviews with science teachers, the school principal, and consultants. This second phase helped to explain differences and similarities in the two instructional approaches obtained in the first phase.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">With a first-phase quantitative study, Houtz (1995) mentioned the hypotheses guiding her research:</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">It was hypothesized that there would be no significant difference between students in the middle school and those in the junior high in attitude toward science as a school subject. It was also hypothesized that there would be no significant difference between students in the middle school and those in the junior high in achievement in science (p. 630)</span></blockquote><blockquote id="calibre_link-332" class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">These hypotheses appeared at the beginning of the study as an introduction to the quantitative phase. Prior to the qualitative phase, Houtz (1995) raised questions to explore the quantitative results in more depth. Focusing in on the achievement test results, she interviewed science teachers, the principal, and the university consultants and asked three questions:</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">What differences currently exist between the middle school instructional strategy and the junior high instructional strategy at this school in transition? How has this transition period impacted science attitude and achievement of your students? How do teachers feel about this change process? (p. 649)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">Examining this mixed methods study closely shows that the author included both quantitative and qualitative questions, specified them at the beginning of each phase of her study, and used good elements for writing both quantitative hypotheses and qualitative research questions.

</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Summary</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Research questions and hypotheses narrow the purpose statement and become major signposts for readers. Qualitative researchers ask at least one central question and several subquestions. They begin the questions with words such as </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">how</span></span><span class="calibre3"> or </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">what</span></span><span class="calibre3"> and use exploratory verbs, such as </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">explore, understand,</span></span><span class="calibre3"> or </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">discover</span></span><span class="calibre3">. They pose broad, general questions to allow the participants to explain their ideas. They also focus initially on one central phenomenon of interest. The questions may also mention the participants and the site for the research.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Quantitative researchers write either research questions or hypotheses. Both forms include variables that are described, related, or compared with the independent and dependent variables measured separately. In many quantitative proposals, writers use research questions; however, a more formal statement of research employs hypotheses. These hypotheses are predictions about the outcomes of the results, and they may be written as alternative hypotheses specifying the results to be expected (more or less, higher or lower of something). They also may be stated in the null form, indicating no expected difference or no relationship between groups on a dependent variable. Typically, the researcher writes the independent variable(s) first, followed by the dependent variable(s). One model for ordering the questions in a quantitative proposal is to begin with descriptive questions followed by the inferential questions that relate variables or compare groups.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">We encourage mixed methods researchers to write quantitative, qualitative, </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">and</span></span><span class="calibre3"> a mixed methods question into their studies. The mixed methods question might be written to emphasize the methods or the content of the study, or both, and these questions might be placed at different points in a study. By adding a mixed methods question, the researcher conveys the importance of integrating or combining the quantitative and qualitative elements. An ideal format would be to write the three types of questions into separate sections, such as the quantitative questions or hypotheses, the qualitative questions, and the mixed methods question into a study.</span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><blockquote id="calibre_link-157" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Writing Exercises</span></span></blockquote><div class="calibre_38">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">For a qualitative study, write one or two central questions followed by five to seven subquestions.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">For a quantitative study, write two sets of questions.

This chapter presents essential steps in designing quantitative methods for a research proposal or study, with specific focus on survey and experimental designs. These designs reflect postpositivist philosophical assumptions, as discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter 1</a>. For example, determinism suggests that examining the relationships between and among variables is central to answering questions and hypotheses through surveys and experiments. In one case, a researcher might be interested in evaluating whether playing violent video games <span class="italic">is associated with</span> higher rates of playground aggression in kids, which is a correlational hypothesis that could be evaluated in a survey design. In another case, a researcher might be interested in evaluating whether violent video game playing <span class="italic">causes</span> aggressive behavior, which is a causal hypothesis that is best evaluated by a true experiment. In each case, these quantitative approaches focus on carefully measuring (or experimentally manipulating) a parsimonious set of variables to answer theory-guided research questions and hypotheses. In this chapter, the focus is on the essential components of a method section in proposals for a survey or experimental study.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-159" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Defining Surveys and Experiments</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">A <span class="bold">survey design</span> provides a quantitative description of trends, attitudes, and opinions of a population, or tests for associations among variables of a population, by studying a sample of that population. Survey designs help researchers answer three types of questions: (a) descriptive questions (e.g., What percentage of practicing nurses support the provision of hospital abortion services?); (b) questions about the relationships between variables (e.g., Is there a positive association between endorsement of hospital abortion services and support for implementing hospice care among nurses?); or in cases where a survey design is repeated over time in a longitudinal study; (c) questions about predictive relationships between variables over time (e.g., Does Time 1 endorsement of support for hospital abortion services predict greater Time 2 burnout in nurses?).</p><p class="calibre_">An <span class="bold">experimental design</span> systematically manipulates one or more variables in order to evaluate how this manipulation impacts an outcome (or outcomes) of interest. Importantly, an experiment isolates the effects of this manipulation by holding all other variables constant. When one group receives a treatment and the other group does not (which is a manipulated variable of interest), <a id="calibre_link-389"></a>the experimenter can isolate whether the treatment and <span class="italic">not</span> other factors influence the outcome. For example, a sample of nurses could be randomly assigned to a 3-week expressive writing program (where they write about their deepest thoughts and feelings) or a matched 3-week control writing program (writing about the facts of their daily morning routine) to evaluate whether this expressive writing manipulation reduces job burnout in the months following the program (i.e., the writing condition is the manipulated variable of interest, and job burnout is the outcome of interest). Whether a quantitative study employs a survey or experimental design, both approaches share a common goal of helping the researcher make inferences about relationships among variables, and how the sample results may generalize to a broader population of interest (e.g., all nurses in the community).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-160" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Components of a Survey Study Method Plan</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">The design of a survey method plan follows a standard format. Numerous examples of this format appear in scholarly journals, and these examples provide useful models. The following sections detail typical components. In preparing to design these components into a proposal, consider the questions on the checklist shown in <a href="#calibre_link-229">Table 8.1</a> as a general guide.</p><blockquote class="calibre_28"><img src="images/000016.jpg" id="calibre_link-229" class="calibre_57" />

</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Survey Design</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">The first parts of the survey method plan section can introduce readers to the basic purpose and rationale for survey research. Begin the section by describing the rationale for the design. Specifically:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Identify the purpose of survey research. The primary purpose is to answer a question (or questions) about variables of interest to you. A sample purpose statement could read: “The primary purpose of this study is to empirically evaluate whether the number of overtime hours worked predicts subsequent burnout symptoms in a sample of emergency room nurses.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Indicate why a survey method is the preferred type of approach for this study. In this rationale, it can be beneficial to acknowledge the advantages of survey designs, such as the economy of the design, rapid turnaround in data collection, and constraints that preclude you from pursuing other designs (e.g., “An experimental design was not adopted to look at the relationship between overtime hours worked and burnout symptoms because it would be prohibitively difficult, and potentially unethical, to randomly assign nurses to work different amounts of overtime hours.”).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Indicate whether the survey will be cross-sectional&mdash;with the data collected at one point in time&mdash;or whether it will be longitudinal&mdash;with data collected over time.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Specify the form of data collection. Fowler (2014) identified the following types: mail, telephone, the Internet, personal interviews, or group administration (see also Fink, 2016; Krueger &amp; Casey, 2014). Using an Internet survey and administering it online has been discussed extensively in the literature (Nesbary, 2000; Sue &amp; Ritter, 2012). Regardless of the form of data collection, provide a rationale for the procedure, using arguments based on its strengths and weaknesses, costs, data availability, and convenience.</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre_20">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Population and Sample</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">In the method section, follow the type of design with characteristics of the population and the sampling procedure. Methodologists have written excellent discussions about the underlying logic of sampling theory (e.g., Babbie, 2015; Fowler, 2014). Here are essential aspects of the population and sample to describe in a research plan:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">The population.</span> Identify the population in the study. Also state the size of this population, if size can be determined, and the means of identifying individuals in the population. Questions of access arise here, and the researcher might refer to availability of sampling frames&mdash;mail or published lists&mdash;of potential respondents in the population.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Sampling design.</span> Identify whether the sampling design for this population is single stage or multistage (called clustering). Cluster sampling is ideal when it is impossible or impractical to compile a list of the elements composing the population (Babbie, 2015). A single-stage sampling procedure is one in which the researcher has access to names in the population and can sample the people (or other elements) directly. In a multistage or clustering procedure, the researcher first identifies clusters (groups or organizations), obtains names of individuals within those clusters, and then samples within them.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Type of sampling.</span> Identify and discuss the selection process for participants in your sample. Ideally you aim to draw a <span class="italic">random sample,</span> in which each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected (a systematic or probabilistic sample). But in many cases it may be quite difficult (or impossible) to get a random sample of participants. Alternatively, a <span class="italic">systematic sample</span> can have precision-equivalent <span class="bold">random sampling</span> (Fowler, 2014). In this approach, you choose a random start on a list and select every <span class="italic">X</span> numbered person on the list. The <span class="italic">X</span> number is based on a fraction determined by the number of people on the list and the number that are to be selected on the list (e.g., 1 out of every 80th person). Finally, less desirable, but often used, is a nonprobability sample (or <span class="italic">convenience sample</span>), in which respondents are chosen based on their convenience and availability.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Stratification.</span> Identify whether the study will involve <span class="italic">stratification</span> of the population before selecting the sample. This requires that characteristics of the population members be known so that the population can be stratified first before selecting the sample (Fowler, 2014). Stratification means that specific characteristics of individuals (e.g., gender&mdash;females and males) are represented in the sample and the sample reflects the true proportion in the population of individuals with certain characteristics. When randomly selecting people from a population, these characteristics may or may not be present in the sample in the same proportions as in the population; stratification ensures their representation. Also identify the characteristics used in stratifying the population (e.g., gender, income levels, education). Within each stratum, identify whether the sample contains individuals with the characteristic in the same proportion as the characteristic appears in the entire population.</li><a id="calibre_link-281"></a><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Sample size determination.</span> Indicate the number of people in the sample and the procedures used to compute this number. Sample size determination is at its core a tradeoff: A larger sample will provide more accuracy in the inferences made, but recruiting more participants is time consuming and costly. In survey research, investigators sometimes choose a sample size based on selecting a fraction of the population (say, 10%) or selecting a sample size that is typical based on past studies. These approaches are not optimal; instead sample size determination should be based on your analysis plans (Fowler, 2014).</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Power analysis.</span> If your analysis plan consists of detecting a significant association between variables of interest, a power analysis can help you estimate a target sample size. Many free online and commercially available power analysis calculators are available (e.g., G*Power; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007; Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang 2009). The input values for a formal power analysis will depend on the questions you aim to address in your survey design study (for a helpful resource, see Kraemer &amp; Blasey, 2016). As one example, if you aim to conduct a cross-sectional study measuring the correlation between the number of overtime hours worked and burnout symptoms in a sample of emergency room nurses, you can estimate the sample size required to determine whether your correlation significantly differs from zero (e.g., one possible hypothesis is that there will be a significant positive association between number of hours worked and emotional exhaustion burnout symptoms). This power analysis requires just three pieces of information: <ol class="calibre_17"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">An estimate of the size of correlation (<span class="italic">r</span>). A common approach for generating this estimate is to find similar studies that have reported the size of the correlation between hours worked and burnout symptoms. This simple task can often be difficult, either because there are no published studies looking at this association or because suitable published studies do not report a correlation coefficient. One tip: In cases where a published report measures variables of interest to you, one option is to contact the study authors asking them to kindly provide the correlation analysis result from their dataset, for your power analysis.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">A two-tailed alpha value (α). This value is called the Type I error rate and refers to the risk we want to take in saying we have a real non-zero correlation when in fact this effect is not real (and determined by chance), that is, a false positive effect. A commonly accepted alpha value is .05, which refers to a 5% probability (5/100) that we are comfortable making a Type I error, such that 5% of the time we will say that there’s a significant (non-zero) relationship between number of hours worked and burnout symptoms when in fact this effect occurred by chance and is not real.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">A beta value (β). This value is called the Type II error rate and refers to the risk we want to take in saying we do not have a significant effect when in fact there is a significant association, that is, a false negative effect. Researchers commonly try to balance the risks of making Type I versus Type II errors, with a commonly accepted beta value being .20. Power analysis calculators will commonly ask for estimated power, which refers to 1 − beta (1 − .20 = .80).</li></ol></li><a id="calibre_link-366"></a><li value="7" class="calibre_16">You can then plug these numbers into a power analysis calculator to determine the sample size needed. If you assume that the estimated association is <span class="italic">r</span> = .25, with a two-tailed alpha value of .05 and a beta value of .20, the power analysis calculation indicates that you need at least 123 participants in the study you aim to conduct.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">To get some practice, try conducting this sample size determination power analysis. We used the G*Power software program (Faul et al., 2007; Faul et al., 2009), with the following input parameters: <ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Test family: Exact</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Statistical test: Correlation: Bivariate normal model</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Type of power analysis: A priori: Compute required sample size</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Tails: Two</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Correlation ρ H1: .25</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">α err prob: .05</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">Power (1 &ndash; β err prob): .8</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">Correlation ρ H0: 0</li></ul></li><li value="9" class="calibre_16">This power analysis for sample size determination should be done during study planning prior to enrolling any participants. Many scientific journals now require researchers to report a power analysis for sample size determination in the Method section.</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-163" class="calibre_20">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Instrumentation</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">As part of rigorous data collection, the proposal developer also provides detailed information about the actual survey instruments to be used in the study. Consider the following:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Name the survey instruments used to collect data</span>. Discuss whether you used an instrument designed for this research, a modified instrument, or an instrument developed by someone else. For example, if you aim to measure perceptions of stress over the last month, you could use the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983) as your stress perceptions instrument in your survey design. Many survey instruments, including the PSS, can be acquired and used for free as long as you cite the original source of the instrument. But in some cases, researchers have made the use of their instruments proprietary, requiring a fee for use. Instruments are increasingly being delivered through a multitude of online survey products now available (e.g., Qualtrics, Survey Monkey). Although these products can be costly, they also can be quite helpful for accelerating and improving the survey research process. For example, researchers can create their own surveys quickly using custom templates and post them on websites or e-mail them to participants to complete. These software programs facilitate data collection into organized spreadsheets for data analysis, reducing data entry errors and accelerating hypothesis testing.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Validity of scores using the instrument.</span> To use an existing instrument, describe the established validity of scores obtained from past use of the instrument. This means reporting efforts by authors to establish <span class="bold">validity in quantitative research</span>&mdash;whether you can draw meaningful and useful inferences from scores on the instruments. The three traditional forms of validity to look for are (a) content validity (Do the items measure the content they were intended to measure?), (b) predictive or concurrent validity (Do scores predict a criterion measure? Do results correlate with other results?), and (c) <span class="bold">construct validity</span> (Do items measure hypothetical constructs or concepts?). In more recent studies, construct validity has become the overriding objective in validity, and it has focused on whether the scores serve a useful purpose and have positive consequences when they are used in practice (Humbley &amp; Zumbo, 1996). Establishing the validity of the scores in a survey helps researchers to identify whether an instrument might be a good one to use in survey research. This form of validity is different from identifying the threats to validity in experimental research, as discussed later in this chapter.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Reliability of scores on the instrument.</span> Also mention whether scores resulting from past use of the instrument demonstrate acceptable <span class="bold">reliability</span>. Reliability in this context refers to the consistency or repeatability of an instrument. The most important form of reliability for multi-item instruments is the instrument’s <span class="bold">internal consistency</span>&mdash;which is the degree to which sets of items on an instrument behave in the same way. This is important because your instrument scale items should be assessing the same underlying construct, so these items should have suitable intercorrelations. A scale’s internal consistency is quantified by a Cronbach’s alpha (α)value that ranges between 0 and 1, with optimal values ranging between .7 and .9. For example, the 10-item PSS has excellent internal consistency across many published reports, with the original source publication reporting internal consistency values of α = .84&ndash;.86 in three studies (Cohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein, 1983). It can also be helpful to evaluate a second form of instrument reliability, its test-retest reliability. This form of reliability concerns whether the scale is reasonably stable over time with repeated administrations. When you modify an instrument or combine instruments in a study, the original validity and reliability may not hold for the new instrument, and it becomes important to establish validity and reliability during data analysis.</li><a id="calibre_link-298"></a><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Sample items.</span> Include sample items from the instrument so that readers can see the actual items used. In an appendix to the proposal, attach sample items or the entire instrument (or instruments) used.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Content of instrument.</span> Indicate the major content sections in the instrument, such as the cover letter (Dillman, 2007, provides a useful list of items to include in cover letters), the items (e.g., demographics, attitudinal items, behavioral items, factual items), and the closing instructions. Also mention the type of scales used to measure the items on the instrument, such as continuous scales (e.g., <span class="italic">strongly agree</span> to <span class="italic">strongly disagree</span>) and categorical scales (e.g., yes/no, rank from highest to lowest importance).</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Pilot testing.</span> Discuss plans for pilot testing or field-testing the survey and provide a rationale for these plans. This testing is important to establish the content validity of scores on an instrument; to provide an initial evaluation of the internal consistency of the items; and to improve questions, format, and instructions. Pilot testing all study materials also provides an opportunity to assess how long the study will take (and to identify potential concerns with participant fatigue).

Salant and Dillman (1994) suggested a four-phase administration process (see Dillman, 2007, for a similar three-phase process). The first mail-out is a short advance-notice letter to all members of the sample, and the second mail-out is the actual mail survey, distributed about 1 week after the advance-notice letter. The third mail-out consists of a postcard follow-up sent to all members of the sample 4 to 8 days after the initial questionnaire. The fourth mail-out, sent to all nonrespondents, consists of a personalized cover letter with a handwritten signature, the questionnaire, and a preaddressed return envelope with postage. Researchers send this fourth mail-out 3 weeks after the second mail-out. Thus, in total, the researcher concludes the administration period 4 weeks after its start, providing the returns meet project objectives.</li><a id="calibre_link-324"></a></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-164" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Variables in the Study</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Although readers of a proposal learn about the variables in purpose statements and research questions/hypotheses sections, it is useful in the method section to relate the variables to the specific questions or hypotheses on the instrument. One technique is to relate the variables, the research questions or hypotheses, and sample items on the survey instrument so that a reader can easily determine how the data collection connects to the variables and questions/hypotheses. Plan to include a table and a discussion that cross-reference the variables, the questions or hypotheses, and specific survey items.

A table with numbers and percentages describing respondents and nonrespondents is a useful tool to present this information.</p><p id="calibre_link-309" class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Step 2.</span> Discuss the method by which <span class="bold">response bias</span> will be determined. Response bias is the effect of nonresponses on survey estimates (Fowler, 2014). <span class="italic">Bias</span> means that if nonrespondents had responded, their responses would have substantially changed the overall results. Mention the procedures used to check for response bias, such as wave analysis or a respondent/nonrespondent analysis. In wave analysis, the researcher examines returns on select items week by week to determine if average responses change (Leslie, 1972). Based on the assumption that those who return surveys in the final weeks of the response period are nearly all nonrespondents, if the responses begin to change, a potential exists for response bias. An alternative check for response bias is to contact a few nonrespondents by phone and determine if their responses differ substantially from respondents. This constitutes a respondent-nonrespondent check for response bias.</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Step 3.</span> Discuss a plan to provide a <span class="bold">descriptive analysis</span> of data for all independent and dependent variables in the study. This analysis should indicate the means, standard deviations, and range of scores for these variables. Identify whether there is missing data (e.g., some participants may not provide responses to some items or whole scales), and develop plans to report how much missing data is present and whether a strategy will be implemented to replace missing data (for a review, see Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002).</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Step 4.</span> If the proposal contains an instrument with multi-item scales or a plan to develop scales, first evaluate whether it will be necessary to reverse-score items, and then how total scale scores will be calculated. Also mention reliability checks for the internal consistency of the scales (i.e., the Cronbach alpha statistic).</p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Step 5.</span> Identify the statistics and the statistical computer program for testing the major inferential research questions or hypotheses in the proposed study. The <span class="bold">inferential questions or hypotheses</span> relate variables or compare groups in terms of variables so that inferences can be drawn from the sample to a population. Provide a rationale for the choice of statistical test and mention the assumptions associated with the statistic. As shown in <a href="#calibre_link-231">Table 8.3</a>, base this choice on the nature of the research question (e.g., relating variables or comparing groups as the most popular), the number of independent and dependent variables, and the variables used as covariates (e.g., see Rudestam &amp; Newton, 2014). Further, consider whether the variables will be measured on an instrument as a continuous score (e.g., age from 18 to 36) or as a categorical score (e.g., women = 1, men = 2). Finally, consider whether the scores from the sample might be normally distributed in a bell-shaped curve if plotted out on a graph or non-normally distributed. There are additional ways to determine if the scores are normally distributed (see Creswell, 2012). These factors, in combination, enable a researcher to determine what statistical test will be suited for answering the research question or hypothesis. In <a href="#calibre_link-231">Table 8.3</a>, we show how the factors, in combination, lead to the selection of a number of common statistical tests. For additional types of statistical tests, readers are referred to statistics methods books, such as Gravetter and Wallnau (2012).</p><p id="calibre_link-257" class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Step 6.</span> A final step in the data analysis is to present the results in tables or figures and interpret the results from the statistical test, discussed in the <a href="#calibre_link-166">next section</a>.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-166" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Interpreting Results and Writing a Discussion Section</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">An <span class="bold">interpretation in quantitative research</span> means that the researcher draws conclusions from the results for the research questions, hypotheses, and the larger meaning of the results. This interpretation involves several steps:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Report how the results addressed the research question or hypothesis. The <span class="italic">Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</span> (American Psychological Association [APA], 2010) suggests that the most complete meaning of the results come from reporting extensive description, <span class="bold">statistical significance testing</span>, confidence intervals, and effect sizes. Thus, it is important to clarify the meaning of these last three reports of the results. The statistical significance testing reports an assessment as to whether the observed scores reflect a pattern other than chance. A statistical test is considered to be significant if the results are unlikely by chance to have occurred, and the null hypothesis of “no effect” can be rejected. The researcher sets a rejection level of “no effect,” such as <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001, and then assesses whether the test statistic falls into this level of rejection. Typically results will be summarized as “the analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference between men and women in terms of attitudes toward banning smoking in restaurants <span class="italic">F</span> (2, 6) = 8.55, <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Two forms of <span class="italic">practical evidence</span> of the results should also be reported: (a) the effect size and (b) the confidence interval. A <span class="bold">confidence interval</span> is a range of values (an interval) that describes a level of uncertainty around an estimated observed score. A confidence interval shows how good an estimated score might be. A confidence interval of 95%, for example, indicates that 95 out of 100 times the observed score will fall in the range of values. An <span class="bold">effect size</span> identifies the strength of the conclusions about group differences or the relationships among variables in quantitative studies. It is a descriptive statistic that is not dependent on whether the relationship in the data represents the true population. The calculation of effect size varies for different statistical tests: it can be used to explain the variance between two or more variables or the differences among means for groups. It shows the practical significance of the results apart from inferences being applied to the population. <blockquote class="calibre_28">

How do your research findings address gaps in our knowledge base on the topic? It is also important to acknowledge the implications of the findings for practice and for future research in the area. It may also involve discussing theoretical and practical consequences of the results.

These three sequential sections generally are sufficient (often in studies with a few measures, the procedure and measures sections are combined into a single procedure section). In this section of the chapter, we review these components as well as information regarding key features of experimental design and corresponding statistical analyses. As with the section on survey design, the intent here is to highlight key topics to be addressed in an experimental method plan. An overall guide to these topics is found by answering the questions on the checklist shown in <a href="#calibre_link-232">Table 8.4</a>.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-169" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Participants</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Readers need to know about the selection, assignment, and number of participants who will take part in the experiment.

Often investigators aim to recruit a study sample that shares certain characteristics by formally stating specific inclusion and exclusion study criteria when designing their study (e.g., inclusion criterion: participants must be English language speaking; exclusion criterion: participants must not be children under the age of 18). Recruitment approaches are wide-ranging, and can include random digit dialing of households in a community, posting study recruitment flyers or e-mails to targeted communities, or newspaper advertisements.

</blockquote><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">One of the principal features distinguishing an experiment from a survey study design is the use of random assignment. Random assignment is a technique for placing participants into study conditions of a manipulated variable of interest. When individuals are randomly assigned to groups, the procedure is called a <span class="bold">true experiment.</span> If random assignment is used, discuss how and when the study will <span class="italic">randomly assign</span> individuals to treatment groups, which in experimental studies are referred to as levels of an independent variable. This means that of the pool of participants, Individual 1 goes to Group 1, Individual 2 to Group 2, and so forth so that there is no systematic bias in assigning the individuals. This procedure eliminates the possibility of systematic differences among characteristics of the participants that could affect the outcomes so that any differences in outcomes can be attributed to the study’s manipulated variable (or variables) of interest (Keppel &amp; Wickens, 2003). Often experimental studies may be interested in both randomly assigning participants to levels of a <span class="italic">manipulated</span> variable of interest (e.g., a new treatment approach for teaching fractions to children versus the traditional approach) while also <span class="italic">measuring</span> a second predictor variable of interest that cannot utilize random assignment (e.g., measuring whether the treatment benefits are larger among female compared to male children; it is impossible to randomly assign children to be male or female). Designs in which a researcher has only partial (or no) control over randomly assigning participants to levels of a manipulated variable of interest are called <span class="bold">quasi-experiments</span>.</li><a id="calibre_link-282"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Conduct and report a power analysis for sample size determination (for a helpful resource, see Kraemer &amp; Blasey, 2016). The procedures for a sample size power analysis mimic those for a survey design, although the focus shifts to estimating the number of participants needed in each condition of the experiment to detect significant group differences. In this case, the input parameters shift to include an estimate of the effect size referencing the estimated differences between the groups of your manipulated variable(s) of interest and the number of groups in your experiment. Readers are encouraged to review the power analysis section earlier in the survey design portion of this chapter and then consider the following example: <ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Previously we introduced a cross-sectional survey design assessing the relationship between number of overtime hours worked and burnout symptoms among nurses. We might decide to conduct an experiment to test a related question: Do nurses working full time have higher burnout symptoms compared to nurses working part time? In this case, we might conduct an experiment in which nurses are randomly assigned to work either full time (group 1) or part time (group 2) for 2 months, at which time we could measure burnout symptoms. We could conduct a power analysis to evaluate the sample size needed to detect a significant difference in burnout symptoms between these two groups. Previous literature might indicate an effect size difference between these two groups at <span class="italic">d</span> = .5, and as with our survey study design, we can assume a two-tailed alpha = .05 and beta = .20. We ran the calculation again using the G*Power software program (Faul et al., 2007; Faul et al., 2009) to estimate the sample size needed to detect a significant difference between groups: <p class="calibre_">Test family: <span class="italic">t</span> tests</p><p class="calibre_">Statistical test: Means: difference between two independent means (two groups)</p><p class="calibre_">Type of power analysis: A priori: Compute required sample size</p><p class="calibre_">Tails: Two</p><p class="calibre_">Effect size <span class="italic">d</span>: .5</p><p class="calibre_">α err prob: .05</p><p class="calibre_">Power (1 &ndash; β err prob): .8</p><p class="calibre_">Allocation ratio N2/N1: 1</p></li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">With these input parameters, the power analysis indicates a total sample size of 128 participants (64 in each group) is needed in order to detect a significant difference between groups in burnout symptoms.</li></ul></li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">At the end of the participants section, it is helpful to provide a formal experimental design statement that specifies the independent variables and their corresponding levels. For example, a formal design statement might read, “The experiment consisted of a one-way two-groups design comparing burnout symptoms between full-time and part-time nurses.”</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Variables</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">The variables need to be specified in the formal design statement and described (in detail) in the procedure section of the experimental method plan. Here are some suggestions for developing ideas about variables in a proposal:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Clearly identify the independent variables in the experiment (recall the discussion of variables in <a href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter 3</a>) and how they will be manipulated in the study. One common approach is to conduct a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial design in which two independent variables are manipulated in a single experiment. If this is the case, it is important to clarify how and when each independent variable is manipulated.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Include a manipulation check measure that evaluates whether your study successfully manipulated the independent variable(s) of interest. A <span class="bold">manipulation check measure</span> is defined as a measure of the intended manipulated variable of interest. For example, if a study aims to manipulate self-esteem by offering positive test feedback (high self-esteem condition) or negative test feedback (low self-esteem condition) using a performance task, it would be helpful to quantitatively evaluate whether there are indeed self-esteem differences between these two conditions with a manipulation check measure. After this self-esteem study manipulation, a researcher may include a brief measure of state self-esteem as a manipulation check measure prior to administering the primary outcome measures of interest.</li><a id="calibre_link-390"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Identify the dependent variable or variables (i.e., the outcomes) in the experiment. The dependent variable is the response or the criterion variable presumed to be caused by or influenced by the independent treatment conditions. One consideration in the experimental method plan is whether there are multiple ways to measure outcome(s) of interest. For example, if the primary outcome is aggression, it may be possible to collect multiple measures of aggression in your experiment (e.g., a behavioral measure of aggression in response to a provocation, self-reported perceptions of aggression).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Identify other variables to be measured in the study. Three categories of variables are worth mentioning. First, include measures of participant demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity). Second, measure variables that may contribute noise to the study design. For example, self-esteem levels may fluctuate during the day (and relate to the study outcome variables of interest) and so it may be beneficial to measure and record time of day in the study (and then use it as a covariate in study statistical analyses). Third, measure variables that may be potential confounding variables. For example, a critic of the self-esteem manipulation may say that the positive/negative performance feedback study manipulation also unintentionally manipulated rumination, and it was this rumination that is a better explanation for study results on the outcomes of interest. By measuring rumination as a potential confounding variable of interest, the researcher can quantitatively evaluate this critic’s claim.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-171" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Instrumentation and Materials</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Just like in a survey method plan, a sound experimental study plan calls for a thorough discussion about the instruments used&mdash;their development, their items, their scales, and reports of reliability and validity of scores on past uses. However, an experimental study plan also describes in detail the approach for manipulating the independent variables of interest:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Thoroughly discuss the materials used for the manipulated variable(s) of interest. One group, for example, may participate in a special computer-assisted learning plan used by a teacher in a classroom. This plan might involve handouts, lessons, and special written instructions to help students in this experimental group learn how to study a subject using computers. A pilot test of these materials may also be discussed, as well as any training required to administer the materials in a standardized way.</li><a id="calibre_link-373"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Often the researcher does not want participants to know what variables are being manipulated or the condition they have been assigned to (and sometimes what the primary outcome measures of interest are). It is important, then, to draft a <span class="italic">cover story</span> that will be used to explain the study and procedures to participants during the experiment. If any deception is used in the study, it is important to draft a suitable debriefing approach and to get all procedures and materials approved by your institution’s IRB (see <a href="#calibre_link-10">Chapter 4</a>).</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-172" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Experimental Procedures</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">The specific experimental design procedures also need to be identified. This discussion involves indicating the overall experiment type, citing reasons for the design, and advancing a visual model to help the reader understand the procedures.</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Identify the type of experimental design to be used in the proposed study. The types available in experiments are pre-experimental designs, quasi-experiments, and true experiments. With pre-experimental designs, the researcher studies a single group and implements an intervention during the experiment. This design does not have a control group to compare with the experimental group. In quasi-experiments, the investigator uses control and experimental groups, but the design may have partial or total lack of random assignment to groups. In a <span class="italic">true experiment,</span> the investigator randomly assigns the participants to treatment groups. A <span class="bold">single-subject design</span> or <span class="italic">N</span> of 1 design involves observing the behavior of a single individual (or a small number of individuals) over time.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Identify what is being compared in the experiment. In many experiments, those of a type called between-subject designs, the investigator compares two or more groups (Keppel &amp; Wickens, 2003; Rosenthal &amp; Rosnow, 1991). For example, a factorial design experiment, a variation on the between-group design, involves using two or more treatment variables to examine the independent and simultaneous effects of these treatment variables on an outcome (Vogt &amp; Johnson, 2015). This widely used experimental design explores the effects of each treatment separately and also the effects of variables used in combination, thereby providing a rich and revealing multidimensional view. In other experiments, the researcher studies only one group in what is called a within-group design. For example, in a repeated measures design, participants are assigned to different treatments at different times during the experiment. Another example of a within-group design would be a study of the behavior of a single individual over time in which the experimenter provides and withholds a treatment at different times in the experiment to determine its impact. Finally, studies that include both a between-subjects and a within-subjects variable are called mixed designs.</li><a id="calibre_link-345"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Provide a diagram or a figure to illustrate the specific research design to be used.

Although the processes are similar, qualitative methods rely on text and image data, have unique steps in data analysis, and draw on diverse designs. Writing a method section for a proposal or study for qualitative research partly requires educating readers as to the intent of qualitative research, mentioning specific designs, carefully reflecting on the role the researcher plays in the study, drawing from an ever-expanding list of types of data sources, using specific protocols for recording data, analyzing the information through multiple steps of analysis, and mentioning approaches for documenting the methodological integrity or accuracy&mdash;or validity&mdash;of the data collected. This chapter addresses these important components of writing a good qualitative method section into a proposal or study. <a href="#calibre_link-235">Table 9.1</a> presents a checklist for reviewing the qualitative methods section of your project to determine whether you have addressed important topics.</p><blockquote class="calibre_28"><img src="images/000018.jpg" id="calibre_link-235" class="calibre_64" />
</blockquote><p id="calibre_link-393" class="calibre_">The qualitative method section of a proposal requires attention to topics that are similar to a quantitative (or mixed methods) project. These involve telling the reader about the design being used in the study and, in this case, the use of qualitative research and its basic intent. It also involves discussing the sample for the study and the overall data collection and recording procedures. It further expands on the data analysis steps and the methods used for presenting the data, interpreting it, validating it, and indicating the potential outcomes of the study. In contrast to other designs, the qualitative approach includes comments by the researcher about their role and their self-reflection (or reflexivity, it is called), and the specific type of qualitative strategy being used. Further, because the writing structure of a qualitative project may vary considerably from study to study, the method section should also include comments about the nature of the final written product.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-185" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">The Characteristics of Qualitative Research</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">For many years, qualitative writers had to discuss the characteristics of qualitative research and convince faculty and audiences as to their legitimacy. Now these discussions are less frequently found in the literature and there is some consensus as to what constitutes qualitative inquiry. Thus, our suggestions about the method section of a project or proposal are as follows:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Review the needs of potential audiences for the proposal or study. Decide whether audience members are knowledgeable enough about the characteristics of qualitative research that this section is not necessary. For example, although qualitative research is typically accepted and well-known in the social sciences, it has emerged in the health sciences only in the last couple of decades. Thus, for health science audiences, a review of the basic characteristics will be important.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">If there is some question about the audience’s knowledge, present the basic characteristics of qualitative research and consider discussing a recent qualitative research journal article (or study) to use as an example to illustrate the characteristics.</li><a id="calibre_link-312"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16">If you present the basic characteristics, what ones should you mention? A number of authors of introductory texts convey these characteristics, such as Creswell (2016), Hatch (2002), and Marshall and Rossman (2016). <ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Natural setting:</span> Qualitative researchers tend to collect data in the field at the site where participants experience the issue or problem under study. Researchers do not bring individuals into a lab (a contrived situation), nor do they typically send out instruments for individuals to complete. This up-close information gathered by actually talking directly to people and seeing them behave and act within their context is a major characteristic of qualitative research. In the natural setting, the researchers have face-to-face interaction, often extending over a prolonged period of time.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Researcher as key instrument:</span> Qualitative researchers collect data themselves through examining documents, observing behavior, or interviewing participants. They may use a protocol&mdash;an instrument for recording data&mdash;but the researchers are the ones who actually gather the information and interpret it. They do not tend to use or rely on questionnaires or instruments developed by other researchers.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Multiple sources of data:</span> Qualitative researchers typically gather multiple forms of data, such as interviews, observations, documents, and audiovisual information rather than rely on a single data source. These are all open-ended forms of data in which the participants share their ideas freely, not constrained by predetermined scales or instruments. Then the researchers review all of the data, make sense of it, and organize it into codes and themes that cut across all of the data sources.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Inductive and deductive data analysis:</span> Qualitative researchers typically work inductively, building patterns, categories, and themes from the bottom up by organizing the data into increasingly more abstract units of information. This inductive process illustrates working back and forth between the themes and the database until the researchers have established a comprehensive set of themes. Then deductively, the researchers look back at their data from the themes to determine if more evidence can support each theme or whether they need to gather additional information. Thus, while the process begins inductively, deductive thinking also plays an important role as the analysis moves forward.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Participants’ meanings:</span> In the entire qualitative research process, the researchers keep a focus on learning the meaning that the participants hold about the problem or issue, not the meaning that the researchers bring to the research or that writers express in the literature.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Emergent design:</span> The research process for qualitative researchers is emergent. This means that the initial plan for research cannot be tightly prescribed, and some or all phases of the process may change or shift after the researcher enters the field and begins to collect data. For example, the questions may change, the forms of data collection may shift, and the individuals studied and the sites visited may be modified. These shifts signal that the researchers are delving deeper and deeper into the topic or the phenomenon under study. The key idea behind qualitative research is to learn about the problem or issue from participants and to address the research to obtain that information.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Reflexivity:</span> In qualitative research, inquirers reflect about how their role in the study and their personal background, culture, and experiences hold potential for shaping their interpretations, such as the themes they advance and the meaning they ascribe to the data. This aspect of the methods is more than merely advancing biases and values in the study, but how the background of the researchers actually may shape the direction of the study.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Holistic account:</span> Qualitative researchers try to develop a complex picture of the problem or issue under study. This involves reporting multiple perspectives, identifying the many factors involved in a situation, and generally sketching the larger picture that emerges. This larger picture is not necessarily a linear model of cause and effect but rather a model of multiple factors interacting in different ways. This picture, qualitative researchers would say, mirrors real life and the ways that events operate in the real world. A visual model of many facets of a process or a central phenomenon aids in establishing this holistic picture (see, for example, Creswell &amp; Brown, 1992).</li></ul></li><a id="calibre_link-286"></a></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-186" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Qualitative Designs</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Beyond these general characteristics are more specific approaches (i.e., strategies of inquiry, designs, or procedures) in conducting qualitative research (Creswell &amp; Poth, 2018). These approaches have emerged in the field of qualitative <a id="calibre_link-294"></a>research since it has matured in the social sciences since the early 1990s. They include procedures for data collection, analysis, and writing, but they originated out of disciplines in the social sciences. Many approaches exist, such as the 28 identified by Tesch (1990), the 22 types in Wolcott’s (2009) tree, and the five approaches to qualitative inquiry by Creswell and Poth (2018), and Creswell (2016). Marshall and Rossman (2016) discussed five types common across five different authors. As mentioned in <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter 1</a>, we recommend that qualitative researchers choose from among the possibilities, such as narrative, phenomenology, ethnography, case study, and grounded theory. We selected these five because they are popular across the social and health sciences today. Others exist that have been addressed adequately in qualitative books, such as participatory action research (Kemmis &amp; Wilkinson, 1998), discourse analysis (Cheek, 2004), or participatory action research (Ivankova, 2015). In these approaches, researchers study individuals (narrative, phenomenology); explore processes, activities, and events (case study, grounded theory); or learn about broad culture-sharing behavior of individuals or groups (ethnography).</p><p class="calibre_">In writing a procedure for a qualitative proposal, consider the following <span class="bold">research tips</span>:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Identify the specific approach that you will be using and provide references to the literature that discusses the approach.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Provide some background information about the approach, such as its discipline origin, the applications of it (preferably to your field), and a brief definition of it (see <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter 1</a> for the five approaches or designs).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Discuss why it is an appropriate strategy to use in the proposed study.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Identify how the use of the approach will shape many aspects of the design process, such as the title, the problem, the research questions, the data collection and analysis, and the report write-up.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-187" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">The Researcher’s Role and Reflexivity</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">As mentioned in the list of characteristics, qualitative research is interpretative research; the inquirer is typically involved in a sustained and intensive experience with participants. This introduces a range of strategic, ethical, and personal issues into the qualitative research process (Locke, Spirduso, &amp; Silverman, 2013). With these concerns in mind, inquirers explicitly identify reflexively their biases, values, and personal background, such as gender, history, culture, and socioeconomic status (SES) that shape their interpretations formed during a study. In addition, gaining entry to a research site and the ethical issues that might arise are also elements of the researcher’s role.</p><p id="calibre_link-313" class="calibre_">Reflexivity requires commenting on two important points:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Past experiences.</span> Include statements about past experiences with the research problem or with the participants or setting that help the reader understand the connection between the researchers and the study. These experiences may involve participation in the setting, past educational or work experiences, or culture, ethnicity, race, SES, or other demographics that tie the researchers directly to the study.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">How past experiences shape interpretations.</span> Be explicit, then, about how these experiences may potentially shape the interpretations the researchers make during the study. For example, the experiences may cause researchers to lean toward certain themes, to actively look for evidence to support their positions, and to create favorable or unfavorable conclusions about the sites or participants.</li></ul><p class="calibre_">How can reflexive thinking be incorporated into your qualitative study (Creswell, 2016)? You can write notes about your personal experiences during the study. These notes might include observations about the process of data collection, hunches about what you are learning, and concerns about reactions of participants to the research process. These ideas can be written as <span class="bold">memos</span>&mdash;notes written during the research process that reflect on the process or that help shape the development of codes and themes. In writing these reflective notes, how do you know whether you are being sufficiently reflexive for a qualitative study? Sufficient reflexivity occurs when researchers record notes during the process of research, reflect on their own personal experiences, and consider how their personal experiences may shape their interpretation of results. Also, qualitative researchers need to limit their discussions about personal experiences so that they do not override the importance of the content or methods in a study.</p><p class="calibre_">Another aspect of reflecting on the role of the researcher is to be aware of connections between the researcher and the participants or the research sites that may unduly influence the researcher’s interpretations. “Backyard” research (Glesne &amp; Peshkin, 1992) involves studying the researcher’s own organization, or friends, or immediate work setting. This often leads to compromises in the researcher’s ability to disclose information and raises issues of an imbalance of power between the inquirer and the participants. When researchers collect data at their own workplaces (or when they are in a superior role to participants), the information may be convenient and easy to collect, but it may not be accurate information and it may jeopardize the roles of the researchers and the participants. If studying the backyard is essential, then the researcher is responsible for showing how the data will not be compromised and how such information will not place the participants (or the researchers) at risk. In addition, multiple strategies for <a id="calibre_link-276"></a>validation (see approaches to validation later in this chapter) are necessary to demonstrate the accuracy of the information.</p><p class="calibre_">Further, indicate steps taken to obtain permission from the institutional review board (IRB) (see <a href="#calibre_link-10">Chapter 4</a>) to protect the rights of human participants. Attach, as an appendix, the approval letter from the IRB and discuss the process involved in securing permissions. Discuss steps taken to gain entry to the setting and to secure permissions to study the participants or situation (Marshall &amp; Rossman, 2016). It is important to gain access to research or archival sites by seeking the approval of <span class="bold">gatekeepers,</span> individuals at the site who provide access to the site and allow or permit the research to be done. A brief proposal might need to be developed and submitted for review to gatekeepers. Bogdan and Biklen (1992) advanced topics that could be addressed in such a proposal:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Why was the site chosen for study?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">What activities will occur at the site during the research study?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Will the study be disruptive?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">How will the results be reported?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">What will the gatekeeper gain from the study?</li></ul><p class="calibre_">Comment about sensitive ethical issues that may arise (see <a href="#calibre_link-10">Chapter 4</a>). For each issue raised, discuss how the research study will address it. For example, when studying a sensitive topic, it is necessary to mask names of people, places, and activities. In this situation, the process for masking information requires discussion in the proposal.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-188" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Data Collection Procedures</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Comments about the role of the researcher set the stage for discussion of issues involved in collecting data. The data collection steps include setting the boundaries for the study through sampling and recruitment; collecting information through unstructured or semi-structured observations and interviews, documents, and visual materials; as well as establishing the protocol for recording information.</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Identify the purposefully selected sites or individuals for the proposed study. The idea behind qualitative research is to <span class="bold">purposefully select</span> participants or sites (or documents or visual material) that will best help the researcher understand the problem and the research question. This does not necessarily suggest random sampling or selection of a large number of participants and sites, as is typically found in quantitative research. A discussion of participants and the site might include four aspects identified by Miles and Huberman (1994): (a) the setting (i.e., where the research will take place), (b) the actors (i.e., who will be observed or interviewed), (c) the events (i.e., what the actors will be observed or interviewed doing), and (d) the process (i.e., the evolving nature of events undertaken by the actors within the setting).</li><a id="calibre_link-293"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Discuss the strategies being used to recruit individual (or cases) to the study. This is a challenging aspect of research. Indicate ways of informing appropriate participants about the study, and cite the actual recruitment messages sent to them. Discuss ways to provide incentives for individuals to participate, and reflect on approaches that will be used if one method of recruitment is not successful.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Comment on the number of participants and sites involved in the research. Aside from the small number that characterizes qualitative research, how many sites and participants should you have? First of all, there is no specific answer to this question; the literature contains a variety of perspectives (e.g., see Creswell &amp; Poth, 2018). Sample size depends on the qualitative design being used (e.g., ethnography, case study). From a review of many qualitative research studies, we have some rough estimates to advance. Narrative includes one or two individuals; phenomenology involves a range of 3&ndash;10; grounded theory, 20&ndash;30; ethnography examines one single culture-sharing group with numerous artifacts, interviews, and observations; and case studies include about four to five cases. This is certainly one approach to the sample size issue. Another approach is equally viable. The idea of <span class="bold">saturation</span> comes from grounded theory. Charmaz (2006) said that one stops collecting data when the categories (or themes) are saturated: when gathering fresh data no longer sparks new insights or reveals new properties. This is when you have an adequate sample.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Indicate the type or types of data to be collected. In many qualitative studies, inquirers collect multiple forms of data and spend a considerable time in the natural setting gathering information. The collection procedures in qualitative research involve four basic types and their strengths and limitations, as shown in <a href="#calibre_link-236">Table 9.2</a>. <ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">A <span class="bold">qualitative observation</span> is when the researcher takes field notes on the behavior and activities of individuals at the research site. In these field notes, the researcher records, in an unstructured or semi-structured way (using some prior questions that the inquirer wants to know), activities at the research site. Qualitative observers may also engage in roles varying from a nonparticipant to a complete participant. Typically these observations are open-ended in that the researchers ask general questions of the participants allowing the participants to freely provide their views.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">In <span class="bold">qualitative interviews,</span> the researcher conducts face-to-face interviews with participants, telephone interviews, or engages in focus group interviews with six to eight interviewees in each group. These interviews involve unstructured and generally open-ended questions that are few in number and intended to elicit views and opinions from the participants.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">During the process of research, the investigator may collect <span class="bold">qualitative documents</span>. These may be public documents (e.g., newspapers, minutes of meetings, official reports) or private documents (e.g., personal journals and diaries, letters, e-mails).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">A final category of qualitative data consists of <span class="bold">qualitative audiovisual and digital materials</span> (including social media materials). This data may take the form of photographs, art objects, videotapes, website main pages, e-mails, text messages, social media text, or any forms of sound. Include creative data collection procedures that fall under the category of visual ethnography (Pink, 2001) and which might include living stories, metaphorical visual narratives, and digital archives (Clandinin, 2007).</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">In a discussion about data collection forms, be specific about the types and include arguments concerning the strengths and weaknesses of each type, as discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-236">Table 9.2</a>. Typically, in good qualitative research the researchers draw on multiple sources of qualitative data to make interpretations about a research problem.</li></ul></li><a id="calibre_link-297"></a><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Include data collection types that go beyond typical observations and interviews. These unusual forms create reader interest in a proposal and can capture useful information that observations and interviews may miss. For example, examine the compendium of types of data in <a href="#calibre_link-237">Table 9.3</a> that can be used, to stretch the imagination about possibilities, such as gathering sounds or tastes, or using cherished items to elicit comments during an interview. Such stretching will be viewed positively by graduate committee members and by editors of journals.</li></ul><blockquote id="calibre_link-236" class="calibre_28">

Researchers often engage in multiple observations during the course of a qualitative study and use an <span class="bold">observational protocol</span> for recording information while observing. This may be a single page with a dividing line down the middle to separate descriptive notes (portraits of the participants, a reconstruction of dialogue, a description of the physical setting, accounts of particular events, or activities) from reflexive notes (the researcher’s personal thoughts, such as “speculation, feelings, problems, ideas, hunches, impressions, and prejudices”; Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 1992, p. 121). Also written on this form might be demographic information about the time, place, and date of the field setting where the observation takes place.</li><a id="calibre_link-277"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Interview protocol.</span> Plan to develop and use an <span class="bold">interview protocol</span> for asking questions and recording answers during a qualitative interview. Researchers record information from interviews by making handwritten notes, by audiotaping, or by videotaping. Even if an interview is taped, we recommend that researchers take notes in the event that recording equipment fails. If audiotaping is used, researchers need to plan in advance for the transcription of the tape.</li></ul><p class="calibre_">The interview protocol should be about two pages in length. There should be some spaces between the questions for the interviewer to write short notes and quotes in case the audio-recording device does not work. The total number of questions should be somewhere between 5 and 10, although no precise number can be given. It should be prepared in advance of the interview, and used consistently in all of the interviews. It is helpful for the interviewer to memorize the questions so that he or she does not appear to be simply reading the interview protocol. The interview protocol consists of several important components. These are basic information about the interview, an introduction, the interview content questions with probes, and closing instructions (see also Creswell, 2016). See <a href="#calibre_link-238">Figure 9.1</a>.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-190" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Data Analysis Procedures</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">A methods discussion in a qualitative proposal or study needs also to specify the steps in analyzing the various forms of qualitative data. In general, the intent is to make sense out of text and image data. It involves segmenting and taking apart the data (like peeling back the layers of an onion) as well as putting it back together. The discussion in your study about qualitative data analysis might begin with several general points about the overall process:</p><p id="calibre_link-238" class="calibre_1"></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 9.1</span> Sample Interview Protocol</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000042.jpg" class="calibre_67" /></p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Simultaneous procedures.</span> Data analysis in qualitative research will proceed hand-in-hand with other parts of developing the qualitative study, namely, the data collection and the write-up of findings. While interviews are going on, for example, researchers may be analyzing an interview collected earlier, writing memos that may ultimately be included as a narrative in the final report, and organizing the structure of the final report. This process is unlike quantitative research in which the investigator collects the data, then analyzes the information, and finally writes the report.</li><a id="calibre_link-334"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Winnowing the data.</span> Because text and image data are so dense and rich, all of the information cannot be used in a qualitative study. Thus, in the analysis of the data, researchers need to “winnow” the data (Guest, MacQueen, &amp; Namey, 2012), a process of focusing in on some of the data and disregarding other parts of it. This process, too, is different from quantitative research in which researchers go to great lengths to preserve all of the data and reconstruct or replace missing data. In qualitative research, the impact of this process is to aggregate data into a small number of themes, something between five and seven themes (Creswell, 2013).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Using qualitative computer software programs for assistance.</span> Also specify whether you will use a qualitative computer data analysis program to assist you in analyzing the data (or whether you will hand code the data). Hand coding is a laborious and time-consuming process, even for data from a few individuals. Thus, qualitative software programs have become quite popular, and they help researchers organize, sort, and search for information in text or image databases (see Guest and colleagues’ [2012] chapter on qualitative data analysis software). Several excellent computer software programs are available, and they have similar features: good tutorials and demonstration files, the ability to incorporate both text and image (e.g., photographs) data, the features of storing and organizing data, the search capacity of locating all text associated with specific codes, interrelated codes for making queries of the relationship among codes, and the import and export of qualitative data to <span class="italic">quantitative</span> programs, such as spreadsheets or data analysis programs. The basic idea behind these programs is that using the computer is an efficient means for storing and locating qualitative data. Although the researcher still needs to go through each line of text (as in hand coding by going through transcriptions) and assign codes, this process may be faster and more efficient than hand coding. Also, in large databases, the researcher can quickly locate all passages (or text segments) coded the same and determine whether participants are responding to a code idea in similar or different ways. Beyond this, the computer program can facilitate relating different codes (e.g., How do males and females&mdash;the first code of <span class="italic">gender</span>&mdash;differ in terms of their <span class="italic">attitudes to smoking</span>&mdash;a second code?). These are just a few features of the software programs that make them a logical choice for qualitative data analysis over hand coding. As with any software program, qualitative software programs require time and skill to learn and employ effectively, although books for learning the programs are widely available. Demos are available for six popular qualitative data analysis software programs: MAXqda (<a href="http://www.maxqda.com/">www.maxqda.com/</a>), Atlas.ti (<a href="http://www.atlasti.com">www.atlasti.com</a>), Provalis and QDA Miner (<a href="https://provalisresearch.com/">https://provalisresearch.com/</a>), Dedoose (<a href="http://www.dedoose.com/">www.dedoose.com/</a>), and QSR NVivo (<a href="http://www.qsrinternational.com/">www.qsrinternational.com/</a>). These programs are available for both the PC and MAC platforms.</li><a id="calibre_link-357"></a><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Overview of the data analysis process</span> (see <a href="#calibre_link-239">Figure 9.2</a>). As a <span class="bold">research tip</span>, we urge researchers to look at qualitative data analysis as a process that requires sequential steps to be followed, from the specific to the general, and involving multiple levels of analysis: <ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 1.</span>
<span class="italic">Organize and prepare the data for analysis</span>. This involves transcribing interviews, optically scanning material, typing up field notes, cataloguing all of the visual material, and sorting and arranging the data into different types depending on the sources of information.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 2.</span>
<span class="italic">Read or look at all the data</span>. This first step provides a general sense of the information and an opportunity to reflect on its overall meaning. What general ideas are participants saying? What is the tone of the ideas? What is the impression of the overall depth, credibility, and use of the information? Sometimes qualitative researchers write notes in margins of transcripts or observational field notes, or start recording general thoughts about the data at this stage. For visual data, a sketchbook of ideas can begin to take shape.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 3.</span>
<span class="italic">Start coding all of the data</span>. <span class="bold">Coding</span> is the process of organizing the data by bracketing chunks (or text or image segments) and writing a word representing a category in the margins (Rossman &amp; Rallis, 2012). It involves taking text data or pictures gathered during data collection, segmenting sentences (or paragraphs) or images into categories, and labeling those categories with a term, often based in the actual language of the participant (called an <span class="italic">in vivo</span> term). <p class="calibre_1"></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 9.2</span> Data Analysis in Qualitative Research</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000033.jpg" class="calibre_68" /></p></li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 4.</span>
<span class="italic">Generate a description and themes.</span> Use the coding process to generate a description of the setting or people as well as categories or themes for analysis. <span class="italic">Description</span> involves a detailed rendering of information about people, places, or events in a setting. Researchers can generate codes for this description. This analysis is useful in designing detailed descriptions for case studies, ethnographies, and narrative research projects. Use the coding as well for generating a small number of <span class="italic">themes</span> or categories&mdash;perhaps five to seven themes for a research study. These themes are the ones that appear as major findings in qualitative studies and are often used as headings in the findings sections of studies (or in the findings section of a dissertation or thesis). They should display multiple perspectives from individuals and be supported by diverse quotations and specific evidence. Beyond identifying the themes during the coding process, qualitative researchers can do much with themes to build additional layers of complex analysis. For example, researchers interconnect themes into a story line (as in narratives) or develop them into a theoretical model (as in grounded theory). Themes are analyzed for each individual case and across different cases (as in case studies) or shaped into a general description (as in phenomenology). Sophisticated qualitative studies go beyond description and theme identification and form complex theme connections.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 5.</span>
<span class="italic">Representing the description and themes.</span> Advance how the description and themes will be <span class="italic">represented</span> in the qualitative narrative. The most popular approach is to use a narrative passage to convey the findings of the analysis. This might be a discussion that mentions a chronology of events, the detailed discussion of several themes (complete with subthemes, specific illustrations, multiple perspectives from individuals, and quotations) or a discussion with interconnecting themes. Many qualitative researchers also use visuals, figures, or tables as adjuncts to the discussions. They present a process model (as in grounded theory), advance a drawing of the specific research site (as in ethnography), or convey descriptive information about each participant in a table (as in case studies and ethnographies).</li></ul></li><a id="calibre_link-239"></a><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Specific coding procedures.</span> As shown in <a href="#calibre_link-240">Table 9.4</a>, Tesch (1990) provided the eight steps typically used in forming codes. In addition, give some attention to the types of codes to develop when analyzing a text transcript or a picture (or other type of visual object). <p class="calibre_">We tend to think about codes as falling into three categories:</p><ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Expected codes.</span> Code on topics that readers would expect to find, based on the literature and common sense. When studying bullying in the schools, we might code some segments as “attitudes toward oneself.” This code would be expected in a study about bullying in the schools.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Surprising codes.</span> Code on findings that are surprising and could not be anticipated before the study began. In a study of leadership in nonprofit organizations, we might learn about the impact of geo-warming on the building of the organization and how this shapes the location and proximity of individuals to one another. Without going out to the building before the study begins and looking at it, we would not necessarily think about the codes of geo-warming and location of offices in my study of leadership.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Codes of unusual or of conceptual interest.</span> Code unusual ideas, and those that are, in and of themselves, of conceptual interest to readers. We will use one of the codes that we discovered in our qualitative study of a campus’s response to a gunman (Asmussen &amp; Creswell, 1995). We did not anticipate the code “retriggering” to emerge in our study, and it surfaced from the perspective of a psychologist called into the campus to assess the response. The fact that individuals were reminded of past traumatic incidents&mdash;retriggering&mdash;prompted us to use the term as an important code and ultimately a theme in our analysis. <blockquote class="calibre_28">
<img src="images/000022.jpg" class="calibre_58" />
</blockquote></li><li value="4" class="calibre_60"><span class="italic">On using predetermined codes.</span> Another issue about coding is whether the researcher should (a) develop codes <span class="italic">only</span> on the basis of the emerging information collected from participants, (b) use predetermined codes and then fit the data to them, or (c) use some combination of emerging and predetermined codes. The traditional approach in the social sciences is to allow the codes to emerge during the data analysis. In the health sciences, a popular approach is to use predetermined codes based on the theory being examined. In this case, the researchers might develop a <span class="bold">qualitative codebook,</span> a table that contains a list of predetermined codes that researchers use for coding the data. Guest and colleagues (2012) discussed and illustrated the use of codebooks in qualitative research. The intent of a codebook is to provide definitions for codes and to maximize coherence among codes&mdash;especially when multiple coders are involved. This codebook would provide a list of codes, a code label for each code, a brief definition of it, a full definition of it, information about when to use the code and when not to use it, and an example of a quote illustrating the code. This codebook can evolve and change during a study based on close analysis of the data when the researcher is not starting from an emerging code perspective. For researchers who have a distinct theory they want to test in their projects, we would recommend developing a preliminary codebook for coding the data and then permitting the codebook to develop and change based on the information learned during the data analysis.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Coding visual images.</span> As mentioned earlier, visual data are becoming used more frequently in qualitative research. These data sources represent images drawn from photographs, videos, film, and drawing (Creswell, 2016). Participants might be handed a camera and asked to take pictures of what they see. Alternatively, they may be asked to draw a picture of the phenomenon under study, or reflect on a favorite picture or object that would elicit responses. Challenges in using visual images do arise in qualitative research. Images may reflect trends of the culture or society rather than the perspectives of a single individual. It is difficult to respect anonymity when images of individuals and places represent qualitative data. Permissions are needed to respect the privacy of individuals providing visual data. <p class="calibre_">Despite these concerns, once the qualitative researcher obtains the visual data, the process of coding comes into play. These steps often follow this procedure:</p><ul class="calibre_69"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 1.</span> Prepare your data or analysis. If hand coding, print each image with a wide margin (or affix it to a larger piece of paper) to allow space to assign the code labels. If using a computer, import all images into the application.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 2.</span> Code the image by tagging areas of the image and assigning code labels. Some codes might involve meta-details (e.g., the camera angle).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 3.</span> Compile all of the codes for the images on a separate sheet.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 4.</span> Review the codes to eliminate redundancy and overlap. This step also begins to reduce the codes to potential themes.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 5.</span> Group codes into themes that represent a common idea.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 6.</span> Assign the codes/themes to three groups: expected codes/themes, surprising codes/themes, and unusual codes/themes. This step helps to ensure the qualitative “findings” will represent diverse perspectives.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 7.</span> Array the codes/themes into a conceptual map that shows the flow of ideas in the “findings” section. The flow might represent presenting the themes from a more general picture to a more specific picture.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Step 8.</span> Write the narrative for each theme that will go into the “findings” section of a study or for a general summary that will go into the “discussion” section as the overall findings in the study. (Creswell, 2016, pp. 169&ndash;170).</li></ul></li><li value="6" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Further data analysis by type of approach.</span> A helpful conceptualization to advance in the method section is that qualitative data analysis will proceed on two layers: (a) the first basic layer is the more general procedure (see above) in analyzing the data, and (b) the second more advanced layer would be the analysis steps embedded within specific qualitative designs. For example, narrative research employs restorying the participants’ stories using structural devices, such as plot, setting, activities, climax, and denouement (Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000). Phenomenological research uses the analysis of significant statements, the generation of meaning units, and the development of what Moustakas (1994) called an essence description. Grounded theory has systematic steps (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2015; Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990, 1998). These involve generating categories of information (open coding), selecting one of the categories and positioning it within a theoretical model (axial coding), and then explicating a story from the interconnection of these categories (selective coding). Case study and ethnographic research involve a detailed description of the setting or individuals, followed by analysis of the data for themes or issues (see Stake, 1995; Wolcott, 1994). A complete description of the data analysis in a proposal, when the inquirer is using one of these strategies, would be to first describe the general process of analysis followed by the specific steps within the strategy.</li></ul></li><a id="calibre_link-240"></a></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-191" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Interpretation</span></span></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Interpretation in qualitative research</span> involves several procedures: summarizing the overall findings, comparing the findings to the literature, discussing a personal view of the findings, and stating limitations and future research. In terms of overall findings, the question “What were the lessons learned?” captures the essence of this idea (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985). These lessons could be the researcher’s personal interpretation, couched in the understanding that the inquirer brings to the study from a personal culture, history, and experiences.</p><p id="calibre_link-314" class="calibre_">It could also be a meaning derived from a comparison of the findings with information gleaned from the literature or theories. In this way, authors suggest that the findings confirm past information or diverge from it. It can also suggest new questions that need to be asked&mdash;questions raised by the data and analysis that the inquirer had not foreseen earlier in the study. Ethnographers can end a study, Wolcott (1994) said, by stating further questions. The questioning approach is also used in transformative approaches to qualitative research. Moreover, when qualitative researchers use a theoretical lens, they can form interpretations that call for action agendas for reform and change. Researchers might describe how the narrative outcome will be compared with theories and the general literature on the topic. In many qualitative articles, researchers also discuss the literature at the end of the study (see <a href="#calibre_link-8">Chapter 2</a>). Thus, interpretation in qualitative research can take many forms; be adapted for different types of designs; and be flexible to convey personal, research-based, and action meanings.</p><p class="calibre_">Finally, part of interpretation involves suggesting limitations in a project and advancing future research directions. Limitations often attach to the methods of a study (e.g., inadequate sample size, difficulty in recruitment), and they represent weaknesses in the research that the author acknowledges so that future studies will not suffer from the same problems. Suggestions for future research propose research themes that studies might address to advance the literature, to remedy some of the weaknesses in the present study, or to advance new leads or directions that can point to useful applications or knowledge.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-192" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Validity and Reliability</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Although validation of findings occurs throughout the steps in the research process, this discussion focuses on how the researcher writes a passage in a proposal or study on the procedures to be undertaken to validate the proposed study’s findings. Researchers need to convey the steps they will take in their studies to check for the accuracy and credibility of their findings. Validity does not carry the same connotations in qualitative research that it does in quantitative research; nor is it a companion to reliability (examining stability) or generalizability (the external validity of applying results to new settings, people, or samples), topics discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-15">Chapter 8</a>. <span class="bold">Qualitative validity</span> means that the researcher checks for the accuracy of the findings by employing certain procedures, whereas <span class="bold">qualitative reliability</span> indicates that the researcher’s approach is consistent across different researchers and among different projects (Gibbs, 2007).</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Defining qualitative validity.</span> Validity is one of the strengths of qualitative research and is based on determining whether the findings are accurate from the standpoint of the researcher, the participant, or the readers of an account (Creswell &amp; Miller, 2000). Terms abound in the qualitative literature that address validity, such as <span class="italic">trustworthiness, authenticity</span>, and <span class="italic">credibility</span> (Creswell &amp; Miller, 2000), and it is a much-discussed topic (Lincoln, Lynham, &amp; Guba, 2011).</li><a id="calibre_link-315"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Using multiple validity procedures.</span> A procedural perspective that we recommend for research proposals is to identify and discuss one or more strategies available to check the accuracy of the findings. Researchers should actively incorporate <span class="bold">validity strategies</span> into their proposals. We recommend the use of multiple approaches, which should enhance the researcher’s ability to assess the accuracy of findings as well as convince readers of that accuracy. There are eight primary strategies, organized from those used most frequently and easiest to implement to those used occasionally and more difficult to implement: <ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Triangulate</span> different data sources by examining evidence from the sources and using it to build a coherent justification for themes. If themes are established based on converging several sources of data or perspectives from participants, then this process can be claimed as adding to the validity of the study.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Use <span class="italic">member checking</span> to determine the accuracy of the qualitative findings by taking the final report or specific descriptions or themes back to participants and determining whether these participants feel that they are accurate. This does not mean taking back the raw transcripts to check for accuracy; instead, the researcher takes back parts of the polished or semi-polished product, such as the major findings, the themes, the case analysis, the grounded theory, the cultural description, and so forth. This procedure can involve conducting a follow-up interview with participants in the study and providing an opportunity for them to comment on the findings.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">Use a <span class="italic">rich, thick description</span> to convey the findings. This description may transport readers to the setting and give the discussion an element of shared experiences. When qualitative researchers provide detailed descriptions of the setting, for example, or offer many perspectives about a theme, the results become more realistic and richer. This procedure can add to the validity of the findings.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Clarify the <span class="italic">bias</span> the researcher brings to the study. This self-reflection creates an open and honest narrative that will resonate well with readers. Reflexivity has already been mentioned as a core characteristic of qualitative research. Good qualitative research contains comments by the researchers about how their interpretation of the findings is shaped by their background, such as their gender, culture, history, and socioeconomic origin.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16">Present <span class="italic">negative</span> or <span class="italic">discrepant information</span> that runs counter to the themes. Because real life is composed of different perspectives that do not always coalesce, discussing contrary information adds to the credibility of an account. A researcher can accomplish this by discussing evidence about a theme. Most evidence will build a case for the theme; researchers can also present information that contradicts the general perspective of the theme. By presenting this contradictory evidence, the account becomes more realistic and more valid.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16">Spend <span class="italic">prolonged time</span> in the field. In this way, the researcher develops an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon under study and can convey detail about the site and the people that lends credibility to the narrative account. The more experience that a researcher has with participants in their settings, the more accurate or valid will be the findings.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_16">Use <span class="italic">peer debriefing</span> to enhance the accuracy of the account. This process involves locating a person (a peer debriefer) who reviews and asks questions about the qualitative study so that the account will resonate with people other than the researcher. This strategy&mdash;involving an interpretation beyond the researcher and invested in another person&mdash;adds validity to an account.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_16">Use an <span class="italic">external auditor</span> to review the entire project. As distinct from a peer debriefer, this auditor is not familiar with the researcher or the project and can provide an objective assessment of the project throughout the process of research or at the conclusion of the study. The role is similar to that of a fiscal auditor, and specific questions exist that auditors might ask (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985). The procedure of having an independent investigator look over many aspects of the project (e.g., accuracy of transcription, the relationship between the research questions and the data, the level of data analysis from the raw data through interpretation) enhances the overall validity of a qualitative study.</li></ul></li><a id="calibre_link-330"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Using qualitative reliability.</span> How do qualitative researchers check to determine if their approaches are reliable (i.e., consistent or stable)? Yin (2009) suggested that qualitative researchers need to document the procedures of their case studies and to document as many of the steps of the procedures as possible. He also recommended setting up a detailed case study protocol and database, so that others can follow the procedures. Gibbs (2007) suggested several qualitative reliability procedures: <ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">Check transcripts to make sure that they do not contain obvious mistakes made during transcription.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Make sure that there is not a drift in the definition of codes, a shift in the meaning of the codes during the process of coding. This can be accomplished by continually comparing data with the codes and by writing memos about the codes and their definitions (see the discussion on a qualitative codebook).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">For team research, coordinate the communication among the coders by regular documented meetings and by sharing the analysis.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Cross-check codes developed by different researchers by comparing results that are derived independently. Proposal writers need to include several of these procedures as evidence that they will have consistent results in their proposed study. We recommend that several procedures be mentioned in a proposal and that single researchers find another person who can cross-check their codes for what is called <span class="bold">intercoder agreement</span> (or cross-checking) (also see Guest et al., 2012; Creswell, 2016). Such an agreement might be based on whether two or more coders agree on codes used for the same passages in the text. It is not that they code the same passage of text; rather they determine whether another coder would code it with the same or a similar code. Reliability subprograms in qualitative computer software packages can then be used to determine the level of consistency of coding. Miles and Huberman (1994) recommended that the consistency of the coding be in agreement at least 80% of the time for good qualitative reliability.</li></ul></li><a id="calibre_link-290"></a><li value="4" class="calibre_16">Qualitative generalization is a term used in a limited way in qualitative research, since the intent of this form of inquiry is not to generalize findings to individuals, sites, or places outside of those under study (see Gibbs, 2007, for his cautionary note about qualitative generalizability). In fact, the value of qualitative research lies in the particular description and themes developed in the context of a specific site. Particularity rather than generalizability (Greene &amp; Caracelli, 1997) is the hallmark of good qualitative research. However, there are a few discussions in the qualitative literature about generalizability, especially as applied to case study research in which the inquirer studies several cases. Yin (2009), for example, felt that qualitative case study results can be generalized to some broader theory. The generalization occurs when qualitative researchers study additional cases and generalize findings to the new cases. It is the same as the replication logic used in experimental research. However, to repeat a case study’s findings in a new case setting requires good documentation of qualitative procedures, such as a protocol for documenting the problem in detail and the development of a thorough case study database.</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-193" class="calibre_20">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Writing the Qualitative Report</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">A plan for qualitative methods should end with some comments about the narrative that will emerge from the data analysis.

Using a qualitative strategy of inquiry, these results may also provide a chronological narrative of an individual’s life (narrative research), a detailed description of their experiences (phenomenology), a theory generated from the data (grounded theory), a detailed portrait of a culture-sharing group (ethnography), or an in-depth analysis of one or more cases (case study).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Given these different strategies, the findings and interpretation sections of a plan for a study might discuss how the sections will be presented: as objective accounts, fieldwork experiences (Van Maanen, 1988), a chronology, a process model, an extended story, an analysis by cases or across cases, or a detailed descriptive portrait.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">At the specific level, there might be some inclusion in the proposal or project about writing strategies that will be used to convey the qualitative research.

Also, we have maintained Miller’s use of the term </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">informant,</span></span><span class="calibre3"> although today, the more appropriate term </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">participant</span></span><span class="calibre3"> should be used.</span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><blockquote class="calibre_28"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Qualitative Research Paradigm</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">The qualitative research paradigm has its roots in cultural anthropology and American sociology (Kirk &amp; Miller, 1986). It has only recently been adopted by educational researchers (Borg &amp; Gall, 1989). The intent of qualitative research is to understand a particular social situation, event, role, group, or interaction (Locke, Spirduso, &amp; Silverman, 1987). It is largely an investigative process where the researcher gradually makes sense of a social phenomenon by contrasting, comparing, replicating, cataloguing and classifying the object of study (Miles &amp; Huberman, 1984). Marshall and Rossman (1989) suggest that this entails immersion in the everyday life of the setting chosen for the study; the researcher enters the informants’ world and through ongoing interaction, seeks the informants’ perspectives and meanings. </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Qualitative assumptions are mentioned.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Scholars contend that qualitative research can be distinguished from quantitative methodology by numerous unique characteristics that are inherent in the design. The following is a synthesis of commonly articulated assumptions regarding characteristics presented by various researchers.</span></blockquote><div class="calibre_26">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Qualitative research occurs in natural settings, where human behavior and events occur.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Qualitative research is based on assumptions that are very different from quantitative designs. Theory or hypotheses are not established a priori.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">The researcher is the primary instrument in data collection rather than some inanimate mechanism (Eisner, 1991; Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 1990; Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985; Merriam, 1988).</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">The data that emerge from a qualitative study are descriptive. That is, data are reported in words (primarily the participant’s words) or pictures, rather than in numbers (Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 1990; Locke et al., 1987; Marshall &amp; Rossman, 1989; Merriam, 1988).</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">The focus of qualitative research is on participants’ perceptions and experiences, and the way they make sense of their lives (Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 1990; Locke et al., 1987; Merriam, 1988). The attempt is therefore to understand not one, but multiple realities (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985).</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Qualitative research focuses on the process that is occurring as well as the product or outcome. Researchers are particularly interested in understanding how things occur (Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 1990; Merriam, 1988).</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Idiographic interpretation is utilized. In other words, attention is paid to particulars; and data is interpreted in regard to the particulars of a case rather than generalizations.</span></li><li value="8" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Qualitative research is an emergent design in its negotiated outcomes. Meanings and interpretations are negotiated with human data sources because it is the subjects’ realities that the researcher attempts to reconstruct (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985; Merriam, 1988).</span></li><a id="calibre_link-405"></a><li value="9" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">This research tradition relies on the utilization of tacit knowledge (intuitive and felt knowledge) because often the nuances of the multiple realities can be appreciated most in this way (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985). Therefore, data are not quantifiable in the traditional sense of the word.</span></li><li value="10" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Objectivity and truthfulness are critical to both research traditions. However, the criteria for judging a qualitative study differ from quantitative research. First and foremost, the researcher seeks believability, based on coherence, insight and instrumental utility (Eisner, 1991) and trustworthiness (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985) through a process of verification rather than through traditional validity and reliability measures. </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Qualitative characteristics are mentioned.]</span></span></li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><blockquote class="calibre_28"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Ethnographic Research Design</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">This study will utilize the ethnographic research tradition. This design emerged from the field of anthropology, primarily from the contributions of Bronislaw Malinowski, Robert Park and Franz Boas (Jacob, 1987; Kirk &amp; Miller, 1986). The intent of ethnographic research is to obtain a holistic picture of the subject of study with emphasis on portraying the everyday experiences of individuals by observing and interviewing them and relevant others (Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 1990). The ethnographic study includes in-depth interviewing and continual and ongoing participant observation of a situation (Jacob, 1987) and in attempting to capture the whole picture reveals how people describe and structure their world (Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 1990). </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[The author used the ethnographic approach.]</span></span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Researcher’s Role</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">Particularly in qualitative research, the role of the researcher as the primary data collection instrument necessitates the identification of personal values, assumptions and biases at the outset of the study. The investigator’s contribution to the research setting can be useful and positive rather than detrimental (Locke et al., 1987). My perceptions of higher education and the college presidency have been shaped by my personal experiences. From August 1980 to May 1990 I served as a college administrator on private campuses of 600 to 5,000 students. Most recently (1987&ndash;1990), I served as the Dean for Student Life at a small college in the Midwest. As a member of the President’s cabinet, I was involved with all top level administrative cabinet activities and decisions and worked closely with the faculty, cabinet officers, president and board of trustees. In addition to reporting to the president, I worked with him through his first year in office. I believe this understanding of the context and role enhances my awareness, knowledge and sensitivity to many of the challenges, decisions and issues encountered as a first year president and will assist me in working with the informant in this study. I bring knowledge of both the structure of higher education and of the role of the college presidency. Particular attention will be paid to the role of the new president in initiating change, relationship building, decision making, and providing leadership and vision.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Due to previous experiences working closely with a new college president, I bring certain biases to this study. Although every effort will be made to ensure objectivity, these biases may shape the way I view and understand the data I collect and the way I interpret my experiences. I commence this study with the perspective that the college presidency is a diverse and often difficult position. Though expectations are immense, I question how much power the president has to initiate change and provide leadership and vision. I view the first year as critical; filled with adjustments, frustrations, unanticipated surprises and challenges. </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Author reflected on her role in the study.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote id="calibre_link-367" class="calibre_36"><span class="calibre3">

First and foremost, the researcher has an obligation to respect the rights, needs, values, and desires of the informant(s). To an extent, ethnographic research is always obtrusive. Participant observation invades the life of the informant (Spradley, 1980) and sensitive information is frequently revealed. This is of particular concern in this study where the informant’s position and institution are highly visible. The following safeguards will be employed to protect the informant’s rights: 1) the research objectives will be articulated verbally and in writing so that they are clearly understood by the informant (including a description of how data will be used), 2) written permission to proceed with the study as articulated will be received from the informant, 3) a research exemption form will be filed with the Institutional Review Board (Appendixes B1 and B2), 4) the informant will be informed of all data collection devices and activities, 5) verbatim transcriptions and written interpretations and reports will be made available to the informant, 6) the informant’s rights, interests and wishes will be considered first when choices are made regarding reporting the data, and 7) the final decision regarding informant anonymity will rest with the informant. </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Author addressed ethical issues and IRB review.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote id="calibre_link-379" class="calibre_36"><span class="calibre3">

This will include a minimum of bi-monthly, 45 minute recorded interviews with the informant (initial interview questions, Appendix C), bimonthly two hour observations of administrative cabinet meetings, bi-monthly two hour observations of daily activities and bi-monthly analysis of the president’s calendar and documents (meeting minutes, memos, publications). In addition, the informant has agreed to record impressions of his experiences, thoughts and feelings in a taped diary (guidelines for recorded reflection, Appendix D). Two follow-up interviews will be scheduled for the end of May 1992 (See Appendix E for proposed timeline and activity schedule). </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[The author proposed to use face-to-face interviews, participate as observer, and obtain private documents.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">To assist in the data collection phase I will utilize a field log, providing a detailed account of ways I plan to spend my time when I am on-site, and in the transcription and analysis phase (also comparing this record to how time is actually spent). I intend to record details related to my observations in a field notebook and keep a field diary to chronicle my own thinking, feeling, experiences and perceptions throughout the research process. </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[The author recorded descriptive and reflective information.]</span></span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Data Analysis Procedures</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">Merriam (1988) and Marshall and Rossman (1989) contend that data collection and data analysis must be a simultaneous process in qualitative research. Schatzman and Strauss (1973) claim that qualitative data analysis primarily entails classifying things, persons, and events and the properties which characterize them. Typically throughout the data analysis process ethnographers index or code their data using as many categories as possible (Jacob, 1987). They seek to identify and describe patterns and themes from the perspective of the participant(s), then attempt to understand and explain these patterns and themes (Agar, 1980). During data analysis the data will be organized categorically and chronologically, reviewed repeatedly, and continually coded. A list of major ideas that surface will be chronicled (as suggested by Merriam, 1988). Taped interviews and the participant’s taped diary will be transcribed verbatim. Field notes and diary entries will be regularly reviewed. </span><a id="calibre_link-371"></a><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Author described steps in data analysis.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">In addition, the data analysis process will be aided by the use of a qualitative data analysis computer program called HyperQual. Raymond Padilla (Arizona State University) designed HyperQual in 1987 for use with the Macintosh computer. HyperQual utilizes HyperCard software and facilitates the recording and analysis of textual and graphic data. Special stacks are designated to hold and organize data. Using HyperQual the researcher can directly “enter field data, including interview data, observations, researcher’s memos, and illustrations . . . (and) tag (or code) all or part of the source data so that chunks of data can be pulled out and then be reassembled in a new and illuminating configuration” (Padilla, 1989, pp. 69&ndash;70). Meaningful data chunks can be identified, retrieved, isolated, grouped and regrouped for analysis. Categories or code names can be entered initially or at a later date. Codes can be added, changed or deleted with HyperQual editor and text can be searched for key categories, themes, words or phrases. </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Author mentions the proposed use of computer software for data analysis.]</span></span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Verification</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">In ensuring internal validity, the following strategies will be employed:</span></blockquote><div class="calibre_38">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Triangulation of data&mdash;Data will be collected through multiple sources to include interviews, observations and document analysis;</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Member checking&mdash;The informant will serve as a check throughout the analysis process.

Three techniques to ensure reliability will be employed in this study. First, the researcher will provide a detailed account of the focus of the study, the researcher’s role, the informant’s position and basis for selection, and the context from which data will be gathered (LeCompte &amp; Goetz, 1984). Second, triangulation or multiple methods of data collection and analysis will be used, which strengthens reliability as well as internal validity (Merriam, 1988). Finally, data collection and analysis strategies will be reported in detail in order to provide a clear and accurate picture of the methods used in this study.

Miles and Huberman (1984) address the importance of creating a data display and suggest that narrative text has been the most frequent form of display for qualitative data. This is a naturalistic study. Therefore, the results will be presented in descriptive, narrative form rather than as a scientific report. Thick description will be the vehicle for communicating a holistic picture of the experiences of a new college president. The final project will be a construction of the informant’s experiences and the meanings he attaches to them. This will allow readers to vicariously experience the challenges he encounters and provide a lens through which readers can view the subject’s world. </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">[Outcomes of the study were mentioned.]</span></span></blockquote><blockquote id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre_55"><span class="calibre3">Summary</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">This chapter explored the components that go into developing and writing a qualitative method section for a proposal. Recognizing the variation that exists in qualitative studies, the chapter advances a general guideline for procedures. This guideline includes a discussion about the general characteristics of qualitative research if audiences are not familiar with this approach to research. These characteristics are that the research takes place in the natural setting, relies on the researcher as the instrument for data collection, employs multiple methods of data collection, is both inductive and deductive, is based on participants’ meanings, includes researcher reflexivity, and is holistic. The guideline recommends discussing a research design, such as the study of individuals (narrative, phenomenology); the exploration of processes, activities, and events (case study, grounded theory); or the examination of broad culture-sharing behavior of individuals or groups (ethnography). The choice of design needs to be presented and defended. Further, the proposal or study needs to address the role of the researcher: past experiences, history, culture, and how this potentially shapes interpretations of the data. It also includes a discussion about personal connections to the site, steps to gain entry, and anticipation of sensitive ethical issues. Discussion of data collection should advance the purposeful sampling approach and the forms of data to be collected (i.e., observations, interviews, documents, and audiovisual and digital materials). It is useful to also indicate the types of data recording protocols that will be used.</span><a id="calibre_link-316"></a></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">Data analysis is an ongoing process during research. It involves analyzing participant information, and researchers typically employ general analysis steps as well as those steps found within a specific design. More general steps include organizing and preparing the data; an initial reading through the information; coding the data; developing from the codes a description and thematic analysis; using computer programs; representing the findings in tables, graphs, and figures; and interpreting the findings. These interpretations involve stating lessons learned, comparing the findings with past literature and theory, raising questions, offering personal perspective, stating limitations, and advancing an agenda for reform. The project should also contain a section on the expected outcomes for the study. Finally, an additional important step in planning a proposal is to mention the strategies that will be used to validate the accuracy of the findings and demonstrate the reliability of codes and themes.</span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><blockquote id="calibre_link-196" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Writing Exercises</span></span></blockquote><div class="calibre_38">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre_15"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Write a plan for the procedure to be used in your qualitative study.

Up until this point, we have considered collected quantitative data and qualitative data. We have not discussed “mixing” or combining the two forms of data in a study. We can start with the assumption that both forms of data provide different types of information (open-ended data in the case of qualitative and closed-ended data in the case of quantitative). If we further assume that each type of data collection has both limitations and strengths, we can consider how the strengths can be combined to develop a stronger understanding of the research problem or questions (and, as well, overcome the limitations of each). In a sense, more <span class="italic">insight</span> into a problem is to be gained from mixing or integration of the quantitative and qualitative data. This “mixing” or integrating of data, it can be argued, provides a stronger understanding of the problem or question than either by itself. Mixed methods research, therefore, is simply “mining” the databases more by integrating them. This idea is at the core of a new methodology called “mixed methods research.”</p><p class="calibre_">Conveying the nature of mixed methods research and its essential characteristics needs to begin a good mixed methods procedure. Start with the assumption that mixed methods is a methodology in research and that the readers need to be educated as to the basic intent and definition of the design, the reasons for choosing the procedure, and the value it will lend to a study. Then, decide on a mixed methods design to use. There are several from which to choose; consider the different possibilities and decide which one is best for your proposed study. With this choice in hand, discuss the data collection, the data analysis, and the data interpretation, discussion, and validation procedures within the context of the design. Finally, end with a discussion of potential ethical issues that need to be anticipated in the study, and suggest an outline for writing the final study. These are all standard methods procedures, and they are framed in this chapter as they apply to mixed methods research. <a href="#calibre_link-241">Table 10.1</a> shows a checklist of the mixed methods procedures addressed in this chapter.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-198" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Components of Mixed Methods Procedures</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">Mixed methods research has evolved into a set of procedures that proposal developers and study designers can use in planning a mixed methods study.

Now several journals emphasize mixed methods research, such as the <span class="italic">Journal of Mixed Methods Research, Quality and Quantity, Field Methods</span>, and the <span class="italic">International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches.</span> Additional journals actively encourage this form of inquiry (e.g., <span class="italic">International Journal of Social Research Methodology, Qualitative Health Research, Annals of Family Medicine</span>). Numerous published research studies have incorporated mixed methods research in the social and human sciences in diverse fields such as occupational therapy (Lysack &amp; Krefting, 1994), interpersonal communication (Boneva, Kraut, &amp; Frohlich, 2001), AIDS prevention (Janz et al., 1996), dementia caregiving (Weitzman &amp; Levkoff, 2000), occupational health (Ames, Duke, Moore, &amp; Cunradi, 2009), mental health (Rogers, Day, Randall, &amp; Bentall, 2003), and in middle school science (Houtz, 1995). New books arrive each year solely devoted to mixed methods research (Bryman, 2006; Creswell, 2015; Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2018; Greene, 2007; Morse &amp; Niehaus, 2009; Plano Clark &amp; Creswell, 2008; Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 1998, 2010; Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori, 2009).</p><blockquote id="calibre_link-241" class="calibre_28">

It has gone through several periods of development and growth, and it continues to evolve, especially in procedures. Several texts outline these developmental phases (e.g., Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011, 2018; Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori, 2009). This section could also include a brief discussion about the importance or rise of mixed methods today through indicators such as federal funding initiatives, dissertations, and the discipline-specific discussions about mixed methods found in journals across the social and health sciences (see Creswell, 2010, 2011, 2015).</li><a id="calibre_link-318"></a><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Reasons for choosing mixed methods research.</span> Follow this section with statements about the value and rationale for the choice of mixed methods as an approach for your project.

</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Types of Mixed Methods Designs</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">There have been several typologies for classifying and identifying types of mixed methods strategies that proposal developers might use in their proposed mixed methods study. Creswell and Plano Clark (2018) identified several classification systems drawn from the fields of evaluation, nursing, public health, education policy and research, and social and behavioral research. In these classifications, authors used diverse terms for their types of designs, and a substantial amount of overlap of types existed in the typologies. For purposes of clarifying the design discussion in the mixed methods field, we will identify <span class="italic">three core mixed methods designs</span> (as shown in <a href="#calibre_link-242">Figures 10.1</a> and <a href="#calibre_link-243">10.2</a>)&mdash;the convergent design, the explanatory sequential design, and the exploratory sequential design&mdash;and then briefly mention more complex designs (i.e., the mixed methods experimental design, the mixed methods case study design, the mixed methods participatory&ndash;social justice design, and the mixed methods evaluation design) in which the core designs can be embedded. Each approach will be discussed in terms of a description of the design, the forms of data collection and data analysis and integration, interpretation, and validity challenges.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Convergent Mixed Methods Design</span></span></p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Description of the design</span>. The convergent mixed methods design is probably the most familiar of the core and complex mixed methods approaches. Researchers new to mixed methods typically first think of this approach because they feel that mixed methods only consists of combining the quantitative and qualitative data. In this single-phase approach, a researcher collects both quantitative and qualitative data, analyzes them separately, and then compares the results to see if the findings confirm or disconfirm each other (see <a href="#calibre_link-242">Figure 10.1</a>). The key assumption of this approach is that both qualitative and quantitative data provide different types of information&mdash;often detailed views of participants qualitatively and scores on instruments quantitatively&mdash;and together they yield results that should be the same. It builds off the historic concept of the multimethod, multitrait idea from Campbell and Fiske (1959), who felt that a psychological trait could best be understood by gathering different forms of data. Although the Campbell and Fiske conceptualization included only quantitative data, the mixed methods researchers extended the idea to include the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data. <p class="calibre_1"></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 10.1</span> Three Core Mixed Methods Designs</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000039.jpg" id="calibre_link-242" class="calibre_71" /></p></li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Data collection.</span> The qualitative data can assume any of the forms discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-16">Chapter 9</a>, such as interviews, observations, documents, and records. The quantitative data can be instrument data, observational checklists, or numeric records, such as census data, as discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-15">Chapter 8</a>. Ideally, the key idea with this design is to collect both forms of data using the <span class="italic">same or parallel variables, constructs, or concepts</span>. In other words, if the concept of self-esteem is being measured during quantitative data collection, the same concept is asked during the qualitative data collection process, such as in an open-ended interview. Some researchers will use this design to associate certain themes with statistical data using different forms of data for the quantitative and qualitative data collection. For instance, Shaw et al. (2013) compared quality improvement practices in family medicine clinics with colorectal cancer screening rates. Another data collection issue is the sample size for both the qualitative and quantitative data collection process. Unquestionably, the data for the qualitative data collection will be smaller than that for the quantitative data collection. This is because the intent of data collection for qualitative data is to locate and obtain information from a small sample but to gather extensive information from this sample; whereas, in quantitative research, a large <span class="italic">N</span> is needed in order to infer meaningful statistical results from samples to a population. <p class="calibre_">How is this inequality resolved in a convergent mixed methods design? Sometimes mixed methods researchers will collect information from the same number of individuals on both the qualitative and quantitative databases. This means that the qualitative sample will be increased, and it will limit the amount of data collected from any one individual. Another approach would be to weight the qualitative cases so that they equal the <span class="italic">N</span> in the quantitative database. One other approach taken by some mixed methods researchers is not to consider the unequal sample sizes a problem. They would argue that the intent of qualitative and quantitative research differs (one to gain an in-depth perspective and the other, to generalize to a population) and that each provides an adequate count. Another issue in sampling is whether the individuals for the sample of qualitative participants should also be individuals in the quantitative sample. Typically, mixed methods researchers would include the sample of qualitative participants in the larger quantitative sample, because ultimately researchers make a comparison between the two databases and the more they are similar, the better the comparison.</p></li><a id="calibre_link-356"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Data analysis and integration</span>. Data analysis in a convergent design consists of three phases. First, analyze the qualitative database by coding the data and collapsing the codes into broad themes. Second, analyze the quantitative database in terms of statistical results. Third comes the mixed methods data analysis. This is the analysis that consists of integrating the two databases. <p class="calibre_">This integration consists of merging the results from both the qualitative and the quantitative findings. One challenge in this design is how to actually merge the two databases since bringing together a numeric quantitative database with a text qualitative database is not intuitive. There are several ways to merge the two databases:</p><ul class="calibre_54"><li value="1" class="calibre_16">The first approach is called a side-by-side comparison. These comparisons can be seen in the discussion sections of mixed methods studies. The researcher will first report the quantitative statistical results and then discuss the qualitative findings (e.g., themes) that either confirm or disconfirm the statistical results. Alternatively, the researcher might start with the qualitative findings and then compare them to the quantitative results. Mixed methods writers call this a side-by-side approach because the researcher makes the comparison within a discussion, presenting first one set of findings and then the other. A good example of this can be seen in the Classen and colleagues’ (2007) study.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16">Researchers can also merge the two databases by changing or transforming qualitative codes or themes into quantitative variables and then combining the two quantitative databases&mdash;a procedure in mixed methods research called data transformation. The researcher takes the qualitative themes or codes and counts them (and possibly groups them) to form quantitative measures. Some useful procedures that mixed methods researchers have used can be found in Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2006). This approach is popular among researchers trained in quantitative research who may not value or see the worth of an independent qualitative interpretive database.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16">A final procedure involves merging the two forms of data in a table or a graph. This is called a <span class="bold">joint display</span> of data, and it can take many different forms. It might be a table that arrays the themes on the horizontal axis and a categorical variable (e.g., different types of providers such as nurses, physician assistants, and doctors) on the vertical axis. It might be a table with key questions or concepts on the vertical axis and then two columns on the horizontal axis indicating qualitative responses and quantitative responses to the key questions or concepts (Li, Marquart, &amp; Zercher, 2000). The basic idea is for the researcher to jointly display both forms of data&mdash;effectively merging them&mdash;in a single visual and then make an interpretation of the display (see Guetterman, Fetters, &amp; Creswell, 2015).</li></ul></li><a id="calibre_link-260"></a><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Interpretation.</span> The interpretation in the convergent approach is typically written into a discussion section of the study. Whereas the results section reports on the findings from the analysis of both the quantitative and qualitative databases, the discussion section includes a discussion comparing the results from the two databases and notes whether there is convergence or divergence between the two sources of information. Typically the comparison does not yield a clean convergent or divergent situation, and differences exist on a few concepts, themes, or scales. When divergence occurs, steps for follow-up need to be taken. The researcher can state divergence as a limitation in the study without further follow-up. This approach represents a weak solution. Alternatively, mixed methods researchers can return to the analyses and further explore the databases, collect additional information to resolve the differences, or discuss the results from one of the databases as possibly limited (e.g., the constructs were not valid quantitatively or the qualitative themes did not match the open-ended questions). Whatever approach the researcher takes, the key point in a convergent design is to further discuss and probe results when divergent findings exist.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Validity.</span> Validity using the convergent approach should be based on establishing both quantitative validity (e.g., construct) and qualitative validity (e.g., triangulation) for each database. Is there a special form of mixed methods validity that needs to be addressed? There are certainly some potential threats to validity in using the convergent approach, and several of these have already been mentioned. Unequal sample sizes may provide less of a picture on the qualitative side than the larger <span class="italic">N</span> on the quantitative side. Generally we find the use of unequal sample sizes in a convergent design study, with the researcher acknowledging the different perspectives on size taken by quantitative and qualitative researchers. The use of different concepts or variables on both sides, quantitative and qualitative, may yield incomparable and difficult-to-merge findings. Our recommended approach is to use the same concepts for both the quantitative and qualitative arms of the research study, but we acknowledge that some researchers use the convergent design to associate different qualitative and quantitative concepts. A lack of follow-up on conclusions when the scores and themes diverge also represents an invalid strategy of inquiry. In this discussion we have recommended several ways to probe divergence in more detail and would recommend the use of one or more of these strategies in a convergent design project.</li><a id="calibre_link-376"></a></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-202" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design</span></span></p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Description of the design.</span> The explanatory sequential mixed methods approach is a design in mixed methods that appeals to individuals with a strong quantitative background or from fields relatively new to qualitative approaches. It involves a two-phase data collection project in which the researcher collects quantitative data in the first phase, analyzes the results, and then uses the results to plan (or build on to) the second, qualitative phase. The quantitative results typically inform the types of participants to be purposefully selected for the qualitative phase and the types of questions that will be asked of the participants. The overall intent of this design is to have the qualitative data help explain in more detail the initial quantitative results, thus it is important to tie together or to connect the quantitative results to the qualitative data collection. A typical procedure might involve collecting survey data in the first phase, analyzing the data, and then following up with qualitative interviews to help explain confusing, contradictory, or unusual survey responses.</li><a id="calibre_link-380"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Data collection.</span> The data collection proceeds in two distinct phases with rigorous quantitative sampling in the first phase and with purposeful sampling in the second, qualitative phase. One challenge in this strategy is to plan adequately what quantitative results to follow up on and what participants to gather qualitative data from in the second phase. The key idea is that the qualitative data collection builds directly on the quantitative results. The quantitative results that then are built on may be extreme or outlier cases, significant predictors, significant results relating variables, insignificant results, or even demographics. For example, when using demographics, the researcher could find in the initial quantitative phase that individuals in different socioeconomic levels respond differently to the dependent variables. Thus, the follow-up qualitatively may group respondents to the quantitative phase into different categories and conduct qualitative data collection with individuals representing each of the categories. Another challenge is whether the qualitative sample should be individuals that are in the initial quantitative sample. The answer to this question should be that they are the same individuals, because the intent of the design is to follow up the quantitative results and explore the results in more depth. The idea of explaining the mechanism&mdash;how the variables interact&mdash;in more depth through the qualitative follow-up is a key strength of this design.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Data analysis and integration.</span> The quantitative and the qualitative databases are analyzed separately in this approach. Then the researcher combines the two databases by the form of integration called connecting the quantitative results to the qualitative data collection. This is the point of integration in an explanatory sequential design. Thus, the quantitative results are then used to <span class="italic">plan</span> the qualitative follow-up. One important area is that the quantitative results cannot only inform the sampling procedure but it can also point toward the types of qualitative questions to ask participants in the second phase. These questions, like all good qualitative research questions, are general and open-ended. Because analysis proceeds independently for each phase, this design is useful for student research and perhaps easier to accomplish (than the convergent design) because one database explains the other and the data collection can be spaced out over time.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Interpretation.</span> The mixed methods researcher interprets the follow up results in a discussion section of the study. This interpretation follows the form of first reporting the quantitative, first-phase results and then the qualitative, second phase results. However, this design then employs a third form of interpretation: how the qualitative findings help to explain the quantitative results. A common misstep at this point by beginning researchers is to merge the two databases. While this approach may be helpful, the intent of the design is to have the qualitative data help to provide more depth, more insight into the quantitative results. Accordingly, in the interpretation section, after the researcher presents the general quantitative and then qualitative results, a discussion should follow that specifies how the qualitative results help to expand or explain the quantitative results. Because the qualitative database questions narrows the scope of the quantitative questions, a direct comparison of the overall results of the two databases is not recommended.</li><a id="calibre_link-381"></a><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Validity.</span> As with all mixed methods studies, the researcher needs to establish the validity of the scores from the quantitative measures and to discuss the validity of the qualitative findings. In the explanatory sequential mixed methods approach, additional validity concerns arise. The accuracy of the overall findings may be compromised because the researcher does not consider and weigh all of the options for following up on the quantitative results. We recommend that researchers consider all options for identifying results to follow up on before settling on one approach. Attention may focus only on personal demographics and overlook important explanations that need further understanding. The researcher may also contribute to invalidated results by drawing on different samples for each phase of the study. If explaining the quantitative results in more depth, then it makes sense to select the qualitative sample from individuals who participated in the quantitative sample. This maximizes the importance of one phase explaining the other. These are a few of the challenges that need to be built into the planning process for a good explanatory sequential mixed methods study.</li></ul><p id="calibre_link-203" class="calibre_20">
</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods Design</span></span></p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Description of the design.</span> If we reverse the explanatory sequential approach and start with a qualitative phase first followed by a quantitative phase, we have an exploratory sequential approach. A three-phase exploratory sequential mixed methods is a design in which the researcher first begins by exploring with qualitative data and analysis, then builds a feature to be tested (e.g., a new survey instrument, experimental procedures, a website, or new variables) and tests this feature in a quantitative third phase. Like the explanatory sequential approach, the second feature builds on the results of the initial database. The intent of this design is to explore with a sample first so that a later quantitative phase can be tailored to meet the needs of the individuals being studied. Sometimes this quantitative feature will include developing a contextually sensitive measurement instrument and then testing it with a sample. Other times it may involve developing new variables not available in the literature or attuned to a specific population being studied, or designing a website or an Internet application shaped to the needs of the individuals being studied. This design is popular in global health research when, for example, investigators need to understand a community or population before administering English-language instruments. <p class="calibre_">In this design, the researcher would first collect focus group data, analyze the results, develop an instrument (or other quantitative feature such as a website for testing), and then administer it to a sample of a population. In this case, there may not be adequate instruments to measure the concepts with the sample the investigator wishes to study. In effect, the researcher employs a three-phase procedure with the first phase as exploratory, the second as instrument (or quantitative feature) development, and the third as administering and testing the instrument feature to a sample of a population.</p></li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Data collection.</span> In this strategy, the data collection would occur at two points in the design: the initial qualitative data collection and the test of the quantitative feature in the third phase of the project. The challenge is how to use the information from the initial qualitative phase to build or identify the quantitative feature in the second phase. This is the integration point in an exploratory sequential design. <p class="calibre_">Several options exist, and we will use the approach of developing a culturally sensitive instrument as an illustration. The qualitative data analysis can be used to develop an instrument with good psychometric properties (i.e., validity, reliability). The qualitative data analysis will yield quotes, codes, and themes (see <a href="#calibre_link-16">Chapter 9</a>). The development of an instrument can proceed by using the quotes to write items for an instrument, the codes to develop variables that group the items, and themes that group the codes into scales. This is a useful procedure for moving from qualitative data analysis to scale development (the quantitative feature developed in the second phase). Scale development also needs to follow good procedures for instrument design, and the steps for this include ideas such as item discrimination, construct validity, and reliability estimates (see DeVellis, 2012).</p><p class="calibre_">Developing a good psychometric instrument that fits the sample and population under study is not the only use of this design. A researcher can analyze the qualitative data to develop new variables that may not be present in the literature, to identify the types of scales that might exist in current instruments or to form categories of information that will be explored further in a quantitative phase. The question arises if the sample for the qualitative phase is the same for the quantitative phase. This cannot be, because the qualitative sample is typically much smaller than a quantitative sample needed to generalize from a sample to a population. Sometimes mixed methods researchers will use entirely different samples for the qualitative (first phase) and quantitative components (third phase) of the study. However, a good procedure is to draw both samples from the same population but make sure that the individuals for both samples are not the same. To have individuals help develop an instrument and then to survey them in the quantitative phase would introduce confounding factors into the study.</p></li><a id="calibre_link-323"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Data analysis and integration.</span> In this strategy the researcher analyzes the two databases separately and uses the findings from the initial exploratory database to build into a feature that can be analyzed quantitatively. So integration in this design involves using the qualitative findings (or results) to inform the design of a quantitative phase of the research such as the development of a measurement instrument or new variables. This means that the researcher needs to pay careful attention to the qualitative data analysis steps and determine what findings to build on. If, for example, the researcher uses grounded theory (see <a href="#calibre_link-16">Chapter 9</a>), the theoretical model generated may provide a model to be tested in the second, quantitative phase. A qualitative case study can yield different cases that become the focus of important variables in the second quantitative phase.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Interpretation.</span> Researchers interpret the mixed methods results in a discussion section of a study. The order of interpretation is to first report the qualitative findings, the development or design of the feature to be tested (e.g., the development of an instrument, the development of new quantitative measures), and then the quantitative test in the final phase of the study. It does not make sense to compare the two databases, because they are typically drawn from different samples (as noted above in the data collection discussion) and the intent of the strategy is to determine if the qualitative themes in the first phase can be generalized to a larger sample.</li><a id="calibre_link-372"></a><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Validity.</span> Researchers using this strategy need to check for the validity of the qualitative data as well as the validity of the quantitative scores. Special validity concerns arise, however, in using this design that need to be anticipated by the proposal or mixed methods report developer. One concern is that the researcher may not use appropriate steps to develop a good psychometric instrument. Developing a good instrument is not easy, and adequate steps need to be put in place. Another concern is that a researcher may develop an instrument or measures that do not take advantage of the richness of the qualitative findings. This occurs when the qualitative data lacks rigor or occurs simply at the theme level without the further data analysis steps associated with using one of the qualitative design-types, such as ethnography, grounded theory, or case study procedures. Finally, as previously mentioned, the sample in the qualitative phase should not be included in the quantitative phase as this will introduce undue duplication of responses. It is best to have the sample of qualitative participants provide information for scale, instrument, or variable (or website) design, but the same individuals should not complete the follow-up instruments. This sample strategy, therefore, differs from the sampling strategy needed for an explanatory sequential design.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-204" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Several Complex Mixed Methods Designs</span></span></p><p class="calibre_">After working with these three core designs&mdash;convergent, explanatory sequential, and exploratory sequential&mdash;that are the foundation of good mixed methods research, we have now branched out to incorporate more designs that typically fit complex projects. By complex we mean that the designs involve more steps and procedures than are embodied in the three core designs. These mixed methods designs are not more “advanced.” They simply involve more steps and incorporate the core designs into “processes” of research. We have come to this position based on key readings in the mixed methods literature that have surfaced in the past few years. The first step involved isolating and thinking about the types of more complex features that the core designs could be embedded within.</p><p id="calibre_link-338" class="calibre_">A useful typology emerged in the work of Plano Clark and Ivankova (2016). Their book was helpful in conceptualizing the many types of applications of complex designs. In an entire chapter they discussed the intersection of mixed methods with other approaches to form “advanced applications” (p. 136). They recommended a framework for considering the possibilities of these complex applications:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Intersecting a secondary method (mixed methods) within a primary quantitative or qualitative research design.</span> A <span class="italic">research design</span> is a set of formal procedures for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data such as those found in a quantitative experiment or qualitative case study. In this framework, a mixed methods core design could be embedded as a secondary (or supportive) method within a primary quantitative or qualitative design.

In our discussion of mixed methods, we simply need to account for these complex applications and assess how core designs might be embedded within them.</p><p class="calibre_">Another step forward in designs appeared in Nastasi and Hitchcock (2016). Their book brought forth several ideas that we now incorporate into our complex designs. They suggested that distinct “processes” occur in research in which both quantitative and qualitative data might be used in <a id="calibre_link-319"></a>distinct steps in the overall process. Their book focused on two ideas: the use of mixed methods in program evaluation and its use in experimental, intervention trials. It also relied heavily on the authors’ mixed methods study in Sri Lanka that addressed the mental health of youth, and they advanced the steps in their evaluation process and embedded into these steps the use of qualitative and quantitative data in multiple core designs. From their work we then have some practical examples of incorporating core designs into the complex procedures of an evaluation and an experimental, intervention trial.</p><p class="calibre_">Specifically, we see embedding the core designs into larger processes. As in Creswell and Plano Clark (2018), here we briefly discuss four examples of complex designs and then discuss a general model for embedding the core designs in these processes:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Mixed methods experimental (intervention) design.</span> The <span class="bold">mixed methods experimental (or intervention) design</span> involves the researcher collecting and analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data and integrating the information within an experiment or intervention trial (see <a href="#calibre_link-243">Figure 10.2</a>). This design adds qualitative data collection into an experiment or intervention so that the personal experiences of participants can be included in the research. Thus the qualitative data become a secondary source of data embedded in the experimental pre- and posttest data collection. It requires the researcher to understand experiments and to be able to design them in a rigorous way (e.g., a randomized controlled trial). As shown in <a href="#calibre_link-243">Figure 10.2</a>, researchers add the qualitative data to the experiment in different ways: before the experiment begins, during the experiment, or after the experiment (Sandelowsi, 1996). The basic ideas are to embed the core exploratory sequential design into the experiment to carry out exploration before conducting the experiment; to embed a convergent core design during the experiment to assess participants’ experiences with the intervention; or to add an explanatory sequential design into the experiment after the study to follow up on the experimental outcomes. The points at which the qualitative data collection and findings connect to the experiment represent the integration in the mixed methods study. In this design it is important to be explicit about the reasons for adding the qualitative data. We enumerated several important reasons in <a href="#calibre_link-243">Figure 10.2</a>. These lists are representative of the examples of mixed methods research we have found in the literature. The qualitative data collection can occur at a single point in time or at multiple points in time depending on the resources available to the researcher. This type of mixed methods use has become popular in the health sciences. <p class="calibre_1"></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 10.2</span> Mixed Methods Intervention Design</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000027.jpg" class="calibre_72" /></p><blockquote class="calibre_32">Source: Adapted from Sandelowski (1996).</blockquote></li><a id="calibre_link-243"></a><li value="2" class="calibre_33"><span class="italic">Case study design.</span> The <span class="bold">mixed methods case study design</span> involves the use of one or more core designs (i.e., convergent, explanatory sequential, exploratory sequential) within the framework of a single or multiple case study design. The intent of this design is to develop or generate cases based on both quantitative and qualitative results and their integration. We have found two basic variants of this design. One is a deductive approach where researchers establish the cases at the outset of the study and document the differences in the cases through the qualitative and quantitative data. A second is more of an inductive approach where the researcher collects and analyzes both quantitative and qualitative data and then forms cases&mdash;often multiple cases&mdash;and then makes comparisons among the cases. Regardless of the approach, the challenge is to identify the cases before the study begins or to generate cases based on the evidence collected. Another challenge is to understand case study research (Stake, 1995; Yin, 2014) and effectively intersect case study design with mixed methods. The type of core design embedded within this approach can vary, but we can find good illustrations of the design using a convergent design (Shaw, Ohman-Strickland, &amp; Piasecki, 2013). Within this framework, the typical mixed methods case study design is one where both types of data are gathered concurrently in a convergent core design and the results are merged together to examine a case and/or compare multiple cases. This type of mixed methods case study design is shown in <a href="#calibre_link-244">Figure 10.3</a>. In this hypothetical example, the researcher gathers both survey quantitative data and qualitative interview data at roughly the same time. Analysis of both databases produces results that can be merged to identify specific cases. These cases portray different profiles found in the databases, and they can be compared in a cross-case comparison.</li><a id="calibre_link-343"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Participatory-social justice design.</span> The <span class="bold">mixed methods participatory-social justice design</span> is a mixed methods design in which the researcher adds a core design within a larger participatory and/or social justice theoretical or conceptual framework (see <a href="#calibre_link-244">Figure 10.4</a>). The intent of this design is to give voice to participants and collaborate with them in shaping the research and to build evidence from both quantitative and qualitative data. As a complex design, these frameworks span the entire mixed methods study. The framework can be, for example, a feminist theory or a racial theory. It might also be a participatory theory of the involvement of stakeholders in many aspects of the mixed methods study (Ivankova, 2015), although it could be debated as to whether participatory action research exists in a study as a conceptual framework or as methodological procedures. This aside, in addition to seeing the strong placement of this theory in the study, we can also identify one or more of the core designs operating. Within a feminist mixed methods study, for example, we can see both the flow of the theory into many aspects of the project (e.g., informing the problem, shaping the research questions, highlighting the outcomes) as well as an embedded core design such as an explanatory sequential design where an initial survey is followed by one-on-one interviews. In <a href="#calibre_link-244">Figure 10.4</a>, we see this type of core design embedded within a participatory-social justice framework. This is a study discussing the transition of homeless individuals from a hospital to a shelter (Greysen, 2012). The element that makes this study participatory research is the substantial involvement of community personnel in many aspects of the study. What makes the project mixed methods is the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. As shown in <a href="#calibre_link-244">Figure 10.4</a>, we see that multiple core designs were embedded within the study. An exploratory sequential core design connected identifying the research priorities and developing a survey. Then, the data collection and analysis portrayed a convergent design with the combination of themes and statistical results. <p class="calibre_1"></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 10.3</span> Mixed Methods Case Study Design</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000029.jpg" class="calibre_73" /></p><p class="calibre_1"></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Figure 10.4</span> Mixed Methods Participatory-Social Justice Design</p><p class="calibre_1"><img src="images/000040.jpg" class="calibre_58" /></p><blockquote class="calibre_32">Source: Adapted from Greysen et al.

The intent of this design is to engage in a process of research in which both quantitative and qualitative data and their integration shapes one or more of the steps in the process. This complex design illustrates a core design within another methodology. This approach is typically used in program evaluation where quantitative and qualitative approaches are used over time to support the development, adaptation, and evaluation of programs, experiments, or policies. We often find multiple core designs occurring throughout these projects. For example, researchers might start by conducting a qualitative needs assessment study to understand the meaning of smoking and health from the perspective of adolescents in this community. Using these results, the researchers might develop an instrument and quantitatively assess the prevalence of different attitudes across the community. In a third phase, the researchers might develop a program based on what they have learned and then examine both the process and the outcomes of this intervention program. Across these phases the researchers would make use of exploratory (phase 1 to phase 2), explanatory (phase 2 to phase 3), and convergent (phase 3) core designs. <p class="calibre_">Examine <a href="#calibre_link-245">Figure 10.5</a>. This mixed methods evaluation design was used in a study of the mental health of youth in Sri Lanka (Nastasi &amp; Hitchcock, 2016). In the outer circle we see the general steps in the evaluation process. Within boxes in the circle we also find the combination of quantitative and qualitative research. In short, looking across these boxes within the circle, we see that the authors have incorporated multiple core designs at different stages in the evaluation process.

We will begin with the procedural reasons for choosing a particular mixed methods strategy. It should be recognized that many variations exist in mixed methods designs, and the particular approach an investigator has in mind may not conform exactly to the approaches specified here. However, these designs represent the common underlying features of many designs, and, with modification, researchers can find their own strategy. To choose a design for your project, consider the following factors:</p><div class="calibre_14">&nbsp;</div><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Choice based on outcomes expected or intent.</span> Earlier in this chapter, we reviewed the reasons for choosing mixed methods research. In <a href="#calibre_link-247">Table 10.3</a>, we repeat the reasons but this time link them to expected outcomes of a mixed methods project and the type of mixed methods strategy. This thinking calls for the researcher to determine the outcome anticipated at the end of the mixed methods study and then to link it to the types. These outcomes are, in turn, shaped by the intention behind including and integrating both quantitative and qualitative data.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Choice based on integrating the data together.</span> To choose a mixed methods strategy beyond considering the outcome anticipated, the researcher needs to consider whether mixed methods integration of the two databases will be <span class="italic">merged</span> (convergent mixed methods design), <span class="italic">explaining</span> (explanatory sequential design), <span class="italic">building</span> (exploratory sequential design), or <span class="italic">embedded</span> (the complex designs). Merging the data involves combining the quantitative and qualitative data through the procedures of a side-by-side comparison, data transformation, or a joint display. Connecting the data means that the analysis of one data set is used to lead into or build into the second data set. In short, the data analysis of one data set informs the data collection of the other data set. In embedding, one data set&mdash;involving quantitative, qualitative, or combined data&mdash;is embedded within a larger design, theory, or methodology. <blockquote class="calibre_28">
<img src="images/000032.jpg" class="calibre_76" />
</blockquote><p class="calibre_">For example, in a convergent design the two are considered to be independent and the data collection and analysis for each database proceed separately. In an embedded experimental design, the qualitative data may be collected independently of the experiment and used to support or augment the larger design, the experiment. Alternatively, the two databases may be connected, with one building on the other. This is a sequential type of design (explanatory sequential design or an exploratory sequential design), and one database does not stand in isolation of the other database. In these sequential designs, the data collection in the second phase cannot be conducted until the first phase results are in. In short, the follow-up data collection builds directly on the results of the initial data collection.</p></li><a id="calibre_link-247"></a><li value="3" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Choice based on the timing of the data collection.</span> A related factor is <span class="bold">timing in mixed methods data collection</span>&mdash;whether the two databases are collected concurrently, at roughly the same time, or with one following the other, sequentially. A convergent strategy typically involves collecting data concurrently while the explanatory sequential and the exploratory sequential strategies means that the data will be collected in sequence. Sometimes this criterion is difficult to identify in published mixed methods studies, but it should go into the thinking about choosing a mixed methods strategy. In complex designs, the timing may vary and be included at multiple time points in the design.</li><a id="calibre_link-383"></a><li value="4" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Choice based on the emphasis placed on each database.</span> Like timing, the <span class="bold">emphasis placed on each database</span> in mixed methods research is also somewhat difficult to determine and to apply to the question of choice. A mixed methods study can illustrate an equal emphasis (or priority or weight) on both databases, or an unequal emphasis. For example, a mixed methods project can stress the qualitative phase of the research and give minimal attention to the quantitative phase. How can we tell? We can look at the number of pages in a study to determine emphasis, how the study begins (e.g., with a strong quantitative theory orientation or personal qualitative stories), the amount of depth and sophistication given to the qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, or even the background training of the investigator. As mentioned earlier in the section on notation, capital letters may be used in the notation for greater emphasis (e.g., QUAN) and lowercase letters for less emphasis (e.g., quan). The emphasis can help determine the choice of a mixed methods strategy. Typically if the researcher seeks to emphasize both databases, a convergent approach is best. Alternatively, if a stronger emphasis is sought for the quantitative approach, then an explanatory sequential strategy is used because it began with the quantitative component of the study. If a qualitative approach is to be emphasized, then an exploratory sequential strategy is chosen. These are not firm guidelines, but they may play into the overall decision about a choice of strategy.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Choice based on type of design most suited for a field.</span> On a practical level, the choice of a strategy depends on the inclination of fields toward certain mixed methods designs. For quantitatively oriented fields, the explanatory sequential approach seems to work well because the study begins (and perhaps is driven) by the quantitative phase of the research. In qualitatively oriented fields, the exploratory sequential approach may be more appealing because it begins with an exploration using qualitative research. However, in this approach, an outcome may be a measurement instrument that is tested so that the outcome, a quantitative outcome, outweighs in importance how the study began. In some fields, the choice of approach may be dependent on collecting data efficiently, and this would argue for a convergent mixed methods study in which both quantitative and qualitative data are typically collected at roughly the same time rather than at different times that require more visits to the research site.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_16"><span class="italic">Choice based on a single researcher or team.</span> A final practical reason for a choice of a strategy depends on whether a single researcher (e.g., graduate student) conducts the study or a team of researchers (e.g., funded long-term investigation). If the investigator is a single researcher, the sequential strategies of an explanatory sequential or exploratory sequential approach are best because the investigation can be divided into two manageable tasks rather than multiple data collection and analysis procedures. The study can be projected out over a period of time rather than collecting multiple forms of data at the same time as in a convergent approach. When time is a problem, we encourage students to think about a convergent design. In this design, both forms of data are gathered at roughly the same time, and it does not require repeated visits to the field to gather data. Complex designs are well-suited for a team of researchers who assist in the multiple phases of the research and for well-funded projects that unfold over several years.</li><a id="calibre_link-377"></a></ul><p class="calibre_">We recommend that students find a published mixed methods journal article that uses their design and introduce it to advisers and faculty committees so that they have a working model to understand the design. Since we are at the early stage of adopting mixed methods research in many fields, a published example of research in a field will help to create both legitimacy for mixed methods research and the idea that it is a feasible approach to research for graduate committees or other audiences. If a research team is conducting the study, multiple forms of data collection at the same time or over a long period of time are possible, such as in an embedded or a multiphase design. Although a single researcher can conduct a participatory&ndash;social justice study, the labor-intensive nature of collecting data in the field involving participants as collaborators typically suggests more of a team approach than the inquiry by a single investigator.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><p id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre_"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold">Examples of Mixed Methods Procedures</span></span></p><p class="calibre_"><a href="#calibre_link-208">Examples 10.1</a>&ndash;<a href="#calibre_link-211">10.4</a> illustrate mixed methods studies that use both the sequential and convergent strategies and procedures.</p><blockquote id="calibre_link-208" class="calibre_44"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre_37">

They first began with an exploratory, qualitative first phase of interviews with children and their caregivers. From a qualitative thematic analysis of the data, they then performed an extensive review of the literature to locate standardized measures that matched their qualitative findings. They found some measures and added some new ones to develop a survey instrument. This instrument went through several refinements following rigorous procedures of instrument-scale development (e.g., backward and forward translations, a discussion of items, reliability and validity) to develop good construct validity for the measures. These measures (e.g., family communication, good parenting, and others) then became the pretest and posttest assessments in an experimental (intervention) study. For the intervention in the study, the researchers were led to a strengths-based, family-based prevention program that was hypothesized to be related to the measures. The final step in the mixed methods process was to use the validated measures within a program that featured the prevention program. At various points in this study, the researchers also collaborated with stakeholders to help to develop good measures. Thus, this study illustrated a good, complex mixed methods project with an initial qualitative phase, an instrument development phase, and an experimental phase. It shows how an initial exploration qualitatively can be used to support a later quantitative testing phase. They stated the purpose of the study as follows:</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">In the multi-step process used in this mental health services research, we aimed to (1) carefully unpack locally-relevant indicators of mental health problems and protective resources using qualitative methods; (2) apply qualitative findings to the adaptation of mental health measures and the development of a locally-informed intervention; (3) validate the selected mental health measures; and (4) apply the measures to rigorous evaluation research on the effectiveness of the intervention chosen through the mixed methods process.

This study investigated the concept of social capital for men and women in households in a regional city in Australia. Social capital described norms and networks that enabled people to work collectively together to address and resolve common problems (e.g., through social activities, the community, and civic participation). The basic mixed methods approach was an explanatory sequential design with an initial survey, a quantitative phase, followed by an interview, qualitative phase. As stated by the author, “the qualitative study elaborated on and enhanced some of the results from the quantitative study” (p. 301). In addition, the author declared that this was a feminist mixed methods project. This means that Hodgkin used a feminist framework (see </span><a href="#calibre_link-9"><span class="calibre3">Chapter 3</span></a><span class="calibre3">) to encase the entire mixed methods project. She also referred to the Merten’s transformative research paradigm (Mertens, 2007) that gave voice to women, used a range of data collection methods, and bridged the subjective and objective ways of knowing (see the epistemology discussion in </span><a href="#calibre_link-9"><span class="calibre3">Chapter 3</span></a><span class="calibre3">). The purpose of the study was this:</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">The author will provide examples of quantitative data to demonstrate the existence of different social capital profiles for men and women. Stories will also be presented to provide a picture of gender inequality and expectation. The author will conclude by arguing that despite reluctance on the part of feminists to embrace quantitative methods, the big picture accompanied by the personal story can bring both depth and texture to a study. (p. 297)</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_43">Thus, in this mixed methods study, the <span class="italic">expected outcome</span> for the study was to help explain the initial survey results in more depth with qualitative interview data. Added to this would be the transformative perspective of seeking to provide a picture of gender inequality and expectations. The databases were used <span class="italic">sequentially</span> with the qualitative interviews following and expanding on the quantitative surveys. While the surveys were sent to both men and women in households (<span class="italic">N</span> = 1431), the interviews included only women in the survey sample (<span class="italic">N</span> = 12). The women interviewed were of different ages, they varied in terms of their work activities (inside and outside the home), they were mothers, and they varied in their educational level of attainment. The <span class="italic">timing</span> of the data collection was in two phases with the second-phase qualitative interviews building on the results from the first-phase quantitative surveys. In fact, the survey data indicated that men and women differed in terms of their level of social participation in groups, and in community group participation. The <span class="italic">emphasis</span> in this study seemed to be equal between the quantitative and qualitative components, and clearly the <span class="italic">sole author</span> of the study sought to provide a good example of mixed methods research that used a feminist framework.</p><p id="calibre_link-365" class="calibre_">How was this framework used? The author announced at the beginning of the study that “the aim of this article is to demonstrate the use of mixed methods in feminist research” (p. 296). Then the author discussed the lack of qualitative research in the empirical studies of social capital and noted the White, middle-class notion of community that dominated the discussions of social capital. Further, the author talked about lifting up the voices of those disenfranchised by gender and engaged in a study that first pointed out gender differences in social, community, and civic participation within a large sample of men and women, and then focused a qualitative follow-up on only women to understand the women’s role in more depth. The qualitative findings then addressed themes that influence women’s participation, such as wanting to be a “good mother,” wanting to avoid isolation, and wanting to be a good citizen. A summary of the qualitative findings indicates specifically how the qualitative data helped to enhance the findings of the initial survey results. Unlike many feminist mixed methods studies, the conclusion did not indicate a strong call for action to change the inequality. It only mentioned in passing that the mixed methods study provided a powerful voice to gender inequality.</p><blockquote id="calibre_link-212" class="calibre_32"><span class="calibre3">Summary</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35"><span class="calibre3">In designing the procedures for a mixed methods discussion, begin by defining mixed methods research and its core characteristics, briefly mentioning its historical evolution; discuss your chosen mixed methods design; and note the challenges in using the design. Convey a diagram of your procedures that includes good notation to help the reader understand the flow of activities. As you discuss your design, convey the elements that go into it, such as the procedures used in a convergent parallel, an explanatory sequential, or an exploratory sequential mixed methods study. Also consider whether you will overlay your project with a more complex procedure that embeds the data within a larger design, theoretical framework, or methodology. Finally, consider factors that play into your choice of a mixed methods design. These involve considering the intent of the design, what outcomes you expect from the study, the integration of the databases, the timing of them, the emphasis placed on each database, the choice of design that matches your field, and the conduct of the project either by yourself or a team of researchers.</span></blockquote><blockquote id="calibre_link-213" class="calibre_36"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre_37">

They also found that the studies varied in terms of the assumptions, strengths, and limitations of the method and whether they addressed different phenomena or the same phenomena; were implemented within the same or different paradigms; were given equal or different weight in the study; and were implemented independently, concurrently, or sequentially.
