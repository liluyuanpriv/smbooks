			<h1 id="calibre_link-23" class="chapter_title"><a id="calibre_link-24" class="calibre3"></a>Introduction</h1>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">C</span>ongratulations on choosing to take the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT)! By purchasing this book, you’ve taken an important step on your path to joining the military.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">This guide will provide you with a detailed overview of the AFOQT, so you know exactly what to expect on exam day. We’ll take you through all the concepts covered on the exam and give you the opportunity to test your knowledge with practice questions. Even if it’s been a while since you last took a major exam, don’t worry; we’ll make sure you’re more than ready!</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-25" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-26"></a>What is the AFOQT?</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Under the purview of the US Air Force, the AFOQT is a comprehensive exam used to measure aptitudes of candidates aspiring to enter the Air Force as an officer. This exam assesses candidates for acceptance into one of the Air Force commissioning programs. These programs include the Air Force Military Academy, Air Force Officer Training School (OTS), and the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (Air Force ROTC). Results from this exam also determine a candidate’s qualification for attendance to pilot and navigator training courses as well as nonaviation officer positions.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The AFOQT, written by several subject matter experts, ensures the US Air Force recruits candidates that possess certain knowledge to meet the fundamental, rigid standards required of the modern and technical positions they will encounter as Air Force commissioned officers.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Only high school students applying for attendance in the US Air Force Military Academy, college students enrolled in their university ROTC program, and college graduates with bachelor’s degrees are considered eligible to take the AFOQT.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-27" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-28"></a>What’s on the AFOQT?</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The AFOQT is broken down into twelve subtests. The entire exam is multiple choice, providing four or five possible answers with one being the correct or best answer. The exam is scored based on the total number of questions answered correctly. Therefore, test-takers are not penalized for guessing. Prior to starting some of the subtests, you may have the opportunity to answer some practice questions to ensure you understand what you are supposed to do. The exam itself requires three hours and thirty-six minutes; however, be prepared to allow at least five hours to account for administrative instruction, time between subtests, and two scheduled breaks.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Candidates must complete all subtests of the AFOQT, even if they are not applying to attend the pilot and navigator training courses. The subtests, approximate number of questions in each subtest, and the time allowed are shown in the following table. </p>

			<h2 id="calibre_link-31" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-32"></a>How is the AFOQT Scored?</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Each subtest score is quantified in a percentile ranking between 0 and 99 percent. This ranking is relative to your score ranked against other candidates who took the same subtest. After each subtest is computed, certain subtest scores are combined to correlate into a composite score for one of six separate categories: Verbal, Quantitative (Math), Academic Aptitude, Pilot, Combat Systems Operator (CSO), and Air Battle Manager (ABM). The Situational Judgment test is its own composite score category. While all six composite scores are used to determine eligibility for pilot and other aviation training courses, only the Verbal, Academic Aptitude, Situational Judgment, and Quantitative (Math) categories are used for nonaviation candidates. Due to the concentrated skill required for pilot and CSO positions, candidates must score higher in all categories to be eligible for attendance in the aviation training courses. The following covers how to attain a composite score for each category.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Verbal</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">To become an Air Force officer in any nonaviation position, you must score at least 15 in this subtest. The composite score for this category is a combination of Verbal Analogies, Word Knowledge, and Reading Comprehension. This category identifies candidates with strong understanding of language, grammar, and literature.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Quantitative</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">To become an Air Force officer in any nonaviation position, you must score at least 10 in this subtest. The composite score for this category is a combination of Arithmetic Reasoning and Math Knowledge. This category identifies candidates with a strong mathematical background understanding formulas, proportions, and ratios.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Academic Aptitude</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The composite score for this category is a combination of Verbal Analogies, Arithmetic Reasoning, Word Knowledge, and Math Knowledge. This category identifies candidates with a broad academic knowledge. There is no minimum score in this category to be eligible to become an Air Force officer.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Pilot</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The composite score for this category is a combination of Math Knowledge, Table Reading, Instrument Comprehension, and Aviation Information. This category identifies those candidates with particular talent in understanding aviation concepts, analyzing aeronautical charts, and possessing a quick response to surroundings. Candidates applying to become a pilot must score a minimum of 25 in this category. Candidates applying to become a CSO must score a minimum of 10 in this category. This category is not considered if applying to a nonaviation training course.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">CSO</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The composite score for this category is a combination of Word Knowledge, Math Knowledge, Table Reading, and Block Counting. This category identifies those candidates with technical aptitude in spatial ability coupled with verbal skill. Candidates applying to become a pilot must score a minimum of 10 in this category. Candidates applying to become a CSO must score a minimum of 25 in this category. There is no minimum score in this category if applying to a nonaviation training course.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Although the minimum Pilot and CSO composite scores for pilot and other aviation training course candidates are 25 and 10, respectively, candidates must attain a combined total composite score of 50 from the Pilot and CSO categories.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">ABM</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The composite score for this category is a combination of Verbal Analogies, Math Knowledge, Table Reading, Instrument Comprehension, Block Counting, and Aviation Information. This category identifies those candidates with particular technical competence in spatial ability, analyzing aeronautical charts, ability to recognize aircraft attitude, and verbal aptitude. There is no minimum score in this category to be eligible to become an Air Force officer.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Situational Judgment</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The score for this category is taken from the Situational Judgment test. There is no minimum score in this category to be eligible to become an Air Force officer.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Although there is no minimum score for certain composite categories, the Air Force balances recruitment quotas by selecting candidates who attain the highest scores on the AFOQT. It is in your best interest to prepare for this test by studying and completing practice sample exam questions, especially in subtests that are not your strongest areas.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-33" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-34"></a>Retaking the AFOQT</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The AFOQT may be taken twice in your lifetime. The retake exam must be taken after 180 days from the date of the initial exam. The most recent AFOQT score is used, not the highest score between the two exams. The AFOQT score is valid for life; however, the Air Force has a maximum age requirement at time of commissioning.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-35" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-36"></a>How is the AFOQT Administered?</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">If you are ready to take the AFOQT, contact your local recruiter. Your officer recruiter will determine your initial eligibility to apply for officer schooling or to join the Air Force as an officer and schedule you for the AFOQT.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">On the day of the exam, you will need to bring valid photo identification. Testing materials are provided by the test proctor. Calculators are not allowed. Personal breaks are scheduled by the proctor. The proctor will provide all instructions for taking the exam, such as when to start and stop, and will allow practice questions as applicable. During the practice questions, the proctor cannot provide information on the question, possible answers, or test-taking strategies.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-37" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-38"></a>Getting to Know the United States Air Force</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The US Air Force is tasked with missions to provide the global air support through superior air power for intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The Air Force allows the United States to swiftly respond to threats and protect our national interests worldwide. The Air Force also leads the space and missile program, requiring various positions from combat crew operators to astronauts.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The rank structure of the Air Force consists of enlisted and officers, and it is similar to that of the US Army. The AFOQT only applies to individuals pursuing a career as a US Air Force officer. The US Air Force offers officer careers in the following fields: aviation, computer science, space command, munitions, command and control, intelligence, health, operations support, logistics, and more. Once you are determined to be qualified for a career field, the Air Force provides you with the training necessary to carry out the duties and responsibilities.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-39" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-40"></a>The Military Recruitment Process</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">As stated before, passing the AFOQT is just one requirement to qualify for military service as an officer in the US Air Force. You may contact your local recruiter through your high school counselor or college adviser, or visit your local military recruitment center.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Once you contact your local recruiter, he or she will meet with you at the recruiting office, your school, or your home. During this meeting, the recruiter will conduct an interview to initiate the recruitment process. This process begins with the recruiter determining if you meet the basic qualification requirements. Expect a review of your education level, financial record, background investigation, interests, criminal record or drug history, height and weight, age, and citizenship. Once basic qualifications have been established, the recruiter refers you to an officer recruiter who will schedule you to take the AFOQT and a physical exam. After this, you will meet with your officer recruiter to discuss your AFOQT scores and any medical issue that may preclude your entrance to an officer commissioning school leading to an appointment as an officer. During this meeting, the officer recruiter will discuss which branch(es) of service you qualify for and possible career options for you to choose from. Your recruiter can respond to any concerns or questions you have along the way.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-41" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-42"></a>About This Guide</h2>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">A</span>n analogy compares two things, identifying an important way or ways the two are alike. The type of analogy in this test presents four items arranged in two pairs. For example:</p>
			<p class="body_text_example"><span class="underline">HAND is to ARM</span> as <span class="underline">FOOT is to LEG</span></p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="underline">HAND and ARM</span> is the first pair. <span class="underline">FOOT and LEG</span> is the second pair. The two items in Pair 1 have the same relationship that the two items in Pair 2 have. In this case, it is a part-to-whole relationship: a HAND is part of an ARM, just as a FOOT is part of a LEG.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">There are twenty-five items on this analogy test. Each is multiple-choice and has five answer choices labeled (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). The first section is structured so that only one word needs to be filled in:</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading_no_space">Synonyms and Antonyms</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="bold">Synonyms</span> are words with identical or similar meanings. For example, <span class="italic">identical</span> and <span class="italic">alike</span> are synonyms. <span class="bold">Antonyms</span> are words with opposite meanings. For example, <span class="italic">opposite</span> and <span class="italic">matching</span> are antonyms.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In a <span class="bold">synonym analogy</span>, the two words in each pair are synonyms. For example:</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="italic">Confusing</span> and <span class="italic">perplexing</span> are synonyms (have the same or similar meaning), and <span class="italic">intelligent</span> and <span class="italic">brainy</span> are synonyms, too.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In an<span class="bold"> antonym analogy</span>, the two words in each pair are antonyms. For example:</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Actions and Functions</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">In an <span class="bold">action analogy</span>, each pair contains a noun (person, animal, or thing) and a verb that describes an action that person, animal, or thing commonly performs. For example:</p>

			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> You can use the tone of the words in an analogy to help fill in the missing parts. For example, SAD and DESPONDENT are both negative words. Because HAPPY is a positive word, the second word in the pair should also be positive.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The example below also shows a relationship of degree/amount:</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">factors</span> of a natural number are all the numbers that can multiply together to make the number. For example, the factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Every natural number is either prime or composite. A <span class="bold">prime number</span> is a number that is only divisible by itself and 1. (The number 1 is not considered prime.) Examples of prime numbers are 2, 3, 7, and 29. The number 2 is the only even prime number. A <span class="bold">composite number</span> has more than two factors. For example, 6 is composite because its factors are 1, 6, 2, and 3. Every composite number can be written as a unique product of prime numbers, called the <span class="bold">prime factorization</span> of the number. For example, the prime factorization of 90 is 90 = 2 × 3<span class="super">2</span> × 5. All integers are either even or odd. An even number is divisible by 2; an odd number is not.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Properties of Number Systems</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">A system is <span class="bold">closed</span> under an operation if performing that operation on two elements of the system results in another element of that system. For example, the integers are closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication but not division. Adding, subtracting, or multiplying two integers results in another integer. However, dividing two integers could result in a rational number that is not an integer [−2 ÷ 3 = (−2/3)].</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The rational numbers are closed under all four operations (except for division by 0).</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The real numbers are closed under all four operations.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The complex numbers are closed under all four operations.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The irrational numbers are NOT closed under ANY of the four operations.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">commutative property</span> holds for an operation if order does not matter when performing the operation. For example, multiplication is commutative for integers: (−2)(3) = (3)(−2).</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">associative property</span> holds for an operation if elements can be regrouped without changing the result. For example, addition is associative for real numbers: −3 + (−5 + 4) = (−3 + −5) + 4.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">distributive property</span> of multiplication over addition allows a product of sums to be written as a sum of products: <span class="italic">a</span>(<span class="italic">b</span> + <span class="italic">c</span>)  = <span class="italic">ab</span> +  <span class="italic">ac</span>. The value <span class="italic">a</span> is distributed over the sum (<span class="italic">b</span> + <span class="italic">c</span>). The acronym FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) is a useful way to remember the distributive property.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">When an operation is performed with an <span class="bold">identity element</span> and another element <span class="italic">a</span>, the result is <span class="italic">a</span>. The identity element for multiplication on real numbers is 1 (<span class="italic">a</span> × 1 = <span class="italic">a</span>), and for addition is 0 (<span class="italic">a</span> + 0 = <span class="italic">a</span>).</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">An operation of a system has an <span class="bold">inverse element</span> if applying that operation with the inverse element results in the identity element. For example, the inverse element of <span class="italic">a</span> for addition is −<span class="italic">a</span> because <span class="italic">a</span> + (−<span class="italic">a</span>) = 0. The inverse element of <span class="italic">a</span> for multiplication is 1/<span class="italic">a</span> because <span class="italic">a</span> × 1/<span class="italic">a</span> = 1.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">A <span class="bold">fraction</span> is a number that can be written in the form (<span class="italic">a</span>/<span class="italic">b</span>), where <span class="italic">b</span> is not equal to 0. The <span class="italic">a</span> part of the fraction is the <span class="bold">numerator</span> (top number) and the <span class="italic">b</span> part of the fraction is the <span class="bold">denominator</span> (bottom number).</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">If the denominator of a fraction is greater than the numerator, the value of the fraction is less than 1 and it is called a <span class="bold">proper fraction</span> (for example, 3/5 is a proper fraction). In an <span class="bold">improper fraction</span>, the denominator is less than the numerator and the value of the fraction is greater than 1 (8/3 is an improper fraction). An improper fraction can be written as a <span class="bold">mixed number</span>, which has a whole number part and a proper fraction part. Improper fractions can be converted to mixed numbers by dividing the numerator by the denominator, which gives the whole number part, and the remainder becomes the numerator of the proper fraction part. (For example, the improper fraction (25/9) is equal to mixed number 2(7/9) because 9 divides into 25 two times, with a remainder of 7.)</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Conversely, mixed numbers can be converted to improper fractions. To do so, determine the numerator of the improper fraction by multiplying the denominator by the whole number, and then adding the numerator.

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Fractions with the same denominator can be added or subtracted by simply adding or subtracting the numerators; the denominator will remain unchanged. To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, find the <span class="bold">least common denominator (LCD)</span> of all the fractions. The LCD is the smallest number exactly divisible by each denominator. (For example, the least common denominator of the numbers 2, 3, and 8 is 24.) Once the LCD has been found, each fraction should be written in an equivalent form with the LCD as the denominator. </p>

A percent can be converted to a fraction by writing the percent as a fraction with 100 as the denominator and reducing. A fraction can be converted to a percent by performing the indicated division, multiplying the result by 100, and attaching the % sign.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The <span class="bold">absolute value </span>of a number means the distance between that number and zero. The absolute value of any number is positive since distance is always positive. The notation for absolute value of a number is two vertical bars:</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Measures of central tendency help identify the center, or most typical, value within a data set. There are three such central tendencies that describe the “center” of the data in different ways. The <span class="bold">mean</span> is the arithmetic average and is found by dividing the sum of all measurements by the number of measurements. The mean of a population is written as <span class="italic">μ</span> and the mean of a sample is written as <span class="line_above_italic">x</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_example"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute10" src="images/00166.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body_text_example"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute11" src="images/00024.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The data points are represented by <span class="italic">x'</span>s with subscripts; the sum is denoted using the Greek letter sigma (∑); <span class="italic">N</span> is the number of data points in the entire population; and <span class="italic">n</span> is the number of data points in a sample set.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">median</span> divides the measurements into two equal halves. The median is the measurement right in the middle of an odd set of measurements or the average of the two middle numbers in an even data set. When calculating the median, it is important to order the data values from least to greatest before attempting to locate the middle value. The <span class="bold">mode</span> is simply the measurement that occurs most often. There can be many modes in a data set, or no mode. Since measures of central tendency describe a <span class="italic">center</span> of the data, all three of these measures will be between the lowest and highest data values (inclusive).</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> When the same value is added to each term in a set, the mean increases by that value and the standard deviation is unchanged. When each term in a set is multiplied by the same value, both the mean and standard deviation will also be multiplied by that value.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Unusually large or small values, called <span class="bold">outliers</span>, will affect the mean of a sample more than the mode. If there is a high outlier, the mean will be greater than the median; if there is a low outlier, the mean will be lower than the median. When outliers are present, the median is a better measure of the data's center than the mean because the median will be closer to the terms in the data set. </p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The values in a data set can be very close together (close to the mean), or very spread out. This is called the <span class="bold">spread</span> or <span class="bold">dispersion</span> of the data. There are a few <span class="bold">measures of variation</span> (or <span class="bold">measures of dispersion</span>) that quantify the spread within a data set. <span class="bold">Range</span> is the difference between the largest and smallest data points in a set:</p>
			<p class="body_text_example"><span class="italic">R</span> = <span class="italic">largest data point</span> − <span class="italic">smallest data point</span></p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Notice range depends on only two data points (the two extremes). Sometimes these data points are outliers; regardless, for a large data set, relying on only two data points is not an exact tool.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The understanding of the data set can be improved by calculating <span class="bold">quartiles</span>. To calculate quartiles, first arrange the data in ascending order and find the set’s median (also called quartile 2 or Q2). Then find the median of the lower half of the data, called quartile 1 (Q1), and the median of the upper half of the data, called quartile 3 (Q3). These three points divide the data into four equal groups of data (thus the word <span class="italic">quartile</span>). Each quartile contains 25% of the data.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Interquartile range (IQR)</span> provides a more reliable range that is not as affected by extremes. IQR is the difference between the third quartile data point and the first quartile data point and gives the spread of the middle 50% of the data:</p>
			<p class="body_text_example"><span class="italic">IQR</span> = <span class="italic">Q</span><span class="sub">3</span> − <span class="italic">Q</span><span class="sub">1</span></p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A measure of variation that depends on the mean is <span class="bold">standard deviation</span>, which uses every data point in a set and calculates the average distance of each data point from the mean of the data. Standard deviation can be computed for an entire population (written <span class="italic">σ</span>) or for a sample of a population (written <span class="italic">s</span>):</p>
			<p class="body_text_example"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute12" src="images/00055.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body_text_example"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute13" src="images/00084.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Thus, to calculate standard deviation, the difference between the mean and each data point is calculated. Each of these differences is squared (so that each is positive). The average of the squared values is computed by summing the squares and dividing by <span class="italic">N</span> or (<span class="italic">n</span> − 1). Then the square root is taken, to “undo” the previous squaring.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">variance</span> of a data set is simply the square of the standard variation:</p>
			<p class="body_text_example"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute14" src="images/00116.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Variance measures how narrowly or widely the data points are distributed. A variance of zero means every data point is the same; a large variance means there are a relatively small amount of data points near the set’s mean.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Standard deviation and variance are also affected by extreme values. Though much simpler to calculate, interquartile range is the more accurate depiction of how the data is scattered when there are outlier values.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Probability describes how likely something is to happen.

The collection of all possible outcomes for a particular trial is called the <span class="bold">sample space</span>. For example, when rolling a die, the sample space is the numbers 1 &ndash; 6. Rolling a single number, such as 4, would be a single event.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Probability of a Single Event</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The probability of a single event occurring is the number of outcomes in which that event occurs (called <span class="bold">favorable events</span>) divided by the number of items in the sample space (total possible outcomes):</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The probability of any event occurring will always be a fraction or decimal between 0 and 1. It may also be expressed as a percent.

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">If events are <span class="bold">independent</span>, the probability of one occurring does not affect the probability of the other event occurring.

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">If events are <span class="bold">dependent</span>, the probability of one occurring changes the probability of the other event occurring.

			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> When drawing objects, the phrase <span class="italic">with replacement</span> describes independent events, and <span class="italic">without replacement</span> describes dependent events.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="bold">Arithmetic growth</span> is constant growth, meaning that the difference between any one term in the series and the next consecutive term will be the same constant. This constant is called the <span class="bold">common difference</span>. Thus, to list the terms in the sequence, one can just add (or subtract) the same number repeatedly. For example, the series {20, 30, 40, 50} is arithmetic since 10 is added each time to get from one term to the next. One way to represent this sequence is using a <span class="bold">recursive </span>definition, which basically says: <span class="italic">next term </span>= <span class="italic">current term </span>+ <span class="italic">common difference</span>. For this example, the recursive definition would be <span class="italic">a</span><span class="sub_italic">n</span><span class="sub"> + 1</span> = <span class="italic">a</span><span class="sub_italic">n</span> + 10 because the <span class="italic">next </span>term <span class="italic">a</span><span class="sub_italic">n</span><span class="sub"> + 1</span> in the sequence is the current term <span class="italic">a</span><span class="sub_italic">n</span> plus 10.

The correct answer will be the choice whose meaning most closely matches the definition of the given word. It’s a fast-moving section: questions need to be answered in fewer than fifteen seconds. Having a large vocabulary will obviously help with this section, but there are strategies that can be used to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words. </p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-102" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-103"></a>Word Structure</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">In addition to the context of a sentence or passage, an unfamiliar word itself can provide clues about its meaning. A word consists of discrete pieces that determine its meaning; these pieces include word roots, prefixes, and suffixes.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Word roots</span> are the bases from which many words take their form and meaning. The most common word roots are Greek and Latin, and a broad knowledge of these roots can make it much easier to determine the meaning of words. The root of a word does not always point to the word’s exact meaning, but combined with an understanding of the word’s place in a sentence, it will often be enough to answer a question about meaning or relationships.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Math Knowledge section includes 25 questions to be answered in 22 minutes. The questions cover a broad range of topics, including operations with exponents and radicals, equations and inequalities, and properties of geometric figures. In addition, many of the basic operations tested in the Arithmetic Reasoning section may be needed to answer Math Knowledge questions.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-116" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-117"></a>Algebraic Expressions</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The foundation of algebra is the <span class="bold">variable</span>, an unknown number represented by a symbol (usually a letter such as <span class="italic">x</span> or <span class="italic">a</span>). Variables can be preceded by a <span class="bold">coefficient</span>, which is a constant (i.e., a real number) in front of the variable, such as 4<span class="italic">x</span> or −2<span class="italic">a</span>. An <span class="bold">algebraic expression</span> is any sum, difference, product, or quotient of variables and numbers (for example 3<span class="italic">x</span><span class="super">2</span>, 2<span class="italic">x</span> + 7<span class="italic">y</span> − 1, and 5/<span class="italic">x</span> are algebraic expressions). <span class="bold">Terms</span> are any quantities that are added or subtracted (for example, the terms of the expression <span class="italic">x</span><span class="super">2</span> − 3<span class="italic">x</span> + 5 are <span class="italic">x</span><span class="super">2</span>, 3<span class="italic">x</span>, and 5). A <span class="bold">polynomial expression</span> is an algebraic expression where all the exponents on the variables are whole numbers. A polynomial with only two terms is known as a <span class="bold">binomial</span>, and one with three terms is a <span class="bold">trinomial</span>. A <span class="bold">monomial</span> has only one term.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Evaluating expressions</span> is another way of saying “find the numeric value of an expression if the variable is equal to a certain number.” To evaluate the expression, simply plug the given value(s) for the variable(s) into the equation and simplify. Remember to use the order of operations when simplifying: </p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading_no_space">Adding and Subtracting</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Expressions can be added or subtracted by simply adding and subtracting <span class="bold">like terms</span>, which are terms with the same variable part (the variables must be the same, with the same exponents on each variable). For example, in the expressions 2<span class="italic">x</span> + 3<span class="italic">xy</span> − 2<span class="italic">z </span>and 6<span class="italic">y</span> + 2<span class="italic">xy</span>, the like terms are 3<span class="italic">xy</span> and 2<span class="italic">xy</span>. Adding the two expressions yields the new expression 2<span class="italic">x</span> + 5<span class="italic">xy</span> − 2<span class="italic">z</span> + 6<span class="italic">y</span>. Note that the other terms did not change; they cannot be combined because they have different variables.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Example</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">2.	</span>If <span class="italic">a</span> = 12<span class="italic">x</span> + 7<span class="italic">xy</span> &ndash; 9<span class="italic">y</span> and <span class="italic">b</span> = 8<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 9<span class="italic">xz</span> + 7<span class="italic">z</span>, what is <span class="italic">a</span> + <span class="italic">b</span>?</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Distributing and Factoring</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Distributing and factoring can be seen as two sides of the same coin. <span class="bold">Distribution</span> multiplies each term in the first factor by each term in the second factor to get rid of parentheses. <span class="bold">Factoring</span> reverses this process, taking a polynomial in standard form and writing it as a product of two or more factors.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Operations with polynomials can always be checked by evaluating equivalent expressions for the same value.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">When distributing a monomial through a polynomial, the expression outside the parentheses is multiplied by each term inside the parentheses. Using the rules of exponents, coefficients are multiplied and exponents are added.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">When simplifying two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial must multiply each term in the second polynomial. A binomial (two terms) multiplied by a binomial, will require 2 × 2 or 4 multiplications. For the binomial × binomial case, this process is sometimes called <span class="bold">FOIL</span>, which stands for first, outside, inside, and last. These terms refer to the placement of each term of the expression: multiply the first term in each expression, then the outside terms, then the inside terms, and finally the last terms. A binomial (two terms) multiplied by a trinomial (three terms), will require 2 × 3 or 6 products to simplify. The first term in the first polynomial multiplies each of the three terms in the second polynomial, then the second term in the first polynomial multiplies each of the three terms in the second polynomial. A trinomial (three terms) by a trinomial will require 3 × 3 or 9 products, and so on.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Factoring is the reverse of distributing: the first step is always to remove (“undistribute”) the GCF of all the terms, if there is a GCF (besides 1). The GCF is the product of any constants and/or variables that <span class="underline">every</span> term shares. (For example, the GCF of 12<span class="italic">x</span><span class="super">3</span>, 15<span class="italic">x</span><span class="super">2</span> and 6<span class="italic">xy</span><span class="super">2</span> is 3<span class="italic">x</span> because 3<span class="italic">x</span> evenly divides all three terms.) This shared factor can be taken out of each term and moved to the outside of the parentheses, leaving behind a polynomial where each term is the original term divided by the GCF. (The remaining terms for the terms in the example would be 4<span class="italic">x</span><span class="super">2</span>, 5<span class="italic">x</span>, and 2<span class="italic">y</span><span class="super">2</span>.) It may be possible to factor the polynomial in the parentheses further, depending on the problem.</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">3.	</span>Expand the following expression: 5<span class="italic">x</span>(<span class="italic">x</span><span class="super">2</span> − 2<span class="italic">c</span> + 10)</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">4.	</span>Expand the following expression: (<span class="italic">x</span><span class="super">2</span> − 5)(2<span class="italic">x</span> − <span class="italic">x</span><span class="super">3</span>)</p>

			<h2 id="calibre_link-121" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-122"></a>Linear Equations</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">An <span class="bold">equation</span> states that two expressions are equal to each other. Polynomial equations are categorized by the highest power of the variables they contain: the highest power of any exponent of a linear equation is 1, a quadratic equation has a variable raised to the second power, a cubic equation has a variable raised to the third power, and so on.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Solving Linear Equations</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Solving an equation means finding the value or values of the variable that make the equation true. To solve a linear equation, it is necessary to manipulate the terms so that the variable being solved for appears alone on one side of the equal sign while everything else in the equation is on the other side. </p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> On multiple-choice tests, it’s often easier to plug the possible values into the equation and determine which solution makes the equation true than it is to solve the equation.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The way to solve linear equations is to “undo” all the operations that connect numbers to the variable of interest. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol class="calibre1">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ol">Eliminate fractions by multiplying each side by the least common multiple of any denominators.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ol">Distribute to eliminate parentheses, braces, and brackets.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ol">Combine like terms.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ol">Use addition or subtraction to collect all terms containing the variable of interest to one side, and all terms not containing the variable to the other side.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ol">Use multiplication or division to remove coefficients from the variable of interest.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Sometimes there are no numeric values in the equation or there are a mix of numerous variables and constants. The goal is to solve the equation for one of the variables in terms of the other variables. In this case, the answer will be an expression involving numbers and letters instead of a numeric value.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Examples</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">7.	</span>Solve for <span class="italic">x</span>: 100 (<span class="italic">x</span> + 5)/20 = 1</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">8.	</span>Solve for <span class="italic">x</span>: 2(<span class="italic">x</span> + 2)<span class="super">2</span> − 2<span class="italic">x</span><span class="super">2</span> + 10 = 42</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">9.	</span>Solve the equation for <span class="italic">D</span>: <span class="italic">A</span>(3<span class="italic">B</span> + 2<span class="italic">D</span>)/2<span class="italic">N</span> = 5<span class="italic">M</span> − 6</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Graphs of Linear Equations</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The most common way to write a linear equation is <span class="bold">slope-intercept</span><span class="bold"> form</span>, <span class="italic">y</span> = <span class="italic">mx</span> + <span class="italic">b</span>. In this equation, <span class="italic">m</span> is the slope, which describes how steep the line is, and <span class="italic">b</span> is the <span class="italic">y</span>-intercept. Slope is often described as “rise over run” because it is calculated as the difference in <span class="italic">y</span>-values (rise) over the difference in <span class="italic">x</span>-values (run). The slope of the line is also the rate of change of the dependent variable <span class="italic">y</span> with respect to the independent variable <span class="italic">x</span>. The <span class="italic">y</span>-intercept is the point where the line crosses the <span class="italic">y</span>-axis, or where <span class="italic">x</span> equals zero. </p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Use the phrase “Begin, Move” to remember that <span class="italic">b</span> is the <span class="italic">y</span>-intercept (where to begin) and <span class="italic">m</span> is the slope (how the line moves).</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To graph a linear equation, identify the <span class="italic">y</span>-intercept and place that point on the <span class="italic">y</span>-axis. If the slope is not written as a fraction, make it a fraction by writing it over 1 (<span class="italic">m</span>/1). Then use the slope to count up (or down, if negative) the “rise” part of the slope and over the “run” part of the slope to find a second point. These points can then be connected to draw the line. </p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To find the equation of a line, identify the <span class="italic">y</span>-intercept, if possible, on the graph and use two easily identifiable points to find the slope. If the <span class="italic">y</span>-intercept is not easily identified, identify the slope by choosing easily identifiable points; then choose one point on the graph, plug the point and the slope values into the equation, and solve for the missing value <span class="italic">b</span>.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Another way to express a linear equation is standard form: <span class="italic">Ax</span> + <span class="italic">By</span> = <span class="italic">C</span>. In order to graph equations in this form, it is often easiest to convert them to point-slope form. Alternately, it is easy to find the <span class="italic">x</span>- or <span class="italic">y</span>-intercept from this form, and once these two points are known, a line can be drawn through them. To find the <span class="italic">x</span>-intercept, simply make <span class="italic">y</span> = 0 and solve for <span class="italic">x</span>. Similarly, to find the <span class="italic">y</span>-intercept, make <span class="italic">x</span> = 0 and solve for <span class="italic">y</span>.</p>

				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">≤ less than or equal to</li>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Inequalities are read from left to right. For example, the inequality <span class="italic">x</span> <span class="underline">&lt;</span> 8 would be read as “<span class="italic">x</span> is less than or equal to 8,” meaning <span class="italic">x</span> has a value smaller than or equal to 8. The set of solutions of an inequality can be expressed using a number line. The shaded region on the number line represents the set of all the numbers that make an inequality true. One major difference between equations and inequalities is that equations generally have a finite number of solutions, while inequalities generally have infinitely many solutions (an entire interval on the number line containing infinitely many values).</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading_no_space">Basic Definitions</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The basic figures from which many other geometric shapes are built are points, lines, and planes. A <span class="bold">point</span> is a location in a plane. It has no size or shape, but is represented by a dot. It is labeled using a capital letter.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">line</span> is a one-dimensional collection of points that extends infinitely in both directions. At least two points are needed to define a line, and any points that lie on the same line are <span class="bold">colinear</span>. Lines are represented by two points, such as <span class="bold_italic">A</span> and <span class="bold_italic">B</span>, and the line symbol: <img class="_idgenobjectattribute29" src="images/00086.jpeg" alt="" />. Two lines on the same plane will intersect unless they are <span class="bold">parallel</span>, meaning they have the same slope. Lines that intersect at a 90 degree angle are <span class="bold">perpendicular</span>. </p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">line segment</span> has two endpoints and a finite length. The length of a segment, called the measure of the segment, is the distance from <span class="bold_italic">A</span> to <span class="bold_italic">B</span>. A line segment is a subset of a line, and is also denoted with two points, but with a segment symbol: <img class="_idgenobjectattribute30" src="images/00025.jpeg" alt="" />. The <span class="bold">midpoint</span> of a line segment is the point at which the segment is divided into two equal parts.

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">ray</span> has one endpoint and extends indefinitely in one direction.

A plane is a two-dimensional (2D) figure. A plane can always be defined through any three noncollinear points in three-dimensional (3D) space. A plane is named using any three points that are in the plane (for example, plane <span class="bold_italic">ABC</span>).

They can also be labeled with a number or named by their vertex alone (if it is clear to do so). Angles are also classified based on their angle measure.

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Any two angles that add to make 90° are called <span class="bold">complementary angles</span>. A 30° angle would be complementary to a 60° angle. <span class="bold">Supplementary angles</span> add up to 180°. A supplementary angle to a 60° angle would be a 120° angle; likewise, 60° is the <span class="bold">supplement</span> of 120°. The complement and supplement of any angle must always be positive. For example, a 140 degree has no complement. Angles that are next to each other and share a common ray are called <span class="bold">adjacent angles</span>. Angles that are adjacent and supplementary are called a <span class="bold">linear pair</span> of angles. Their nonshared rays form a line (thus the <span class="italic">linear</span> pair).

			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> <span class="italic">Trying to square a circle</span> means attempting to create a square that has the same area as a circle.

The phrase is often used to describe trying to do something that can’t be done.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter is a constant value called pi (<span class="italic">π</span>), an irrational number which is commonly rounded to 3.14. The formula to find a circle’s circumference is <span class="italic">C</span> = 2<span class="italic">πr</span>. The formula to find the enclosed area of a circle is <span class="italic">A</span> = <span class="italic">πr</span><span class="super">2</span>.</p>

				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">A line that touches a circle or any curve at one point is <span class="bold">tangent</span> to the circle or the curve.

				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">An <span class="bold">arc</span> is any portion of a circle between two points on the circle.

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Solving for missing angles or sides of a triangle is a common type of triangle problem. Often a right triangle will come up on its own or within another triangle.

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The two polygons depicted above are <span class="bold">regular polygons</span>, meaning that they are equilateral (all sides having equal lengths) and equiangular (all angles having equal measurements). Angles inside a polygon are <span class="bold">interior angles</span>, whereas those formed by one side of the polygon and a line extending outside the polygon are <span class="bold">exterior angles</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Breaking an irregular polygon down into triangles and quadrilaterals helps in finding its area.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The sum of all the exterior angles of a polygon is always 360°. Dividing 360° by the number of a polygon’s sides finds the measure of the polygon’s exterior angles.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To determine the sum of a polygon’s interior angles, choose one vertex and draw diagonals from that vertex to each of the other vertices, decomposing the polygon into multiple triangles. For example, an octagon has six triangles within it, and therefore the sum of the interior angles is 6 × 180° = 1080°. In general, the formula for finding the sum of the angles in a polygon is <span class="italic">sum of angles</span> = (<span class="italic">n</span> − 2) × 180°, where <span class="italic">n</span> is the number of sides of the polygon.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To find the measure of a single interior angle in a regular polygon, simply divide the sum of the interior angles by the number of angles (which is the same as the number of sides). So, in the octagon example, each angle is (1080/8) = 135°.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In general, the formula to find the measure of a regular polygon’s interior angles is: <span class="italic">interior angle</span> = [(<span class="italic">n</span> − 2)/<span class="italic">n</span>] × 180˚where <span class="italic">n</span> is the number of sides of the polygon. </p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To find the area of a polygon, it is helpful to know the perimeter of the polygon (<span class="italic">p</span>), and the <span class="bold">apothem</span> (<span class="italic">a</span>). The apothem is the shortest (perpendicular) distance from the polygon’s center to one of the sides of the polygon. The formula for the area is: <span class="italic">area</span> = <span class="italic">ap</span>/2.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Finally, there is no universal way to find the perimeter of a polygon (when the side length is not given). Often, breaking the polygon down into triangles and adding the base of each triangle all the way around the polygon is the easiest way to calculate the perimeter.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he AFOQT Paragraph Comprehension section includes short reading passages followed by questions about those passages. The passages will cover simple, easy-to-understand topics, and no outside knowledge will be needed to answer the questions. The sections below will introduce the types of questions that are included in the Paragraph Comprehension section and explain how to answer them.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-160" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-161"></a>The Main Idea</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The <span class="bold">main idea</span> of a text describes the author’s main topic and general concept; it also generalizes the author’s point of view about a subject. It is contained within and throughout the text. The reader can easily find the main idea by considering how the main topic is addressed throughout a passage. In the reading test, the expectation is not only to identify the main idea but also to differentiate it from a text’s theme and to summarize the main idea clearly and concisely.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The main idea is closely connected to topic sentences and how they are supported in a text. Questions may deal with finding topic sentences, summarizing a text’s ideas, or locating supporting details. The sections and practice examples that follow detail the distinctions between these aspects of text.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> The author’s perspective on the subject of the text and how he or she has framed the argument or story hints at the main idea. For example, if the author framed the story with a description, image, or short anecdote, this suggests a particular idea or point of view.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Identifying the Main Idea</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">To identify the main idea, first identify the topic. The difference between these two things is simple: the <span class="bold">topic</span> is the overall subject matter of a passage; the main idea is what the author wants to say about that topic. The main idea covers the author’s direct perspective about a topic, as distinct from the <span class="bold">theme</span>, which is a generally true idea that the reader might derive from a text. Most of the time, fiction has a theme, whereas nonfiction has a main idea. This is the case because in a nonfiction text, the author speaks more directly to the audience about a topic&mdash;his or her perspective is more visible. For example, the following passage conveys the topic as well as what the author wants to communicate about that topic.</p>
			<p class="body_text_indented-paragraph">The “shark mania” of recent years can be largely pinned on the sensationalistic media surrounding the animals: from the release of <span class="italic">Jaws</span> in 1975 to the week of ultra-hyped shark feeding frenzies and “worst shark attacks” countdowns known as Shark Week, popular culture both demonizes and fetishizes sharks until the public cannot get enough. Swimmers and beachgoers may look nervously for the telltale fin skimming the surface, but the reality is that shark bites are extremely rare and they are almost never unprovoked. Sharks attack people at very predictable times and for very predictable reasons. Rough surf, poor visibility, or a swimmer sending visual and physical signals that mimic a shark’s normal prey are just a few examples.</p>
			<p class="body_text_indented-paragraph">Of course, some places are just more dangerous to swim. Shark attack “hot spots,” such as the coasts of Florida, South Africa, and New Zealand try a variety of solutions to protect tourists and surfers. Some beaches employ “shark nets,” meant to keep sharks away from the beach, though these are controversial because they frequently trap other forms of marine life as well. Other beaches use spotters in helicopters and boats to alert beach officials when there are sharks in the area. In addition, there is an array of products that claim to offer personal protection from sharks, ranging from wetsuits in different colors to devices that broadcast electrical signals in an attempt to confuse the sharks’ sensory organs. At the end of the day, though, beaches like these remain dangerous, and swimmers must assume the risk every time they paddle out from shore.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The author of this passage has a clear topic: sharks and the relationship between humans and sharks. In order to identify the main idea of the passage, the reader must ask what the author wants to say about this topic, what the reader is meant to think or understand. The author makes sure to provide information about several different aspects of the relationship between sharks and humans, and points out that humans must respect sharks as dangerous marine animals, without sensationalizing the risk of attack. This conclusion results from looking at the various pieces of information the author includes as well as the similarities between them. The passage describes sensationalistic media, then talks about how officials and governments try to protect beaches, and ends with the observation that people must take personal responsibility. These details clarify what the author’s main idea is. Summarizing that main idea by focusing on the connection between the different details helps the reader draw a conclusion.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Readers should identify the topic of a text and pay attention to how the details about it relate to one another. A passage may discuss, for example, topic similarities, characteristics, causes, and/or effects.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Examples</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">The art of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries demonstrates several aspects of modern societal advancement. A primary example is the advent and ascendancy of technology: New technologies have developed new avenues for art making, and the globalization brought about by the Internet has both diversified the art world and brought it together simultaneously. Even as artists are able to engage in a global conversation about the categories and characteristics of art, creating a more uniform understanding, they can now express themselves in a diversity of ways for a diversity of audiences. The result has been a rapid change in how art is made and consumed.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">1.	</span>This passage is primarily concerned with</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>Art making in the twenty-first century is dependent on the use of technology in order to meet current standards.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Topic and Summary Sentences</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Identifying the main idea requires understanding the structure of a piece of writing. In a short passage of one or two paragraphs, the topic and summary sentences quickly relate what the paragraphs are about and what conclusions the author wants the reader to draw. These sentences function as bookends to a paragraph or passage, telling readers what to think and keeping the passage tied tightly together. </p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> A <span class="bold_italic">summary</span> is a very brief restatement of the most important parts of an argument or text. Building a summary begins with the most important idea in a text. A longer summary also includes supporting details. The text of a summary should be much shorter than the original.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Generally, the <span class="bold">topic sentence</span> is the first, or very near the first, sentence in a paragraph. It is a general statement that introduces the topic, clearly and specifically directing the reader to access any previous experience with that topic.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">summary sentence</span>, on the other hand, frequently&mdash;but not always!&mdash;comes at the end of a paragraph or passage, because it wraps up all the ideas presented. This sentence provides an understanding of what the author wants to say about the topic and what conclusions to draw about it. While a topic sentence acts as an introduction to a topic, allowing the reader to activate his or her own ideas and experiences, the summary statement asks the reader to accept the author’s ideas about that topic. Because of this, a summary sentence helps the reader quickly identify a piece’s main idea.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Examples</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">Altogether, Egypt is a land of tranquil monotony. The eye commonly travels either over a waste of waters, or over a green plain unbroken by elevations. The hills which inclose (<span class="italic">sic</span>) the Nile valley have level tops, and sides that are bare of trees, or shrubs, or flowers, or even mosses. The sky is generally cloudless. No fog or mist enwraps the distance in mystery; no rainstorm sweeps across the scene; no rainbow spans the empyrean; no shadows chase each other over the landscape. There is an entire absence of picturesque scenery. A single broad river, unbroken within the limits of Egypt even by a rapid, two flat strips of green plain at its side, two low lines of straight-topped hills beyond them, and a boundless open space where the river divides itself into half a dozen sluggish branches before reaching the sea, constitute Egypt, which is by nature a southern Holland&mdash;“weary, stale, flat and unprofitable.”</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">3.	</span>Which of the following best explains the general idea and focus indicated by the topic sentence?</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(A)	</span>Egypt is a boring place without much to do.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(B)	</span>The land of Egypt is undisturbed; the reader will read on to find out what makes it so dull.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(C)	</span>Egypt is a peaceful place; its people live with a sense of predictability.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(D)	</span>The land of Egypt is quiet; the reader wants to know what is missing.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>The reader is curious about how people survive in an area of worn out uniformity.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">4.	</span>Which of the following best states what the author wants the reader to understand after reading the summary sentence?</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(A)	</span>There is not much to get excited about while visiting Egypt.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(B)	</span>Egypt is a poverty-stricken wasteland.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(C)	</span>The land of Egypt is worn out from overuse.</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>Egypt is so flat and worn down it is not worth visiting.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-162" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-163"></a>Supporting Details</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Between a topic sentence and a summary sentence, the rest of a paragraph is built with <span class="bold">supporting details</span>. Supporting details come in many forms; the purpose of the passage dictates the type of details that will support the main idea. A persuasive passage may use facts and data or detail specific reasons for the author’s opinion. An informative passage will primarily use facts about the topic to support the main idea. Even a narrative passage will have supporting details&mdash;specific things the author says to develop the story and characters.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The most important aspect of supporting details is exactly what the term states: They support the main idea. Examining the various supporting details and how they work with one another will solidify how the author views a topic and what the main idea of the passage is. Supporting details are key to understanding a passage.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Identifying Supporting Details</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">How can the reader identify the most important pieces of information in a passage? Supporting details build an argument and contain the concepts upon which the main idea rests. While supporting details will help the reader determine the main idea, it is actually easier to find the most important supporting details by first understanding the main idea; the pieces that make up the main argument then become clear.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Signal words</span>&mdash;transitions and conjunctions&mdash;explain to the reader how one sentence or idea is connected to another. These words and phrases can be anywhere in a sentence, and it is important to understand what each signal word means. Signal words can add information, provide counterarguments, create organization in a passage, or draw conclusions. Some common signal words include <span class="italic">in particular</span>, <span class="italic">in addition</span>, <span class="italic">besides</span>, <span class="italic">contrastingly</span>, <span class="italic">therefore</span>, and <span class="italic">because</span>.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Examples</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">The war is inevitable&mdash;and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come! It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, “Peace! Peace!”&mdash;but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question_text1">&mdash;from “Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death” speech by Patrick Henry</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">5.	</span>In the fourth sentence of the text, the word <span class="italic">but</span> signals </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(A)	</span>an example.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(B)	</span>a consequence.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(C)	</span>an exception.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(D)	</span>a reason.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>a counterargument.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">6.	</span>What argument does the author use to support his main point?</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(A)	</span>Life in slavery is not the goal of the country.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(B)	</span>To die bravely is worthwhile.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(C)	</span>Life without freedom is intolerable.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(D)	</span>The cost of going to war is too great.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>People cannot live in peace without going to war.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Evaluating Supporting Details</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Besides using supporting details to help understand a main idea, the reader must evaluate them for relevance and inconsistency. An author selects details to help organize a passage and support its main idea. Sometimes, the author’s bias results in details left out that don’t directly support the main idea or that support an opposite idea. The reader has to be able to notice not only what the author says but also what the author leaves out.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To understand how a supporting detail relates to the main idea, the purpose of the passage should be discerned: what the author is trying to communicate and what the author wants from the reader. Every passage has a specific goal, and each paragraph in a passage is meant to support that goal. For each supporting detail, the position in the text, the signal words, and the specific content work together to alert the reader to the relationship between the supporting ideas and the main idea.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Close reading involves noticing the striking features of a text. For example, does a point made in the text appeal to the reader’s sense of justice? Does a description seem rather exaggerated or overstated? Do certain words&mdash;such as <span class="italic">agonizing</span>&mdash;seem emotive? Are rhetorical questions being used to lead the reader to a certain conclusion?</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Though the author generally includes details that support the text’s main idea, the reader must decide how those details relate to one another as well as find any gaps in the support of the author’s argument. This is particularly important in a persuasive piece of writing, when an author may allow bias to show through. Discovering the author’s bias and how the supporting details reveal that bias is also key to understanding a text.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Examples</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">In England in the ’fifties came the Crimean War, with the deep stirring of national feeling which accompanied it, and the passion of gratitude and admiration which was poured forth on Miss Florence Nightingale for her work on behalf of our wounded soldiers. It was universally felt that there was work for women, even in war&mdash;the work of cleansing, setting in order, breaking down red tape, and soothing the vast sum of human suffering which every war is bound to cause. Miss Nightingale’s work in war was work that never had been done until women came forward to do it, and her message to her countrywomen was educate yourselves, prepare, make ready; never imagine that your task can be done by instinct, without training and preparation. Painstaking study, she insisted, was just as necessary as a preparation for women’s work as for men’s work; and she bestowed the whole of the monetary gift offered her by the gratitude of the nation to form training-schools for nurses at St. Thomas’s and King’s College Hospitals.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question_text1">&mdash;from <span class="italic">Women’s Suffrage: A Short History of a Great Movement</span> by Millicent Garrett Fawcett</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">7.	</span>Which of the following best states the bias of the passage?</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(A)	</span>Society underestimates the capacity of women.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(B)	</span>Generally, women are not prepared to make substantial contributions to society.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(C)	</span>If women want power, they need to prove themselves.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(D)	</span>One strong woman cannot represent all women.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>The strength of women is their ability to take care of others.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">8.	</span>Which of the following best summarizes what the author left out of the passage?</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(A)	</span>Women can fight in wars.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(B)	</span>Other women should be recognized.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(C)	</span>Women need to stop wasting time giving speeches at conventions and start proving themselves.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(D)	</span>Without the contributions of women, society suffers.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>Women are the ones who get the important work done.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-164" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-165"></a>Drawing Conclusions</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Reading text begins with making sense of the explicit meanings of information or a narrative. Understanding occurs as the reader draws conclusions and makes logical inferences. To draw a conclusion, the reader considers the details or facts. He or she then comes to a conclusion&mdash;the next logical point in the thought sequence. For example, in a Hemingway story, an old man sits alone in a café. A young waiter says that the café is closing, but the old man continues to drink. The waiter starts closing up, and the old man signals for a refill. Based on these details, the reader might conclude that the old man has not understood the young waiter’s desire for him to leave.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> When considering a character’s motivations, the reader should ask what the character wants to achieve, what the character will get by accomplishing this, and what the character seems to value the most.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">An inference is distinguished from a conclusion drawn. An <span class="bold">inference</span> is an assumption the reader makes based on details in the text as well as his or her own knowledge. It is more of an educated guess that extends the literal meaning. Inferences begin with the given details; however, the reader uses the facts to determine additional facts. What the reader already knows informs what is being suggested by the details of decisions or situations in the text. Returning to the example of the Hemingway story, the reader might infer that the old man is lonely, enjoys being in the café, and is reluctant to leave.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">When reading fictional text, inferring character motivations is essential. The actions of the characters move the plot forward; a series of events is understood by making sense of why the characters did what they did. Hemingway includes contrasting details as the young waiter and an older waiter discuss the old man. The older waiter sympathizes with the old man; both men have no one at home and experience a sense of emptiness in life, which motivates them to seek the café.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Another aspect of understanding text is connecting it to other texts. Readers may connect the Hemingway story about the old man in the café to other Hemingway stories about individuals struggling to deal with loss and loneliness in a dignified way. They can extend their initial connections to people they know or their personal experiences. When readers read a persuasive text, they often connect the arguments made to counterarguments and opposing evidence of which they are aware. They use these connections to infer meaning.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Conclusions are drawn by thinking about how the author wants the reader to feel. A group of carefully selected facts can cause the reader to feel a certain way.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Examples</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">I believe it is difficult for those who publish their own memoirs to escape the imputation of vanity; nor is this the only disadvantage under which they labor: it is also their misfortune, that what is uncommon is rarely, if ever, believed, and what is obvious we are apt to turn from with disgust, and to charge the writer with impertinence. People generally think those memoirs only worthy to be read or remembered which abound in great or striking events, those, in short, which in a high degree excite either admiration or pity: all others they consign to contempt and oblivion. It is therefore, I confess, not a little hazardous in a private and obscure individual, and a stranger too, thus to solicit the indulgent attention of the public; especially when I own I offer here the history of neither a saint, a hero, nor a tyrant. I believe there are few events in my life, which have not happened to many: it is true the incidents of it are numerous; and, did I consider myself an European, I might say my sufferings were great: but when I compare my lot with that of most of my countrymen, I regard myself as a <span class="italic">particular favorite of Heaven</span>, and acknowledge the mercies of Providence in every occurrence of my life. If then the following narrative does not appear sufficiently interesting to engage general attention, let my motive be some excuse for its publication. I am not so foolishly vain as to expect from it either immortality or literary reputation. If it affords any satisfaction to my numerous friends, at whose request it has been written, or in the smallest degree promotes the interests of humanity, the ends for which it was undertaken will be fully attained, and every wish of my heart gratified. Let it therefore be remembered, that, in wishing to avoid censure, I do not aspire to praise. </p>

			<h2 id="calibre_link-166" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-167"></a>Understanding the Author</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Many questions on the Paragraph Comprehension section will ask for an interpretation of an author’s intentions and ideas. This requires an examination of the author’s perspective and purpose as well as the way the author uses language to communicate these things.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In every passage, an author chooses words, structures, and content with specific purpose and intent. With this in mind, the reader can begin to comprehend why an author opts for particular words and structures and how these ultimately relate to the content.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">The Author’s Purpose</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The author of a passage sets out with a specific goal in mind: to communicate a particular idea to an audience. The <span class="bold">author’s purpose</span> is determined by asking why the author wants the reader to understand the passage’s main idea. There are four basic purposes to which an author can write: narrative, expository, technical, and persuasive. Within each of these general purposes, the author may direct the audience to take a clear action or respond in a certain way.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The purpose for which an author writes a passage is also connected to the structure of that text. In a <span class="bold">narrative</span>, the author seeks to tell a story, often to illustrate a theme or idea the reader needs to consider. In a narrative, the author uses characteristics of storytelling, such as chronological order, characters, and a defined setting, and these characteristics communicate the author’s theme or main idea.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In an <span class="bold">expository</span> passage, on the other hand, the author simply seeks to explain an idea or topic to the reader. The main idea will probably be a factual statement or a direct assertion of a broadly held opinion. Expository writing can come in many forms, but one essential feature is a fair and balanced representation of a topic. The author may explore one detailed aspect or a broad range of characteristics, but he or she mainly seeks to prompt a decision from the reader.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Similarly, in <span class="bold">technical</span> writing, the author’s purpose is to explain specific processes, techniques, or equipment in order for the reader to use that process or equipment to obtain a desired result. Writing like this employs chronological or spatial structures, specialized vocabulary, and imperative or directive language.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In <span class="bold">persuasive</span> writing, though the reader is free to make decisions about the message and content, the author actively seeks to convince him or her to accept an opinion or belief. Much like expository writing, persuasive writing is presented in many organizational forms, but the author will use specific techniques, or <span class="bold">rhetorical strategies</span>, to build an argument. Readers can identify these strategies in order to clearly understand what an author wants them to believe, how the author’s perspective and purpose may lead to bias, and whether the passage includes any logical fallacies.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Reading persuasive text requires an awareness of what the author believes about the topic.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Common rhetorical strategies include the appeals to ethos, logos, and pathos. An author uses these to build trust with the reader, explain the logical points of his or her argument, and convince the reader that his or her opinion is the best option. </p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">An <span class="bold">ethos&mdash;ethical&mdash;appeal</span> uses balanced, fair language and seeks to build a trusting relationship between the author and the reader. An author might explain his or her credentials, include the reader in an argument, or offer concessions to an opposing argument.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">logos&mdash;logical&mdash;appeal</span> builds on that trust by providing facts and support for the author’s opinion, explaining the argument with clear connections and reasoning. At this point, the reader should beware of logical fallacies that connect unconnected ideas and build arguments on incorrect premises. With a logical appeal, an author strives to convince the reader to accept an opinion or belief by demonstrating that not only is it the most logical option but it also satisfies his or her emotional reaction to a topic.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">pathos&mdash;emotional&mdash;appeal</span> does not depend on reasonable connections between ideas; rather, it seeks to remind the reader, through imagery, strong language, and personal connections, that the author’s argument aligns with his or her best interests. </p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Readers should consider how different audiences will react to a text. For example, how a slave owner’s reactions to the narrative of Olaudah Equiano (on page 89) will differ from a slave trader’s.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Many persuasive passages seek to use all three rhetorical strategies to best appeal to the reader.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Clues will help the reader determine many things about a passage, from the author’s purpose to the passage’s main idea, but understanding an author’s purpose is essential to fully understanding the text.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">The Audience</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The structure, purpose, main idea, and language of a text all converge on one target: the intended audience. An author makes decisions about every aspect of a piece of writing based on that audience, and readers can evaluate the writing through the lens of that audience. By considering the probable reactions of an intended audience, readers can determine many things: whether or not they are part of that intended audience; the author’s purpose for using specific techniques or devices; the biases of the author and how they appear in the writing; and how the author uses rhetorical strategies. While readers evaluate each of these things separately, identifying and considering the intended audience adds depth to the understanding of a text and helps highlight details with more clarity.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> When reading a persuasive text, students should maintain awareness of what the author believes about the topic.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Several aspects identify the text’s intended audience. First, when the main idea of the passage is known, the reader considers who most likely cares about that idea, benefits from it, or needs to know about it. Many authors begin with the main idea and then determine the audience in part based on these concerns.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Then the reader considers language. The author tailors language to appeal to the intended audience, so the reader can narrow down a broad understanding of that audience. The figurative language John Steinbeck uses in his novel <span class="italic">The Grapes of Wrath</span> reveals the suffering of the migrant Americans who traveled to California to find work during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Steinbeck spoke concretely to the Americans who were discriminating against the migrants. Instead of finding work in the “land of milk and honey,” migrants faced unbearable poverty and injustice. The metaphor that gives the novel its title is “and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.” Steinbeck used the image of ripening grapes, familiar to those surrounded by vineyards, to condemn this harsh treatment, provide an education of the human heart, and inspire compassion in his audience. Readers who weren’t directly involved in the exodus of people from Oklahoma to the West, could have little difficulty grasping the meaning of Steinbeck’s language in the description: “66 is the path of a people in flight, refugees from dust and shrinking land, from the thunder of tractors and invasion, from the twisting winds that howl up out of Texas, from floods that bring no richness to the land and steal what little richness is there.”</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_directions"><span class="italic">In the following text, consideration should be made for how an English political leader of 1729 might have reacted.</span></p>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads and cabin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in strolling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbados.</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_directions">I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">I do therefore humbly offer it to public consideration, that of the hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Tone and Mood</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Two important aspects of the communication between author and audience occur subtly. The <span class="bold">tone</span> of a passage describes the author’s attitude toward the topic, distinct from the <span class="bold">mood</span>, which is the pervasive feeling or atmosphere in a passage that provokes specific emotions in the reader. The distinction between these two aspects lies once again in the audience: the mood influences the reader’s emotional state in response to the piece, while the tone establishes a relationship between the audience and the author. Does the author intend to instruct the audience? Is the author more experienced than the audience, or does he or she wish to convey a friendly or equal relationship? In each of these cases, the author uses a different tone to reflect the desired level of communication.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> To determine the author’s tone, students should examine what overall feeling they are experiencing.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Diction</span>, or word choice, primarily determines mood and tone in a passage. Many readers make the mistake of thinking about the ideas an author puts forth and using those alone to determine particularly tone; a much better practice is to separate specific words from the text and look for patterns in connotation and emotion. By considering categories of words used by the author, the reader can discover both the overall emotional atmosphere of a text and the attitude of the author toward the subject.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Every word has not only a literal meaning but also a <span class="bold">connotative meaning</span>, relying on the common emotions, associations, and experiences an audience might associate with that word. The following words are all synonyms: <span class="italic">dog</span>, <span class="italic">puppy</span>, <span class="italic">cur</span>, <span class="italic">mutt</span>, <span class="italic">canine</span>, <span class="italic">pet</span>. Two of these words&mdash;<span class="italic">dog</span> and <span class="italic">canine</span>&mdash;are neutral words, without strong associations or emotions. Two others&mdash;<span class="italic">pet</span> and <span class="italic">puppy</span>&mdash;have positive associations. The last two&mdash;<span class="italic">cur</span> and <span class="italic">mutt</span>&mdash;have negative associations. A passage that uses one pair of these words versus another pair activates the positive or negative reactions of the audience.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> To decide the connotation of a word, the reader examines whether the word conveys a positive or negative association in the mind. Adjectives are often used to influence the feelings of the reader, such as in the phrase “an ambitious attempt to achieve.”</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Examples</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">Day had broken cold and grey, exceedingly cold and grey, when the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail and climbed the high earth-bank, where a dim and little-travelled trail led eastward through the fat spruce timberland.&nbsp;It was a steep bank, and he paused for breath at the top, excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch.&nbsp;It was nine o’clock.&nbsp;There was no sun nor hint of sun, though there was not a cloud in the sky.&nbsp;It was a clear day, and yet there seemed an intangible <span class="italic">pall</span> over the face of things, a subtle gloom that made the day dark, and that was due to the absence of sun.&nbsp;This fact did not worry the man.&nbsp;He was used to the lack of sun.&nbsp;It had been days since he had seen the sun, and he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb, due south, would just peep above the sky-line and dip immediately from view.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Vocabulary-in-context questions ask about the meaning of specific words in the passage. The questions will ask which answer choice is most similar in meaning to the specified word, or which answer choice could be substituted for that word in the passage.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">When a reader is confronted with unfamiliar words, the passage itself can help clarify their meaning. Often, identifying the tone or main idea of the passage can help eliminate answer choices. For example, if the tone of the passage is generally positive, try eliminating the answer choices with a negative connotation. Or, if the passage is about a particular occupation, rule out words unrelated to that topic. </p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Passages may also provide specific context clues that can help determine the meaning of a word. </p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">One type of context clue is a <span class="bold">definition</span>, or <span class="bold">description</span>, <span class="bold">clue</span>. Sometimes, authors use a difficult word, then include <span class="italic">that is</span> or <span class="italic">which is</span> to signal that they are providing a definition. An author also may provide a synonym or restate the idea in more familiar words:</p>
			<p class="body_text_example">Teachers often prefer teaching students with intrinsic motivation; these students have an internal desire to learn.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The meaning of <span class="italic">intrinsic</span> is restated as an <span class="italic">internal desire</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Similarly, authors may include an <span class="bold">example clue</span>, providing an example phrase that clarifies the meaning of the word:</p>
			<p class="body_text_example">Teachers may view extrinsic rewards as efficacious; however, an individual student may not be interested in what the teacher offers. For example, a student who is diabetic may not feel any incentive to work when offered a sweet treat.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="italic">Efficacious</span> is explained with an example that demonstrates how an extrinsic reward may not be effective.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Another commonly used context clue is the <span class="bold">contrast</span>, or <span class="bold">antonym</span>, <span class="bold">clue</span>. In this case, authors indicate that the unfamiliar word is the opposite of a familiar word:</p>
			<p class="body_text_example">In contrast to intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation is contingent on teachers offering rewards that are appealing.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The phrase “in contrast” tells the reader that <span class="italic">extrinsic</span> is the opposite of <span class="italic">intrinsic</span>.</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(E) is correct.</span> The argument or claim that the country should be at peace precedes the word <span class="italic">but</span>. <span class="italic">But</span> counters the demand for peace with the argument that there is no peace; the war has begun.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">6.	</span>(A) is incorrect. The main point is that the country has to go to war with England to be free. The author does not support his point with a discussion of the goals of the country.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. This does not relate to the main point of going to war.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(C) is correct.</span> The author indicates that life is not so dear, nor peace so sweet, “as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. This is inaccurate. The author insists that the cost of not fighting for freedom is too great.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. Those who opposed going to war believed that Americans could find a way to live peacefully, without a war; the author’s main point is the opposite.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">7.	</span><span class="bold">(A) is correct.</span> The author is suggesting that the work Florence Nightingale did had not been done before women came forward. Up till that point, what a woman could do had not been recognized.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. This fact may have been true at the time this text was written, but only because educational opportunities were not available to women, and women were not encouraged to develop their abilities. Including this fact reveals the bias that women should be granted opportunities to train and to contribute.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. This option does not apply; Florence Nightingale did more than prove herself.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The fact that Florence Nightingale donated the money awarded her to the training of women indicates that other women were preparing themselves to contribute.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. This may or may not be true. It does not matter what kind of strength women have; the bias is that the strength of women wasn’t really known.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">8.	</span>(A) is incorrect. “It was universally felt that there was work for women, even in war” suggests that women had much to offer and didn’t need to be sheltered; however, “there was work” does not mean the author thought women should engage in combat.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. Since the passage is specifically about Florence Nightingale, nothing in it suggests the author included information about what other women did.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. Information about women’s suffrage conventions is unrelated to the topic of the paragraph.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(D) is correct.</span> The author emphasizes that “Miss Nightingale’s work in war was work that never had been done until women came forward to do it.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The author shows the importance of Miss Nightingale’s work, but that does not suggest it was the only important work being done.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">9.	</span>(A) is incorrect. That motive is how the passage begins, but it is not his primary motive.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. He says he does not aspire to praise, and he does not suggest that he was courageous.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. He does state that the “mercies of Providence” were always with him; however, that acknowledgement is not his primary motive.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. Although he says that he wrote it at the request of friends, the story is meant to improve humanity.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(E) is correct.</span> In the passage “If it…in the smallest degree promotes the interests of humanity, the ends for which it was undertaken will be fully attained, and every wish of my heart gratified,” the narrator’s use of the word <span class="italic">humanity</span> could mean he wants to improve the human condition or he wants to increase human benevolence, or brotherly love.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">10.	</span>(A) is incorrect. The narrator says that what is obvious in his story is what people “are apt to turn from with disgust, and to charge the writer with impertinence.” The narrator is telling a story that his audience couldn’t disagree with and might consider rude.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(B) is correct.</span> By saying “what is uncommon is rarely, if ever, believed, and what is obvious we are apt to turn from with disgust,” the narrator suggests that his experience wasn’t common or ordinary and could cause disgust.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The reader can infer that the experience was horrific; it will inspire disgust, not excitement.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The narrator admits he suffered; he indicates that he narrowly escaped death. This is not an inference.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. By saying “If then the following narrative does not appear sufficiently interesting to engage general attention, let my motive be some excuse for its publication,” the narrator makes clear that he does not think his narrative is interesting, but he believes his motive to help humanity makes it worthy of publication.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">11.	</span>(A) is incorrect. The injustice of slavery in America is made clear, but only to convince the audience that slavery cannot exist in America.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. The author briefly mentions the narrative of America in terms of affirming the equal rights of all people, but he does not tell a story or relate the events that led to slavery.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The author does not describe the conditions of slaves or the many ways their human rights are denied.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(D) is correct.</span> The author provides logical reasons and evidence that slavery is wrong, that it violates the American belief in equal rights.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. Although the author begins with a short definition of evident truth, he is simply laying the foundation for his persuasive argument that slavery violates the evident truth Americans believe.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">12.	</span>(A) is incorrect. The author mentions the ant’s willingness to defend what is his but does not make an explicit and corresponding conclusion about the slave; instead, he says, “So plain, that the most dumb and stupid slave that ever toiled for a master, does constantly <span class="italic">know</span> that he is wronged.” The implied parallel is between the ant’s conviction about being wronged and the slave knowing he is wronged.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(B) is correct.</span> The author uses logic when he points out that people who claim slavery is good never wish “to take the good of it, <span class="italic">by being a slave</span>.” The author also points out that the principle of our country is to give everyone, including the “ignorant,” opportunity; then he challenges his listeners to look at the fruit of this principle, saying, “Look at it, in its aggregate grandeur, of extent of country, and numbers of population, of ship, and steamboat.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The author relies on logic and evidence, and makes no emotional appeals about the suffering of slaves.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The author does offer evidence of his point with an image of the grandeur of America, but his primary appeal is logic.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. Initially, the author uses hyperbole when he says, “Evident truth. Made so plain by our good Father in Heaven, that all <span class="italic">feel</span> and <span class="italic">understand</span> it, even down to brutes and creeping insects.” However, the author’s primary appeal is logos.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">13.	</span>(A) is incorrect. This is a fact alluded to in the passage, not a central idea.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. Although the author does refer to the Irish as savages, the reader recognizes that the author is being outrageously satirical.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The author does say “That the remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune, through the kingdom,” referring to the English. However, this is not the central idea; the opposite is, given that this is satire.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The author does mention children growing up to be thieves, but this is not the central idea.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(E) is correct.</span> The author is hoping to use satire to shame England.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">14.	</span>(A) is incorrect. The author’s subject is the poverty of the Irish, and his audience is the English who are responsible for the suffering of the Irish.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(B) is correct.</span> The intended meaning of a satire sharply contradicts the literal meaning. Swift’s proposal is not humble; it is meant to humble the arrogant. He expects the audience to be horrified. The children would make the worst imaginable food.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The author is not serious. His intent is to shock his English audience.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The author is expressing sympathy for the Irish.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. It is the Irish people who are struggling.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">15.	</span>(A) is incorrect. The man is on some adventure as he turns off the main trail, but the context is one of gloom and darkness, not excitement.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. The cold, dark day is fierce, and the man may be determined; however, the overall mood of the entire passage is one of grim danger.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(C) is correct.</span> The man is oblivious to the gloom and darkness of the day, which was “exceedingly cold and grey.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The atmosphere is grim, and there is no indication the man is hopeful about anything. He is aware only of his breath and steps forward.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The cold, grey scene of a lone man walking off the trail is intense, but “this fact did not worry the man.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">16.	</span><span class="bold">(A) is correct.</span> Within the context of the sentence “It was a clear day, and yet there seemed an intangible <span class="italic">pall</span> over the face of things, a subtle gloom that made the day dark,” the words <span class="italic">gloom</span> and <span class="italic">dark</span> are suggestive of death; the words <span class="italic">over the face</span> suggest a covering.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. The word <span class="italic">intangible</span> can mean a vague sense, but there is nothing especially familiar about a clear day that is dark, with no sunlight.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The word <span class="italic">intangible</span> suggests intimation; however, from the beginning, the author shows the man alone, and reports, “the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. A struggle may be indicated by the darkness and gloom, but the man has no understanding of this possibility. The text refers to the darkness, saying, “This fact did not worry the man.&nbsp;He was used to the lack of sun.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The man is hiking this trail for some possibility, but he is not refreshed; he is pausing to catch his “breath at the top, excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">17.	</span><span class="bold">(A) is correct.</span> The word <span class="italic">incentivize</span> is defined immediately with the synonym <span class="italic">motivate</span>, or <span class="italic">encourage</span>.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. <span class="italic">Determine</span> is not a synonym for <span class="italic">motivate</span>. In addition, the phrase “to determine learning” does not make sense in the sentence.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. <span class="italic">Challenge</span> is not a synonym for motivate.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. <span class="italic">Improve</span> is closely related to motivation, but it is not the best synonym provided.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. <span class="italic">Dissuade</span> is an antonym for motivate.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">18.	</span>(A) is incorrect. Nothing in the sentence suggests the student is uncertain.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. <span class="italic">Distracted</span> is related to the clue “focus” but does not address the clue “pressure to perform.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(C) is correct.</span> The reader can infer that the pressure to perform is making the student anxious.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. Nothing in the sentence suggests the student is forgetful.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The clues describe the student as feeling pressured but do not suggest the student is resentful.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Situational Judgment test evaluates the judgment and decision-making ability of candidates dealing with interpersonal situations. Candidates are presented with fifty multiple-choice questions to answer in thirty-five minutes. Each question presents a scenario that junior officers are likely to encounter in their careers. The scenario will be followed by five possible actions that could be taken in response. Candidates will need to pick the MOST effective and LEAST effective course of action to resolve the situation.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The candidates’ responses to the questions on this test are not judged as right or wrong; rather, the responses provide the officer recruitment board with an idea of how candidates value the significance of communication, integrity, and resource management, and how they exercise leadership characteristics. There is no minimum passing score for this test. The score is a self-composite score and is not combined with any other AFOQT subtest.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Candidates cannot study and memorize answers for this test. To answer questions correctly, they must understand how military personnel demonstrate leadership qualities, enforce established standards, and produce results. While candidates will have to rely on their own personal values and experiences, there are some general strategies that can help in choosing the most effective answer. Consider the following guidelines:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">Do not ignore a situation, confront it.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">Attempt to solve situations at the appropriate level; do not escalate situations to superior officers.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">Deal directly with those involved in a situation&mdash;do not involve supervisors, subordinates, or peers unless absolutely necessary. In situations involving lower enlisted members, always consult the member’s first noncommissioned officer in the chain of command.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">If the situation involves classified information, ensure that it is secured in accordance with appropriate regulations and guidelines.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">Do not spread details of the situation to others during casual conversation.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">Counsel the individual(s) in a private setting, not in front of peers or other junior officers.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Examples</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions"><span class="bold">Situation I.</span> As a new first lieutenant in a flight, you notice that the technical sergeant consistently relies on one airman to complete tasks. It is obvious that this airman is very energetic and gets quick results. There are a total of three airmen of the same rank and experience, and the other two either act busy on their computers or say they have personal appointments. You have noticed this many times during the past month. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">Possible actions:</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(A)	</span>Meet with the master sergeant, supervisor of the technical sergeant, and discuss what you observed.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(B)	</span>Talk to the technical sergeant, explaining what you have noticed. Do this to understand why only one airman gets all the work.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(C)	</span>As officer of the flight, direct all tasks yourself to show the technical sergeant how to delegate work.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(D)	</span>Talk with the other flight leaders in the unit and see if they have the same problem.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>Do nothing, stay away from the technical sergeant’s responsibilities.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">1.		</span>Select the MOST EFFECTIVE action (A &ndash; E) in response to the situation.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">2.		</span>Select the LEAST EFFECTIVE action (A &ndash; E) in response to the situation.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions_space"><span class="bold">Situation II.</span> In performance of your administrative duties, you send numerous daily emails. You are working on a special project with close-hold information. In a rush to leave your office to meet with the commander, you realize you emailed pertinent information about this project to someone not involved with the special project. No classified information was included in the email.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">Possible actions:</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(A)	</span>Leave the office so you are not late to the meeting with the commander.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(B)	</span>During your meeting with the commander, explain your mistake and ask for his or her directive.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(C)	</span>Direct your master sergeant or senior enlisted member to email the unintended recipient so you can make the commander meeting.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(D)	</span>Immediately call or email the unintended recipient, stating that the email was sent in error and tell him or her to delete it before opening.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>Send the email to the correct recipient. No further action is necessary since no classified information was transmitted.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">1.		</span>Select the MOST EFFECTIVE action (A &ndash; E) in response to the situation.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">2.		</span>Select the LEAST EFFECTIVE action (A &ndash; E) in response to the situation.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions_space"><span class="bold">Situation III.</span> As a maintenance officer, you are responsible for maintaining the operational readiness of six airplanes. An upcoming training mission is scheduled in three days that will require all six airplanes. Currently, only five airplanes are fully operational. The sixth airplane is partially mission capable (meaning it needs maintenance of some type, but the limited capability may or may not affect the requirement of the training mission). The pending maintenance tasks to make the sixth airplane fully mission capable would typically require twelve hours of maintenance time. The technical sergeant informed you yesterday that the maintainers were scheduled to have the next two days off prior to the mission.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_directions">Possible actions:</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(A)	</span>Inform the commander that the sixth aircraft will not be ready for the mission.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(B)	</span>Meet with the maintainers and tell them they have to work until the aircraft is mission capable.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(C)	</span>Since the aircraft is partially mission capable, direct that the aircraft is flown at the current readiness level in the upcoming mission.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(D)	</span>Meet with the master sergeant and maintainers to determine how to meet the mission requirements.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>Devise a plan of action to schedule the maintenance (personnel, time, and equipment) and meet with the master sergeant to direct that the aircraft be fixed in time for the mission.</p>

			<h2 id="calibre_link-175" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-176"></a>Answer Key</h2>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading_no_space">Situation I</h3>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(A)	Discussing the issue with the technical sergeant’s supervisor before talking with the technical sergeant him- or herself escalates the problem before you understand the reasoning behind the situation. Also, by escalating the issue, you pass the problem to another person before attempting to address it yourself.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(B)	Discussing the issue with the technical sergeant directly is the <span class="bold">most effective</span> course of action. This identifies what you perceive as a problem and allows the technical sergeant to address the reasoning behind his or her decisions. As a new officer to the flight, you are establishing a work ethic standard to spread down to the airman level.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(C)	By assigning all tasks to the airmen directly, you are overstepping your boundaries and undermining the leadership of the technical sergeant before understanding the problem. The airmen may notice your style of leadership and lose respect for both you and the technical sergeant.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(D)	Discussing the issues with other flight leaders may cause rumors to spread throughout the squadron, which can lead to a decrease in unit morale.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(E)	If you do nothing to understand and correct the perceived issue, it will not improve and will likely continue to cause friction between you and the leadership of the flight. This is the <span class="bold">least effective</span> course of action.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Situation II</h3>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(A)	Since the information on the special project is close hold (although not classified), time is of the essence to correct the problem. It is better to be late for the meeting and to explain to the commander that you had a time-sensitive issue to attend to.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(B)	There are two reasons why this is the <span class="bold">least effective</span> solution. One&mdash;there is no need to escalate the issue without trying to correct the wrongdoing. The commander is not the right person to resolve this seemingly minimal situation. Two&mdash;you should correct the problem before leaving to attend the meeting. The worst thing that could happen is that the commander will instruct you not to be late again.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(C)	If the master sergeant or other senior enlisted member is available and you explained briefly what happened, this would be a satisfactory course of action. You will save time when you delegate the task to a responsible individual in the office who understands the importance of document and information control, and you can make the meeting with the commander on time.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(D)	By correcting the situation yourself, you are not burdening anyone else with the responsibility to correct your problem. You save time that would be required to explain to another individual what happened and how you want it r<a id="calibre_link-177"></a>esolved. If a senior enlisted member is available, it could be delegated easily (answer C), but this is the <span class="bold">most effective</span> response.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(E)	Although the correct recipient will receive the email, you do not correct the problem, which is that an unintended individual received the email. Even though the project was not classified, it was close hold, meaning only a select few individuals should have received information about it.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Situation III</h3>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(A)	This situation needs to be resolved at the flight level, not escalated to the commander level. Arbitrarily removing an aircraft from a mission may be detrimental to the success of the mission. Taskings for a specific number of aircraft are identified for a reason.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(B)	This action oversteps the senior enlisted leadership of the flight by not discussing the situation with the enlisted leadership before directing the maintainers’ schedule. Quite often the senior enlisted leadership has more insight to individual personnel issues than the officers and must be informed of any changes before the lower enlisted.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(C)	Junior maintenance officers will not have the authority to approve this option. Mission readiness of aircraft may also involve the safety of other personnel, in which case, commanders will retain authority for such a decision. This is the <span class="bold">least effective</span> selection due to safety concerns.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(D)	For resource management (personnel, time, and equipment), the lower-ranking personnel will not be involved in the decision-making process.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answers">(E)	This is the <span class="bold">most effective</span> solution. Explaining the situation and requirements to the flight senior enlisted leadership emphasizes the importance of sacrifice for military personnel. During this meeting, the two of you can agree on your plan of action, and the enlisted leadership can provide insight on any unforeseen circumstances that may preclude mission accomplishment.</p>

			<h1 id="calibre_link-179" class="chapter_title"><a id="calibre_link-180" class="calibre3"></a>SEVEN: Self-Description Inventory</h1>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Self-Description Inventory (SDI) is a well-known personality assessment used by the US military as a means of personnel selection. A personality test is a standardized, scientific instrument intended to reveal an individual’s characteristics or mental and emotional construct. (Note that the terms <span class="italic">instrument</span>, <span class="italic">survey</span>, <span class="italic">assessment</span>, and <span class="italic">inventory</span> have the same meaning and are used interchangeably.) The SDI is a 220-item computerized or paper-and-pencil-formatted test with a time limit of forty minutes.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">This test aims to measure five personality traits known as the “Big Five”: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. In broad terms, each attribute determines typical features of personality. For example, an extrovert (having the quality of extraversion) is commonly labeled as being affable, confident, talkative, and outgoing. Agreeableness is generally connected with being approachable, empathetic, cooperative, and easygoing. Conscientiousness is linked with being success-driven, methodical, reliable, accountable, and diligent. Traits that characterize neuroticism include anxiety, hopelessness, and irritability. Lastly, individuals who score high on openness tend to be interested in scientific activities, and are intellectually inquisitive and thoughtful.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">It is important to work quickly but to answer all statements thoroughly. Do not waste time deciding what your response ought to be. There are no right or wrong answers or high/low scores to calculate. Give your first impression of how closely each statement represents you from the scale ranging from <span class="italic">Strongly Agree</span> to <span class="italic">Strongly Disagree</span>. If you strongly agree with a statement, choose A on the scale; if you strongly disagree with a statement, choose E. If your response is somewhere in between, choose B, C, or D (Agree, Neutral, Disagree). Ultimately, your responses are compared with others in your age and sex category.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading_no_space">Atoms and Elements</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">An <span class="bold">atom</span> is the smallest particle of an element that is still identifiable as a part of that element; if you break down an atom any further, it is no longer an identifiable element.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">An atom is made up of several subatomic particles. The three most important are <span class="bold">protons</span>; which have a positive charge; <span class="bold">electrons</span>, which have a negative charge; and <span class="bold">neutrons</span>, which are neutral. The protons and neutrons of an atom are located at its center in the nucleus; the electrons move in orbitals around the nucleus. Protons and neutrons both have mass that is measured in atomic mass units (amu); the mass of an electron is so negligible that it is usually not considered.<a id="calibre_link-186"></a></p>

			</div>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Electrons orbit the nucleus in increasing energy levels called <span class="bold">shells</span>. Only the electrons in the outermost, or <span class="bold">valence</span>, shell are involved in chemical reactions. Atoms that are close to having a completely full or empty shell will be the most reactive and will easily give electrons (if the shell is almost empty) or receive electrons (if the shell is almost full). Atoms with full valence shells, which include the noble gases, are nonreactive. The space taken up by orbiting electrons is large relative to the size of the nucleus. Thus, the nucleus is only a small portion of the total amount of space an atom takes up, even though it contains most of an atom’s mass.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">All atoms of the same <span class="bold">element</span> have the same number of protons (called that element’s <span class="bold">atomic number</span>). For example, all carbon atoms have six protons. There are approximately 109 known elements; eighty-eight of these occur naturally on the earth, while the others are synthesized (manufactured). The elements are grouped together on the periodic table, and each has its own one- or two-letter symbol.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">Periodic Table of Elements</span> is a chart that arranges the chemical elements in an easy-to-understand way. Each element is listed in order of increasing atomic number and aligned so that the elements exhibit similar qualities. Each row in the table is known as a period, and each column is called a group.</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Elements in the periodic table exhibit trends across periods and groups:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">Elements within a group have the same outer electron arrangement. The number of the main group corresponds to the number of valence electrons in those elements; however, most of the transition elements contain two electrons in their valence shells.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The horizontal rows correspond to the number of occupied electron shells of the atom.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The elements set below the main table are the lanthanides (upper row) and actinides. They also usually have two electrons in their outer shells.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">In general, the elements increase in mass from left to right and from top to bottom.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">While all atoms in an element have the same number of protons, they can have different numbers of neutrons and electrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called <span class="bold">isotopes</span> and can have different masses. Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of electrons are called <span class="bold">ions</span> and will have a charge. Positive ions are called cations, and negative ions are called anions. If an atom has the same number of protons and electrons, it is neutral.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">When two or more atoms join together they form a <span class="bold">molecule</span>. For example, O<span class="sub">3</span> (ozone) contains three oxygen atoms bound together, and H<span class="sub">2</span>O (water) contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen. Water is considered a <span class="bold">compound</span> because it is made by combining two or more different elements. Atoms can be joined together by different types of bonds. In a <span class="bold">covalent bond</span>, the atoms share electrons. In an <span class="bold">ionic bond</span>, two ions with opposite charges are attracted to each other and bind together. Chemical formulas are used to represent the atomic composition of a molecule. For example, one molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms (H) and one oxygen atom (O), so its chemical formula is H<span class="sub">2</span>O.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Compounds and Mixtures</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Substances that contain more than one type of element are called <span class="bold">compounds</span> (so, a molecule that contains more than one element is also a compound). Compounds made up of identical molecules are called pure substances. Water, for example, is a pure substance made up only of identical water molecules.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">mixture</span> consists of two or more substances that are not chemically bonded. Mixtures are generally placed in one of two categories. The components in a <span class="bold">homogeneous mixture</span> are uniformly distributed; examples include salt water and air. In a <span class="bold">heterogeneous mixture</span>, the components are not uniformly distributed. Vegetable soup, for example, is heterogeneous, as are rocks and soil.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A uniform, or homogeneous, mixture of different molecules is called a <span class="bold">solution</span>. If the solution is a liquid, the material being dissolved is the <span class="bold">solute</span>, and the liquid it is being dissolved in is called the <span class="bold">solvent</span>. Both solids and gases can dissolve in liquids. A <span class="bold">saturated solution</span> has reached a point of maximum concentration; no more solute will dissolve in it.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">States of Matter</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The physical states of matter are generally grouped into three main <span class="bold">states</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Solids</span> are rigid; they maintain their shape and have strong intermolecular forces. In solids, the molecules are closely packed together, and solid materials usually have a high density. In the majority of solids, called crystalline solids, the ions or molecules are packed into a crystal structure that is highly ordered.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Liquids</span> cannot maintain their own shape; they conform to their containers but contain forces strong enough to keep molecules from dispersing into spaces. <span class="bold">Gases</span> have indefinite shape; they disperse rapidly through space due to random movement of particles and are able to occupy any volume. They are held together by weak forces.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Two other states of matter include <span class="bold">liquid crystals</span>, which can maintain their shape as well as be made to flow, and <span class="bold">plasmas</span>, gases in which electrons have been stripped from their nuclei.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Changes in temperature and pressure can cause matter to change states. Generally, adding energy (in the form of heat) changes a substance to a higher energy state (e.g., solid to liquid). Transitions from a high to lower energy state (e.g., liquid to solid) release energy. Each of these changes has a specific name:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">solid to liquid: melting</li>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Chemical Reactions</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">A <span class="bold">chemical reaction</span> occurs when there is a conversion of one set of chemical substances to another set. Chemical reactions are caused primarily by a change in bonding structure in these substances due to the exchange of electrons.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In a chemical reaction, the starting substances are called the <span class="bold">reagents</span> or <span class="bold">reactants</span>, and the ending substances are called the <span class="bold">products</span>. In the reaction below, the reactants sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and iron sulfate (FeSO<span class="sub">4</span>) react to form the products sodium sulfate (Na<span class="sub">2</span>SO<span class="sub">4</span>) and iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)<span class="sub">2</span>). Note the <span class="bold">coefficient</span> of 2 in front of the sodium hydroxide reactant: for every one mole of the other reactants and products, the reaction requires two moles of sodium hydroxide.</p>
			<p class="body_text_example">2NaOH + FeSO<span class="sub">4</span> <span class="arial">→</span> Na<span class="sub">2</span>SO<span class="sub">4</span> + Fe(OH)<span class="sub">2</span></p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">This reaction is known as a <span class="bold">double displacement reaction</span> because the ions in each reagent are displaced and trade places to form two new products. In a <span class="bold">single displacement reaction</span>, a lone atom or molecule displaces an ion in the second reagent, creating two new products, as shown below:</p>
			<p class="body_text_example">MgCl<span class="sub">2</span> + 2Na <span class="arial">→</span> Mg + 2NaCl</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In a <span class="bold">synthesis reaction</span>, two compounds combine to form a single product:</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The opposite reaction, when a single reactant breaks down into two or more products, is called a <span class="bold">decomposition reaction</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Finally, a <span class="bold">combustion reaction</span> occurs when oxygen is reacted in the presence of heat to a combustible compound, usually an organic compound. The products of a combustion reaction are always water and carbon dioxide. For example, the reaction of methane with oxygen will proceed as follows:</p>
			<p class="body_text_example">CH<span class="sub">4</span> + 2O<span class="sub">2</span> <span class="arial">→</span> CO<span class="sub">2</span> + 2H<span class="sub">2</span>O</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In <span class="bold">oxidation/reduction reactions</span> (also called redox reactions), electrons are transferred between atoms. In a redox reaction, the total number of electrons shared by the reactants does not change&mdash;they are simply shifted around. An element is <span class="bold">oxidized</span> when it loses its electrons, and the element that gains those electrons is now <span class="bold">reduced</span>. Therefore, the element that does the oxidizing is known as the <span class="bold">reducing agent</span> because it has given electrons, or has reduced, a different element in the reaction. The same thing happens with the reduced element. It is called the <span class="bold">oxidizing agent</span> because it has taken electrons from a different element. In the reaction below, copper is reduced and silver is oxidized.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Properties of Matter</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="bold">Matter</span> is commonly defined as anything that takes up space and has mass. <span class="bold">Mass</span> is the quantity of matter something possesses (e.g., how much of something there is); it is usually measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg). In addition to mass, it is possible to measure many other properties of matter, including weight, volume, density, and reactivity. These properties fall into one of two categories: <span class="bold">extrinsic properties</span> are directly related to the amount of material being measured (e.g., mass and volume), while <span class="bold">intrinsic properties</span> are those that are independent of the quantity of matter present (e.g., density and specific gravity).</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Matter can undergo two types of change: chemical and physical. A <span class="bold">chemical change</span> occurs when an original substance is transformed into a new substance with different properties. An example would be the burning of wood, which produces ash and smoke. Transformations that do not produce new substances, such as cutting a piece of wood or melting ice, are called <span class="bold">physical changes</span>.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Acids and Bases</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">There are a number of different technical definitions for acids and bases. In general, an <span class="bold">acid</span> can be defined as a substance that produces hydrogen ions (H<span class="super">+</span>) in solution, while a <span class="bold">base</span> produces hydroxide ions (OH<span class="super">−</span>). Acidic solutions, which include common liquids like orange juice and vinegar, share a set of distinct characteristics: they have a sour taste and react strongly with metals. Bases, such as bleach and detergents, will taste bitter and have a slippery texture.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The acidity or basicity of a solution is described using its <span class="bold">pH</span> value, which is the negative log of the concentration of hydrogen ions. A neutral solution, which has the same concentration of hydrogen and hydroxide ions, has a pH of 7. Bases have a pH between 7 and 14, and acids have a pH between 0 and 7. Note that the pH scale is exponential, so a solution with a pH of 2 has 100 times more hydrogen ions than one with a pH of 4. A <span class="bold">strong acid</span> ionizes completely in solution, meaning it releases all of its H<span class="super">+</span> ions and will have a pH close to 1.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">buffer</span> is any solution that exhibits very little change in its pH when small amounts of an acid or base are added to it. An acidic buffer solution is simply one with a pH of less than 7. Often a weak acid and one of its salts are combined to create an acidic buffer. Other times a weak base can be combined with one of its salts to create an alkaline buffer. Any solution with a pH greater than 7 would be known as an alkaline buffer solution.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading_no_space">Force and Motion</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">To study motion, it is necessary to understand the concept of scalars and vectors. <span class="bold">Scalars</span> are measurements that have a quantity but no direction. <span class="bold">Vectors</span>, in contrast, have both a quantity and a direction. <span class="bold">Distance</span> is a scalar: it describes how far an object has traveled along a path. Distance can have values such as 54 m or 16 miles. <span class="bold">Displacement</span> is a vector: it describes how far an object has traveled from its starting position. A displacement value will indicate direction, such as 54 m east or −16 miles.</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">
				<div id="calibre_link-192" class="image_below38">
					<img class="_idgenobjectattribute" src="images/00037.jpeg" alt="" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Speed</span> describes how quickly something is moving. It is found by dividing distance by time, and so it is a scalar value. <span class="bold">Velocity</span> is the rate at which an object changes position. Velocity is found by dividing displacement by time, meaning it is a vector value. An object that travels a certain distance and then returns to its starting point has a velocity of zero because its final position did not change. Its speed, however, can be found by dividing the total distance it traveled by the time it took to make the trip. <span class="bold">Acceleration</span> is how quickly an object changes velocity.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A push or pull that causes an object to move or change direction is called a <span class="bold">force</span>. Forces can arise from a number of different sources. <span class="bold">Gravity</span> is the attraction of one mass to another mass. For example, the earth’s gravitational field pulls objects toward it, and the sun’s gravitational field keeps planets in motion around it. Electrically charged objects will also create a field that will cause other charged objects in that field to move. Other forces include <span class="bold">tension</span>, which is found in ropes pulling or holding up an object; <span class="bold">friction</span>, which is created by two objects moving against each other; and the <span class="bold">normal force</span>, which occurs when an object is resting on another object. The <span class="bold">buoyant</span> force is the upward force experienced by floating objects.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> The normal force balances out gravity in resting objects. When a book rests on a table, gravity pulls down on it, and the normal force pushes up, canceling each other out and holding the book still.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">An object that is at rest or moving with a constant speed has a net force of zero, meaning all the forces acting on it cancel each other out. Such an object is said to be at <span class="bold">equilibrium</span>. Isaac Newton proposed three <span class="bold">laws of motion</span> that govern forces:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Newton’s first law</span>: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted on by a force.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Newton’s second law</span>: Force is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by its acceleration (<span class="italic">F</span> = <span class="italic">ma</span>).</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Newton’s third law</span>: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The laws of motion have made it possible to build <span class="bold">simple machines</span>, which take advantage of the rules of motion to make work easier to perform. Simple machines include the inclined plane, wheel and axle, pulley, screw, wedge, and lever.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Energy and Matter</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="bold">Energy</span> is the capacity of an object to do work. In other words, it is the capacity of an object to cause some sort of movement or change. There are two kinds of energy: kinetic and potential. <span class="bold">Kinetic energy</span> is the energy possessed by objects in motion, and <span class="bold">potential energy</span> is possessed by objects that have the potential to be in motion due to their position. Potential energy is defined in relation to a specific point. For example, a book held 10 feet off the ground has more potential energy than a book held 5 feet off the ground, because it has the potential to fall farther (i.e., to do more work).</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Like matter, energy is always conserved. It can be changed from one form to another, but it can never be created or destroyed.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Kinetic energy can be turned into potential energy, and vice versa. In the example above, dropping one of the books turns potential energy into kinetic energy. Conversely, picking up a book and placing it on a table turns kinetic energy into potential energy.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">There are several types of potential energy. The energy stored in a book placed on a table is <span class="bold">gravitational potential energy</span>; it is derived from the pull of the earth’s gravity on the book. <span class="bold">Electric potential energy</span> is derived from the interaction between positive and negative charges. Because opposite charges attract each other, and like charges repel, energy can be stored when opposite charges are moved apart or when like charges are pushed together. Similarly, compressing a spring stores <span class="bold">elastic potential energy</span>. Energy is also stored in chemical bonds as <span class="bold">chemical potential energy</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Temperature</span> is the special name given to the kinetic energy of all the atoms or molecules in a substance. While it might look like a substance is not in motion, in fact, its atoms are constantly spinning and vibrating. The more energy the atoms have, the higher the substance’s temperature. <span class="bold">Heat</span> is the movement of energy from one substance to another. Energy will spontaneously move from high-energy (high-temperature) substances to low-energy (low-temperature) substances.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">This energy can be transferred by radiation, convection, or conduction. <span class="bold">Radiation</span> does not need a medium; the sun radiates energy to the earth through the vacuum of space. <span class="bold">Conduction</span> occurs when two substances are in contact with each other. When a pan is placed on a hot stove, the heat energy is conducted from the stove to the pan and then to the food in the pan. <span class="bold">Convection</span> transfers energy through circular movement of air or liquids. For example, a convection oven transfers heat through circular movement caused by hot air rising and cold air sinking.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Waves</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Energy can also be transferred through <span class="bold">waves</span>, which are repeating pulses of energy. Waves that travel through a medium, like ripples on a pond or compressions in a Slinky, are called <span class="bold">mechanical waves</span>. Waves that vibrate up and down (like the ripples on a pond) are <span class="bold">transverse waves</span>, and those that travel through compression (like the Slinky) are <span class="bold">longitudinal waves</span>. Mechanical waves will travel faster through denser mediums; for example, sound waves will move faster through water than through air.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Waves can be described using a number of different properties. A wave’s highest point is called its <span class="bold">crest</span>, and its lowest point is the <span class="bold">trough</span>. A wave’s midline is halfway between the crest and trough; the <span class="bold">amplitude</span> describes the distance between the midline and the crest (or trough). The distance between crests (or troughs) is the <span class="bold">wavelength</span>. A wave’s <span class="bold">period</span> is the time it takes for a wave to go through one complete cycle, and the number of cycles a wave goes through in a specific period of time is its <span class="bold">frequency</span>.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Sound</span> is a special type of longitudinal wave created by vibrations. Our ears are able to interpret these waves as particular sounds. The frequency, or rate, of the vibration determines the sound’s <span class="bold">pitch</span>. <span class="bold">Loudness</span> depends on the amplitude, or height, of a sound wave.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">Doppler effect</span> is the difference in perceived pitch caused by the motion of the object creating the wave. For example, as an ambulance approaches, the siren’s pitch will appear to increase to the observer and then to decrease as the ambulance moves away. This occurs because sound waves are compressed as the ambulance approaches an observer and are spread out as the ambulance moves away from the observer.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Electromagnetic waves</span> are composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields and thus do not require a medium to travel through. The electromagnetic spectrum classifies the types of electromagnetic waves based on their frequency. These include radio waves, microwaves, X-rays, and visible light.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The study of light is called <span class="bold">optics</span>. Because visible light is a wave, it will display similar properties to other waves. It will <span class="bold">reflect</span>, or bounce off, surfaces, which can be observed by shining a flashlight on a mirror. Light will also <span class="bold">refract</span>, or bend, when it travels between substances. This effect can be seen by placing a pencil in water and observing the apparent bend in the pencil.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Curved pieces of glass called <span class="bold">lenses</span> can be used to bend light in a way that affects how an image is perceived. Some microscopes, for example, make objects appear larger through the use of specific types of lenses. Eyeglasses also use lenses to correct poor vision.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The frequency of a light wave is responsible for its <span class="bold">color</span>, with red/orange colors having a lower frequency than blue/violet colors. White light is a blend of all the frequencies of visible light. Passing white light through a prism will bend each frequency at a slightly different angle, separating the colors and creating a <span class="bold">rainbow</span>. Sunlight passing through raindrops can undergo this effect, creating large rainbows in the sky.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Electricity and Magnetism</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="bold">Electric charge</span> is created by a difference in the balance of protons and electrons, which creates a positively or negatively charged object. Charged objects create an electric field that spreads outward from the object. Other charged objects in that field will experience a force: objects that have opposite charges will be <span class="bold">attracted</span> to each other, and objects with the same charge will be <span class="bold">repelled</span>, or pushed away, from each other.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Because protons cannot leave the nucleus, charge is created by the movement of electrons. Materials that conduct electrons well are called <span class="bold">conductors</span>, and those that do not conduct electricity well are <span class="bold">insulators</span>. Static electricity, or <span class="bold">electrostatic</span> charge, occurs when a surface has a buildup of charges. For example, if a student rubs a balloon on her head, the friction will cause electrons to move from her hair to the balloon. This creates a negative charge on the balloon and a positive charge on her hair; the resulting attraction will cause her hair to move toward the balloon.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Electricity</span> is the movement of electrons through a conductor, and an electric <span class="bold">circuit</span> is a closed loop through which electricity moves. Circuits include a <span class="bold">voltage</span> source, which powers the movement of electrons known as <span class="bold">current (</span>measured in <span class="bold">Amperes</span> or <span class="bold">Amps)</span>. Sources of voltage include batteries, generators, and wall outlets (which are in turn powered by electric power stations). Other elements, such as lights, computers, and microwaves, can then be connected to the circuit to be powered by its electricity. Elements in a circuit that resist the flow of electrons are called <span class="bold">resistors</span>. Resistance is measured in Ohms (Ω). </p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Magnets</span> are created by the alignment of spinning electrons within a substance. This alignment will occur naturally in some substances, including iron, nickel, and cobalt, all of which can be used to produce <span class="bold">permanent magnets</span>. The alignment of electrons creates a <span class="bold">magnetic field</span>, which, like an electric or gravitational field, can act on other objects. Magnetic fields have a north and a south pole that act similarly to electric charges: opposite poles will attract, and same poles will repel each other. However, unlike electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, a magnetic field ALWAYS has two poles. If a magnet is cut in half, the result is two magnets, each with a north and a south pole.</p>

A specific kind of <span class="bold">temporary magnet</span> known as an electromagnet can be made by coiling a wire around a metal object and running electricity through it. A magnetic field will be created when the wire contains a current but will disappear when the flow of electricity is stopped.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Earth, the moon, and the sun interact in a number of ways that impact life on our planet. When the positions of the three align, eclipses occur. A <span class="bold">lunar eclipse</span> occurs when Earth lines up between the moon and the sun; the moon moves into the shadow of Earth and appears dark in color. A <span class="bold">solar eclipse </span>occurs when the moon lines up between Earth and the sun; the moon covers the sun, blocking sunlight.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The cycle of day and night and the seasonal cycle are determined by the earth’s motion. It takes approximately 365 days, or one year, for Earth to revolve around the sun. While Earth is revolving around the sun, it is also rotating on its axis, which takes approximately twenty-four hours, or one day. As the planet rotates, different areas alternately face toward the sun and away from the sun, creating night and day.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The earth’s axis is not directly perpendicular to its orbit, meaning the planet tilts on its axis. The seasons are caused by this tilt. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, it receives more sunlight and experiences summer. At the same time that the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer, the Southern Hemisphere, which receives less direct sunlight, experiences winter. As the earth revolves, the Northern Hemisphere will tilt away from the sun and move into winter, while the Southern Hemisphere tilts toward the sun and moves into summer.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="bold">Geology</span> is the study of the minerals and rocks that make up the earth. A <span class="bold">mineral</span> is a naturally occurring, solid, inorganic substance with a crystalline structure. There are several properties that help identify a mineral, including color, luster, hardness, and density. Examples of minerals include talc, diamonds, and topaz.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Luster describes how light reflects off the surface of a mineral. Terms to describe luster include <span class="italic">dull</span>, <span class="italic">metallic</span>, <span class="italic">pearly</span>, and <span class="italic">waxy</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Although a <span class="bold">rock</span> is also a naturally occurring solid, it can be either organic or inorganic and is composed of one or more minerals. Rocks are classified based on their method of formation. The three types of rocks are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. <span class="bold">Igneous</span> rocks are the result of tectonic processes that bring <span class="bold">magma</span>, or melted rock, to the earth’s surface; they can form either above or below the surface. <span class="bold">Sedimentary</span> rocks are formed from the compaction of rock fragments that results from weathering and erosion. Lastly, <span class="bold">metamorphic rocks</span> form when extreme temperature and pressure cause the structure of pre-existing rocks to change.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The rock cycle describes how rocks form and break down. Typically, the cooling and solidification of magma as it rises to the surface creates igneous rocks. These rocks are then subject to <span class="bold">weathering</span>, the mechanical and/or chemical processes by which rocks break down. During <span class="bold">erosion</span> the resulting sediment is deposited in a new location. As sediment is deposited, the resulting compaction creates new sedimentary rocks. As new layers are added, rocks and minerals are forced closer to the earth’s core where they are subjected to heat and pressure, resulting in metamorphic rock. Eventually, they will reach their melting point and return to magma, starting the cycle over again. This process takes place over hundreds of thousands or even millions of years.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Paleontology</span>, the study of the history of life on Earth, is sometimes also considered part of geology. Paleontologists study the <span class="bold">rock record</span>, which retains biological history through <span class="bold">fossils</span>, the preserved remains and traces of ancient life. Fossils can be used to learn about the evolution of life on the planet, particularly bacteria, plants, and animals that have gone extinct. Throughout Earth’s history, there have been five documented catastrophic events that caused major extinctions. For each mass extinction, there are several theories about the cause but no definitive answers. Theories about what triggered mass extinctions include climate change, ice ages, asteroid and comet impacts, and volcanic activity.</p>

Over 200 million years ago, the continents were joined together in one giant landmass called Pangea. Due to continental drift, or the slow movement of tectonic plates, the continents gradually shifted to their current positions.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The boundaries where plates meet are the locations for many geologic features and events. Mountains are formed when plates collide and push land upward, and trenches form when one plate is pushed beneath another.

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The humidity, or amount of water vapor in the air, and the temperature are two major atmospheric conditions that determine <span class="bold">weather</span>, the day-to-day changes in atmospheric conditions. A warm front occurs when warm air moves over a cold air mass, causing the air to feel warmer and more humid. A cold front occurs when cold air moves under a warm air mass, causing a drop in temperature.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Sometimes, weather turns violent. Tropical cyclones, or <span class="bold">hurricanes</span>, originate over warm ocean water. Hurricanes have destructive winds of more than 74 miles per hour and create large storm surges that can cause extensive damage along coastlines. Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones are all the same type of storm; they just have different names based on where the storm is located. Hurricanes originate in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific Ocean, typhoons in the Western Pacific Ocean, and cyclones in the Indian Ocean. <span class="bold">Tornadoes</span> occur when unstable warm and cold air masses collide and a rotation is created by fast-moving winds.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The long-term weather conditions in a geographic location are called <span class="bold">climate</span>. A <span class="bold">climate zone</span> is a large area that experiences similar average temperature and precipitation. The three major climate zones, based on temperature, are the polar, temperate, and tropical zones. Each climate zone is subdivided into subclimates that have unique characteristics. The tropical climate zone (warm temperatures) can be subdivided into tropical wet, tropical wet and dry, semiarid, and arid. The temperate climate zones (moderate temperatures) include Mediterranean, humid subtropical, marine West Coast, humid continental, and subarctic. The polar climate zones (cold temperatures) include tundra, highlands, nonpermanent ice, and ice cap. Polar climates are cold and experience prolonged, dark winters due to the tilt of the earth’s axis.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he questions on the Instrument Comprehension section of the AFOQT test candidates’ ability to understand basic cockpit instruments. The test includes twenty-five questions with a five-minute time limit, so questions need to be answered quickly. Each multiple-choice question will show two figures: an artificial horizon and a compass. The artificial horizon will show the attitude of the aircraft, providing information on the aircraft’s pitch and bank. The compass displays heading information. The answer choices will show four aircraft silhouettes, one of which matches the attitude and heading shown in the question.</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">
				<div id="calibre_link-217" class="image_below49">
					<img class="_idgenobjectattribute" src="images/00137.jpeg" alt="" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In the example above, the artificial horizon shows that the plane is in level flight and banking right. The compass gives the plane’s heading as west. These instrument readings correspond to plane B. Plane A is in level flight, but is banking left and heading north. Plane C is banking right, but is climbing and heading east. Finally, plane D is in level flight headed west, but is not banking.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-218" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-219"></a>Reading the Artificial Horizon</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The artificial horizon is a representation of the attitude of the aircraft, which includes the aircraft’s pitch and bank. Pitch is the nose up or down attitude of the plane in relation to the horizon, while bank (or roll) is the relationship of the line drawn from wingtip to wingtip and the horizon. The instrument display will include an aircraft in its center that remains fixed and a line representing the horizon that moves to show the relationship of the plane to the horizon. The instrument also includes an arrow that shows the aircraft’s bank.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To read the instrument, start by determining pitch, which describes the attitude of the plane’s nose relative to the horizon. If the horizon line passes through the aircraft depiction in the center of the instrument, the plane is level. If it is below, the plane is climbing, and the nose will be higher than the tail. If the horizon is above the aircraft depiction, the plane is descending and the nose will be lower than the tail. If the horizon is at an angle, reference the point in the center of the horizon line from left to right on the instrument and compare it to the aircraft depiction. The farther the horizon line is from the center of the instrument, the more the airplane is pitched.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Next, determine the bank, or relative wing level (low or high). Bank can be determined by referencing the tilt of the horizon. If the horizon is higher on the right, the plane is turning right, and the answer will show the right wing low. Conversely, if the horizon is higher on the left, the plane is turning left, and the answer will show the left wing down. The wings will be opposite the horizon. A level horizon means there is no bank, and the wings will also be level.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Remember, the wings and the horizon will be opposite. If the horizon is lower on the left, the right wing of the airplane in the answer will be lower.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The arrow shown on the artificial horizon can also be used to determine pitch. If the arrow is centered in the display, the plane is not banking. The arrow will be left of center if the plane is banking right, and right of center if the plane is banking left.</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">
				<div id="calibre_link-220" class="image_below50">
					<img class="_idgenobjectattribute" src="images/00125.jpeg" alt="" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The pitch of the airplane in the answers can be identified by referencing an imagined line between the nose and tail of the plane. If the line is level, the plane is flying straight and level. If the line is higher at the nose, the plane is climbing. If the line is lower at the nose, the plane is descending. Pitch can be a little harder to determine if the plane is oriented directly in or out of the picture, but close examination will show if the nose is higher, lower, or even with the tail.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Next, determine bank angle by looking at the relative position of the wings. One wing will be higher or lower than the other, or both wings will be even.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-221" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-222"></a>Reading the Compass</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The compass figure displays heading information. The compass display will show an arrow or a plane that points in the direction the aircraft is traveling and will include the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) and the four intercardinal directions (northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest).</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">
				<div id="calibre_link-223" class="image_below51">
					<img class="_idgenobjectattribute" src="images/00005.jpeg" alt="" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In the correct answer choice, the nose of the aircraft will point in the direction indicated by the arrow in the compass. When looking at the aircraft silhouette, candidates are always looking north. Thus a plane heading north will look like it is flying into the page, and a plane heading s<a id="calibre_link-224"></a>outh will appear to be flying out of the page. An aircraft headed east will have its nose pointed to the right, and an aircraft headed west will have its nose pointed left.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his Aviation section tests knowledge of topics related to aircraft operations, including the physics of flight, aircraft performance and structures, airfield and airspace operations, flight controls, and instrument comprehension, as well as a brief history of aviation.</p>
			<h2 id="calibre_link-233" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-234"></a>The Physics of Flight</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">A successful aircraft flight is the result of an understanding of the scientific theories and principles involved in moving 300 to 400 tons of machinery through the skies at speeds ranging from 100 to 750 miles per hour (mph). Newton’s laws of motion, Newton’s law of universal gravitation, and Bernoulli’s principle, along with weight, balance, the factors that constitute the flight envelope, and the axes of an aircraft all play a part in aeronautics.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Newton’s Laws of Motion</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Isaac Newton’s three laws of motion detail the fundamental mechanics of motion. The first law focuses on inertia, the second law defines when an accelerated motion is applied to a force, and the third law explains the relationship of motion between any two objects.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Newton’s first law of motion</span>, also called the<span class="bold"> law of inertia</span>, states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. The unbalanced force may be any force, such as gravity or friction. For example, a ball sitting on the floor will remain still unless a force is exerted upon it&mdash;a kick from a foot, a push from a hand, or a strong wind moving it.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in velocity whether the object is in motion or motionless.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">There are four types of friction:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Sliding</span>, or<span class="italic"> </span><span class="bold">kinetic, friction</span> results when the surface of one object slides along the surface of another object. This is commonly seen when pushing a solid object, such as a plate or book along a tabletop.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Fluid friction</span> is the resistance on an object when it is moved through either air (gas) or water (liquid). This is witnessed when a fish moves through water, a bird flies through air, or an airplane creates drag.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Rolling friction</span> is similar to sliding friction except rolling friction occurs when an object rolls&mdash;instead of slides&mdash;across a surface. This is observed when a bowling ball rolls down an alley. The ball, once pushed, moves at a particular rate, or velocity, while also resisting that movement due to qualities of the surface on which it is rolling.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Static friction</span> is what keeps an object at rest when that object is acted upon by an external force. A trash can initially remains in place due to static friction when an attempt is made to drag it across a floor.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">As an example of the four frictions, if a car is traveling at 40 mph, the passengers and contents inside the car are also moving at a rate of 40 mph, until the driver applies the brakes to avoid a collision with a tree. If the passengers are not restrained by seat belts, the full effects of a collision pass from the vehicle to them as well as to the contents of the vehicle. The tires of the vehicle rolling along the road overcome rolling friction. The vehicle counteracts fluid friction from any oncoming wind. When the driver applies the brakes, the wheels may stop rolling but the car skids along the surface of the road, exemplifying sliding friction. At the moment of the car’s impact with the tree, objects inside the vehicle overcome static friction as they scatter.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Newton’s second law of motion</span> states that when a body is acted upon by a constant force, its resulting acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the body and directly proportional to the applied force.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The net force of an object is equal to the product of the mass of the object and the acceleration. The equation to determine the amount of force is <span class="italic">F</span> = <span class="italic">ma</span>. One unit of force (<span class="italic">F</span>) is defined as Newtons (N). Mass is weighed in kilograms (kg) and acceleration is measured in meters per second per second (m/s/s or m/s<span class="super">2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Newton’s third law of motion</span> states that if two objects interact, the force exerted by the first object on the second object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the second object on the first object.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">For example, the force exerted by a tennis racket hitting a tennis ball is equal in magnitude and opposite the force exerted by the ball on the tennis racket. Likewise, during a launch of a rocket into space, the gases expelled under the rocket exert enough force to cause the rocket to lift off the launchpad in the opposite direction.</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">1.	</span>Consider an object acted on by only two forces, as shown below.

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Isaac Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that a particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This law helps scientists understand the effects of gravity on aircraft during flight, because the gravitational force between two objects increases with mass and decreases with distance.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Bernoulli’s Principle</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Mathematician and physicist Daniel Bernoulli devised the following principle in relation to hydrodynamics: within a horizontal flow of fluid, points of faster fluid speed will experience less pressure than points of slower fluid speed.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">This principle is imperative when analyzing the flow of hydraulic fluids through an aircraft. An accurate pressure flow of fluids is essential to the intricate operation of braking and flight control systems.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Bernoulli’s principle also applies to airflow during the basic phases of flight: takeoff, in-flight, and landing. The curvature of an airplane wing causes air to pass faster over the top of the wing (creating a lower pressure area) than under the wing (a higher pressure area). During takeoff, this produces the lift an airplane requires. During flight and when landing, the aircraft must compensate for and utilize all four forces of flight: <span class="bold">weight </span>(the force of gravity pushing the aircraft down), <span class="bold">lift</span> (the force required to raise the aircraft), <span class="bold">thrust </span>(the force applied in order to move the aircraft forward), and <span class="bold">drag</span> (the force that slows the aircraft down in preparation for landing).</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Drag develops from friction and changes in air pressure, which cause an aircraft to slow down. Inputs to the flight controls affect weight, lift, thrust, and drag, resulting in the aircraft speeding up, slowing down, and/or gaining or losing altitude.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Example</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">3.	</span>Which statement is true about fluid pressure according to Bernoulli’s principle?</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(A)	</span>Fluids moving at a point in a horizontal pipe at a higher speed have lower pressure than fluids moving at a point at a slower speed.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(B)	</span>Fluids moving at a point in a horizontal pipe at a higher speed have higher pressure than fluids moving at a point at a slower speed.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(C)	</span>Fluids moving along a vertical pipe at a slower speed have higher pressure than fluids moving along at a higher speed.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(D)	</span>Horizontal and vertical pipe fluid pressure levels do not change.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>The fluid pressure at constricting points along a pipe does not differ from the fluid pressure at free-flowing areas of that pipe.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Aircraft Weight and Balance</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The calculation of an aircraft’s weight and balance must be identified during preflight. It is important that the combination of passengers, baggage, usable and unusable fuel or fluids, and cargo are within established weight and balance limits. A predetermined <span class="italic">empty weight center of gravity (EWCG</span>) is provided by the aircraft’s manufacturer along with a weight limit, which is specific to each aircraft.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> <span class="bold_italic">Usable fuel</span> is the total amount of fuel expected for taxi/ground movements, flight time, and reserve fuel requirements. <span class="italic">Unusable fuel</span><span class="bold"> </span>is the amount of fuel that cannot get to the engine.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The following are acronyms of other weight specifications:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Manufacturer’s empty weight (MEW)</span> is the total weight of the aircraft as it was built. This includes systems and components required for the aircraft to operate. It does not include the weight of baggage, passengers, or either usable or unusable fuel or fluids.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Operating empty weight (OEW)</span> is the MEW plus the weight of the crew, fluids, unusable fuel, and the equipment required for flight. It does not include baggage, passengers, or usable fuel.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">All-up</span><span class="bold"> weight (AUW)</span>, or <span class="bold">aircraft gross weight (AGW)</span>, is the total aircraft weight at any given moment during a flight. The AUW decreases as fuel and fluids are consumed during the operation of the flight.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Maximum landing weight (MLW)</span> is an aircraft’s weight limit for landing. Exceeding this weight increases stress on the landing gear and may affect the distance required for a safe landing.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Maximum zero fuel weight (MZFW)</span> is the permissible weight of an aircraft with its contents and includes unusable fuel. The total MZFW excludes the weight of usable fuel on board and any consumable fluids.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Maximum takeoff weight (MTOW)</span> is an aircraft’s weight limit for takeoff. Exceeding this limit increases the power required for takeoff, lengthens the runway distance needed for a successful lift off, and places excess stress on the aircraft structure.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Maximum ramp weight (MRW)</span><span class="italic"> </span>is the weight limit for an aircraft to taxi or be towed on the ground.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Takeoff weight is determined by totaling the OEW, the cargo, the passengers, the baggage, and the taxi, flight, and reserve fuel requirements.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">The Flight Envelope</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The <span class="bold">flight envelope</span> encompasses the limits of speed, altitude, and angle of attack required by any aircraft to maintain a stable flight. An incorrect combination of these factors may result in a stall, during which the aircraft experiences a decrease in lift and a reduction in airspeed.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">angle of attack (AOA)</span> is the angle between the direction of the airflow against the wing and the <span class="bold">chord</span>, an imaginary reference line that extends from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wing.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">An aircraft’s airfoil section (wing) is designed for maximum lift and fuel efficiency. An aircraft wing is curved along its front, leading edge, which creates low pressure above and high pressure below as air passes by the wing. As air passes over the end of the wing, or over the end of a helicopter rotor blade, it changes direction, a deflection called <span class="bold">downwash</span>. This deflection of air downward helps produce lift. This is clearly visible when a helicopter hovers above water. The air deflected off the rotor blades accelerates downward, causing outward ripples in the water under the helicopter.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The trailing edge of a wing has two control parts&mdash;ailerons and flaps&mdash;which extend outward and in opposite directions to aid the aircraft in rolling. The <span class="bold">ailerons</span> are located from the midpoint of the trailing edge of the wing to the wing’s tip. The <span class="bold">flaps</span> are located from the fuselage (main cabin body) to about the midpoint of the wing. Ailerons and flaps are in a closed position (flush against the wing’s surface) during cruising altitude.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To land, the pilot first creates drag to slow the aircraft. <span class="bold">Spoilers</span> are extended upward to help reduce airspeed. As the pilot approaches the runway, the wing flaps are progressively extended too. Once the aircraft is on the ground, raising the spoilers assists in slowing the airplane while the pilot also brakes. The following figure illustrates the positions of the flaps during takeoff, flight, and landing.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Drag is air resistance experienced during flight:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Parasite drag</span> is just that&mdash;any “parasite” on the structure of the aircraft: low air pressure in the tires, skin friction, or anything that increases turbulence on the aircraft. <span class="italic">Skin friction</span> refers to any rough spot on the skin of the aircraft structure. This, along with rivet heads that may project above the skin, causes resistance to the air current flowing across the wing.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Profile drag</span> is produced mainly by the shape of the aircraft. A smaller, slimmer aircraft reduces profile drag.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Induced drag</span> is when, at the back of the wing, air flowing rapidly across the top meets air flowing more slowly underneath, creating a vortex. This type of drag depends on the performance of the aircraft. When lift, airspeed, and AOA increase, induced drag automatically increases too.</li>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">The Axes of an Aircraft</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Aircraft fly on a combination of three axes: longitudinal, lateral, and vertical. The<span class="bold"> longitudinal axis</span> (roll)<span class="bold"> </span>runs lengthwise from the nose (front) of the aircraft to the tail (rear) of the aircraft; the <span class="bold">lateral axis</span> (pitch) runs wingtip to wingtip; and the <span class="bold">vertical axis </span>(yaw) runs perpendicular to the wings at the center of the aircraft.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">The Atmosphere</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Atmospheric pressure is an extreme concern for a pilot when flying. Air weighs approximately 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi), and flight controls are calibrated for a standard atmosphere. Humidity and low air density levels reduce an aircraft’s capability for power, thrust, and lift. When the intake engines receive less air, the propellers are less efficient, and thin air applies less force on the wings, resulting in less than maximum lift.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Altitude, pressure, temperature, and humidity all affect the performance of an aircraft. The <span class="bold">pressure altimeter</span> in the cockpit is automatically calibrated for 29.92 inches of mercury (Hg). A pilot resets the pressure altitude indicator after departing an airfield to ensure the correct pressure altitude of the aircraft is displayed for the destination airfield (if it is different from the departure airfield). If this is not done, the aircraft may be at a lower altitude than what the altimeter displays.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">All aircraft perform more efficiently in colder temperatures because the air is denser than when the air is warm. However, if the temperature drops too low, de-icing of the wings may be required during preflight procedures, extending the time required to complete preflight checks.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Several designs of wings are in use in aircraft. Wings may be attached to the bottom of the fuselage (what’s called a <span class="bold">low wing</span>), to the middle of the fuselage (a <span class="bold">mid wing</span>), or on top of the fuselage (a <span class="bold">high wing</span>). If no external braces are required, the wing is of a <span class="bold">cantilever</span> design. Some smaller fixed-wing aircraft are made with a <span class="bold">semi-cantilever</span> design, meaning external braces are attached to the wings. An aircraft with two levels of wings (one above the other) is called a <span class="bold">biplane</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Wings also may be <span class="bold">dihedral</span> or <span class="bold">anhedral</span> to assist with stabilization. Note the angle of the wings in Figure 12.8.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The wings of an aircraft enable lift; the characteristics of the airfoil determine the lift capabilities.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">chord</span>,<span class="bold"> </span>touched on earlier, is the imaginary line in an airfoil; it establishes a baseline for the amount of camber and width required of the wing along its wingspan (the distance from one wingtip to the other wingtip). When the measurements of the chord line and the camber line differ greatly, the curvature of the wing will provide more lift.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Thickness</span> is a percentage of the wing chord; it typically ranges from 6.5 to 13.5 percent.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">camber line</span> is the amount of curvature of the wing. This additional imaginary line runs halfway between the upper and lower surfaces of the wing.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">There are four types of wing planforms:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The <span class="bold">rectangular </span>is the simplest type, highly inefficient, and typically used for light general aviation.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The <span class="bold">elliptical </span>is the most efficient style, with the lowest possible induced drag.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The <span class="bold">tapered </span>is a cross between a rectangular and an elliptical, providing better lift distribution and moderate efficiency. Aircraft with these wings have a wide range of speeds.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The <span class="bold">swept </span>is tapered back to reduce drag. This category includes slightly swept, moderately swept, and sharply swept types. The disadvantages of the swept wing planform include its tendency to twist under stress. The delta wing, found on supersonic aircraft, is a highly swept triangular type that is very strong and has the ability to hold a large volume of fuel. Unlike the more standard swept wings, though, the delta has a high incidence of induced drag.</li>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">The Powerplant</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">An aircraft’s <span class="bold">powerplant</span> encompasses the engines and propellers as well as the induction, exhaust, electrical, cooling, lubrication, and fuel systems.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In accordance with Newton’s third law of motion, an aircraft must generate enough thrust to create enough lift to overcome the drag produced during flight. Thrust is accomplished by converting an exploding gas-air mixture into mechanical energy in an <span class="bold">engine</span>. In modern turbofan engines, this mechanical energy turns the fan to produce thrust, much the same as a propeller on a smaller aircraft. The fan or propeller has an airfoil shape which produces “left” in the forward direction, referred to as thrust. Typically, aircraft with a cruising speed not exceeding 250 mph use a <span class="italic">reciprocating engine</span>. Larger, more powerful aircraft use a <span class="italic">gas turbine engine</span>. Aircraft traveling at high altitudes (above 30,000 feet) use a <span class="italic">turbo-supercharged</span><span class="italic"> reciprocating engine</span>. Aircraft operating at Mach 1 or higher use a <span class="italic">turbojet engine</span>; the afterburner on this engine enhances the power to reach such high speeds.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">All engines must also meet certain requirements for fuel efficiency. During takeoff, engines operate at maximum performance. The level of power is cut back during the climb and then reduced to a fuel-efficient level when the aircraft levels off at cruising speed.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Thrust Horsepower equation: <span class="italic">thp</span> = (thrust × aircraft speed in mph)/375 pph<br class="calibre8" /><span class="bold_italic">thp</span>: thrust horsepower<br class="calibre8" /><span class="bold">Aircraft speed</span>: in miles per hour (mph)<br class="calibre8" /><span class="bold">pph</span>: pounds per hour</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">There are a few types of <span class="bold">propellers</span>. The <span class="italic">fixed pitch propeller</span> is set by the manufacturer. The <span class="italic">variable pitch propeller</span> allows the pilot to adjust the blade pitch during flight. A <span class="italic">pusher propeller</span> is installed on the rear of an aircraft and faces to the rear; the thrust created from its rotation pushes instead of pulls the aircraft, contrary to the fixed and variable pitch propellers. The pitch of any style of propeller affects the way it cuts through the air, producing air mass.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">The Landing Gear</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The landing gear must support the weight of an aircraft during takeoff, landing, and ground maneuvering. The styles of landing gear include the following: tail wheel, tandem, and tricycle landing gear.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">When an aircraft’s main landing gear is positioned forward of its center of gravity, the use of a <span class="bold">tail wheel</span> system is required. This type of landing gear consists of a third wheel assembly, which is beneficial for landing on non-paved runways. Improvements to the assembly allow for steering the tail wheel through the rudder.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Tandem</span> landing gear has both main and tail portions mounted along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. This style supports the use of very flexible wings.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Tricycle</span> landing gear includes a main gear and a nose gear, which together support increased braking ability, higher landing speeds, and better visibility for ground operations. The nose gear is steered through either mechanical linkage or, in larger aircraft, hydraulic power. Having multiple wheels on each main gear improves safety if one tire fails.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">The Tail Assembly</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The rear portion of an aircraft is the tail assembly (also known as the <span class="italic">empennage</span>). It provides stability to the aircraft and consists of a rudder, a vertical stabilizer, a horizontal stabilizer, the trim tabs, and two elevators.</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">rudder</span> and the <span class="bold">vertical stabilizer</span> are part of the <span class="italic">vertical tail structure</span>. The rudder is at the rear of the vertical tail structure and is used to keep the aircraft in coordinated flight. The vertical stabilizer, further forward, prevents the aircraft from yawing back and forth.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">horizontal stabilizer</span> and the <span class="bold">elevators</span> are part of the <span class="italic">horizontal tail structure</span>. The horizontal stabilizer is at the front of the horizontal tail structure; it prevents the aircraft from pitching up and down. The elevators are hinged to the horizontal stabilizer; they direct the up and down motion of the aircraft’s nose.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Trim tabs</span> are on the trailing edges of the wings toward the fuselage, the rudder, and the elevators. Adjusting angles of the trim tabs acts as a secondary flight control system, helping to offset an undesirable attitude of the aircraft and relieving pressure on the controls. Moving trim tabs on the elevators shifts the elevators in the opposite direction: aiming the trim tabs down moves the elevators up, and aiming the trim tabs up moves the elevators down, relieving pressure on the controls. (Trim tabs located on the wings assist with stabilizing the aircraft if a wing dips left or right unnecessarily, maintaining the aircraft’s center of gravity.)</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">The Flight Controls</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Flight control instrumentation devices in the cockpit allow the pilot to manage the performance, attitude, and movement of an aircraft. Every aircraft has both a primary and a secondary flight control system.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">primary flight control system</span> manages the <span class="italic">ailerons</span>, <span class="italic">elevators</span>, and <span class="italic">rudder</span>. These devices are designed for the safe maneuvering of the aircraft and the elimination of over-controlling measures introduced by the pilot. An input to this system changes the airflow and pressure distribution needed to ensure a smooth flight. As mentioned earlier, all aircraft fly along three axes: longitudinal, vertical, and lateral. A smooth adjustment correcting aircraft movement directly affects roll, pitch, and yaw of the aircraft. The ailerons keep roll in check along the longitudinal axis. The elevators stabilize pitch along the lateral axis. The rudder controls yaw movement along the vertical axis.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">secondary flight control system</span> manages the <span class="italic">wing flaps</span>, <span class="italic">leading edge devices</span>, <span class="italic">spoilers</span>, and <span class="italic">trim tabs</span>. This system assists the pilot in optimizing aircraft performance during flight. An input to this system increases lift and adjusts drag. During takeoff and landing, a pilot maximizes the airflow needed for lift by adjusting the wing flaps. Devices such as moveable slats are added to the leading edges of the flaps to increase the available AOA and avoid a stall. The trailing edges of the flaps extend from the wings to increase drag and thus slow the aircraft when landing. Spoilers are also used to reduce lift, increase drag, and control speed when descending. Additionally, they assist the aircraft to roll (bank) to the right or left. The trim system, as mentioned earlier, improves the overall attitude of an aircraft by relieving pressure on the controls.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Also inside the cockpit are the<span class="bold"> </span>throttle, joystick or control wheel, and pedals, which coordinate the movement of the aircraft. The <span class="bold">throttle</span> increases and decreases power. The <span class="bold">joystick or control wheel</span> directs the aircraft left, right, nose up, and nose down. The <span class="bold">pedals</span> shift the rudder, which moves the aircraft left or right.</p>

			<h2 id="calibre_link-248" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-249"></a>The Four Fundamental Flight Maneuvers</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The four fundamentals of flight are <span class="bold">straight-and</span><span class="bold">-level flight</span>, <span class="bold">turns</span>,<span class="bold"> climbs</span>, and <span class="bold">descents</span>.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Straight-and-Level Flight</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The key to smooth flight is the handling of the flight controls by the pilot. The controls should be held with a light touch, not gripped strongly. Straight-and-level flight is achieved when the aircraft is in cruising mode and the four forces of flight&mdash;weight, lift, thrust, and drag&mdash;are in balance. Straight-and-level flight still requires a monitoring of the controls, but it does not necessarily require moving the controls when the aircraft is not set to autopilot. Avoiding rash inputs on the flight controls maintains a smooth flight.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">When an aircraft banks, it tends to change attitude while in the turn. After the turn is complete, the altitude indicator (among the flight instruments discussed later) will confirm the aircraft’s heading. The pilot must ensure the natural reference point of the horizon and the perpendicular positions of the wings to return to level flight.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Example</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">15.	</span>Which of the following is NOT considered necessary to achieve straight-and-level flight?</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>avoiding rash inputs</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Turns</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">When an aircraft is turned, its ailerons should be banked toward the direction of the turn. The degree of the bank angle determines how much input and adjustment a pilot must make to restore the airplane or helicopter to level flight. The lift force acts at the same angle as the angle of bank to tilt the aircraft away from the vertical. To return to level flight, the vertical lift component must equal the weight of the aircraft. When a pilot pulls back on the stick (or cyclic in helicopters), the total lift is greater than the total aircraft weight, counterbalancing the vertical lift component with the weight to maintain altitude. The horizontal lift component becomes unbalanced and causes the aircraft to accelerate inward to perform the turn.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To perform a turn, the following actions are required.</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The pilot first moves the stick (or cyclic): to the left for left turns or to the right for right turns.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">Enough power or pitching up is also added to counteract the loss of lift.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">The controls are neutralized to stop any increase in the bank angle and to maintain the desired bank angle.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul">After the turn is accomplished, the ailerons are leveled to resume flight.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">During a turn maneuver, a pilot must maintain visual reference with the horizon and keep alert to the aircraft limits of airspeed and attitude displayed on the flight instruments. Typically, altitude and airspeed decrease in a turn. The elevators are used to hold altitude, and the throttle is used to increase speed. As airspeed and altitude decrease, a stall and loss of lift on the wings may result. In this case, the pilot must lower the AOA by one of several means to apply power.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">There are three types of turns: shallow, medium, and steep turns. A <span class="bold">shallow turn </span>consists of a bank of up to 20 degrees; after such a turn, the stability of an aircraft naturally returns it to level flight without pilot interference. The bank of<span class="bold"> </span>a<span class="bold"> medium turn</span> is between 20 and 45 degrees; the pilot during this turn must input aileron pressure to return the aircraft to level flight. A <span class="bold">steep turn</span> includes any bank greater than 45 degrees; after a steep turn the pilot must input opposite pressure on the controls to return the aircraft to level flight.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Example</h4>
			<p class="sample_questions_question"><span class="bold">16.	</span>What action must a pilot perform when flying out of a steep turn that is not usually required during a shallow or medium turn?</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Climbs</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">A <span class="bold">climb</span> is when an aircraft flight path changes from a lower to a higher level in altitude. During this maneuver, a pilot must increase lift to overcome the aircraft’s weight. Climbing without increasing thrust results in a decrease in airspeed. The corrective action is to input additional thrust without exceeding the aircraft’s maximum power settings.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">normal climb</span>&mdash;sometimes referred to as a <span class="bold">cruise climb</span>&mdash;is performed within the aircraft manufacturer’s standards; the aircraft increases airspeed, but it may not be operating at its optimum performance. A <span class="bold">best rate of climb</span> (V<span class="sub_italic">y </span>) involves gaining the most altitude in a given amount of time using the most power available to reach cruising altitude. This climb is steeper than a normal climb and results in the greatest altitude gain over a set amount of time. It is used when an aircraft must take off or gain altitude quickly. A <span class="bold">best angle of climb </span>(V<span class="sub_italic">x </span>) involves gaining the most altitude over a given distance. This climb is also used during takeoff but especially at airports where there are obstructions in the flight path. Navigating obstacles typically requires this climbing technique.</p>
			<h4 class="sample_questions_sample_heading">Example</h4>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(D)	</span>The best rate of climb accomplishes the best climb angle over a given distance.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_choice"><span class="bold">(E)	</span>A best rate of climb is also referred to as a <span class="italic">cruise climb</span>.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Descents</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The opposite of a climb in aviation is a <span class="bold">descent</span>. When lift is decreased, induced drag is minimized, and the aircraft has a tendency to gain airspeed and thrust. Engine power levels must be reduced to maintain airspeed and avoid an excess speed situation.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">partial power descent</span> is the preferred way to decrease altitude. During this type of descent the aircraft should drop at a rate of 500 feet per minute (fpm). A <span class="bold">descent at minimum safe airspeed </span><span class="bold">(MSA) </span>is a nose-high controlled descent used to clear obstacles on short approach to a short runway. The aircraft’s angle during this descent is steeper than during a partial power descent. An <span class="bold">emergency descent</span> occurs when the aircraft rapidly loses altitude. Emergency procedures dictate the power settings and control positions for all emergency descents.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A fixed-wing aircraft is by design able to <span class="bold">glide</span> for a short distance, including during a descent with little or no engine power; gravity naturally takes over.

			<h2 id="calibre_link-250" class="body_text_heading"><a id="calibre_link-251"></a>Rotary-Wing Aircraft</h2>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="italic">Disclaimer: For the purposes of this section we will be discussing a helicopter with an underslung rotor system and </span><span class="italic">skid-type</span><span class="italic"> landing gear. Popular versions of this type of aircraft include the Bell 206B3 (US Army </span><span class="italic">TH-67</span><span class="italic">) and the Bell 205 (US Army </span><span class="italic">UH-1</span><span class="italic">).</span></p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Rotary-Wing Aircraft Structure</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The major components of a rotary-wing aircraft allow the aircraft to hover and fly directionally. Some of the most vital of these will be detailed in this section.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">mast</span> (also known as the <span class="bold">shaft</span>) is a long cylindrical component that extends vertically from the main rotor transmission up to the <span class="bold">main rotor hub</span>. The mast is responsible for the rotational drive force that turns the main rotor hub, where all components of the main rotor head are attached. These include the blade grips, the rotor blades, the pitch horn (or yoke), the stabilizer bar and weight (or flybar), and the teeter hinge (or trunnion).</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> The twisting movement of helicopter blade grips is due to a component installed inside them. Wire is wrapped several hundred times around two opposing spindles and then completely covered in a flexible polymer that forms a blade grip. As blade grips twist on their ball bearings, these internal wire tension-torsion (TT) straps work like large rubber bands to prevent centrifugal force from allowing the blades to be pulled from the rotor head. Without these straps the rotational forces exerted on the rotor blades would be so great they would fly off in opposite directions.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">blade grips</span> connect the rotor blades to the rotor system. The primary responsibility of the blade grips is to allow the rotor blades to feather. <span class="italic">Feathering</span> is a term used to describe the change of the blades’ angle relative to their rotation plane (also known as <span class="italic">angle of attack</span>).</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Rotor blades </span>are most often made of metal, but as rotorcraft and composite technologies evolve, more rotor blades are being made of composites such as fiberglass or carbon fiber. The rotor blades give a rotary-wing aircraft lift. Shaped much like airplane wings, the airfoils of rotor blades, when spun along a rotational axis, ultimately create lift for the aircraft.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">pitch horn</span> (or <span class="bold">yoke</span>) extends perpendicular to the main rotor blades. It connects directly to the blade grips and stabilizer bar and receives control inputs from the pitch links. Its job is to collect control input from the pilot and translate that input into force, moving the blade grips. This force feathers the blades, or changes their angle of attack.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">stabilizer bar and weight</span> (or <span class="bold">flybar</span>) help to maintain a constant plane of rotation for the rotor blades. The stabilizer bar is connected to the swashplate (described more fully later in this section) via a series of mechanical linkages, which combine with the stabilizer bar to dampen any over-control by the pilot as well as help the aircraft weather extreme wind gusts, thereby reducing pilot workload.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">teeter hinge</span> (also known as the<span class="bold"> trunnion</span>) connects the mast to the main rotor hub. The teeter hinge allows the rotor hub and blades to flap up or down depending on control input and aerodynamic forces. As one blade rises, the teeter hinge enables the opposite blade to fall in its plane of rotation, much like the up and down of a teeter-totter.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Below the mast and the main rotor hub’s components is the main rotor transmission. Mounted to this transmission is the <span class="bold">swashplate</span>, without which directional control of a rotary-wing aircraft would not be possible. Although there are a number of helicopter rotor designs, from the single main rotor to the tandem rotor (like the CH-47 Chinook) to the coaxial rotor (like the Kamov KA-50), all these aircraft have a swashplate. The two primary components of the swashplate&mdash;the inner, or non-rotating, swashplate and the outer, or rotating, swashplate&mdash;form concentric rings, which rest on a type of bearing. This bearing allows the swashplate to tilt along a horizontal plane as well as move up and down. The mast runs through the center of the swashplate, and as the mast turns, driving the main rotor system, a <span class="bold">scissors link</span> connected to the mast in turn drives the outer, rotating swashplate. The inner, non-rotating swashplate lifts and tilts, controlling the directional movement of the outer, rotating swashplate, which changes the pitch of the rotor blades.</p>

			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">tail boom</span> is the structural component of the helicopter that supports the tail rotor and in some cases the directional fins.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> The tail boom of most light rotary-wing aircraft has almost no internal support structure. On the Bell 206B3 Jet Ranger there is structural reinforcement where the tail boom couples with the fuselage and where the tail rotor gearbox couples with the tail boom, but the rest of the tail boom is hollow.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In a helicopter design known as a NOTAR (no tail rotor), a <span class="bold">ducted fan</span> is used in place of a traditional tail rotor to cancel out torque effect or the counter-rotating force applied to the airframe as a main rotor system turns. This ducted fan is usually connected to the engine, and as the fan rotates, it creates thrust similar to that of a rotating propeller. As this thrust is forced through a duct in the tail boom it is vented out the back of the aircraft at a 90-degree angle and is controlled by a louver that allows either more or less air to pass out of the thrust opening. It is this vectored thrust that gives a NOTAR rotary-wing aircraft directional control in the hover and cancels out torque effect.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">The Physics of Rotary-Wing Aircraft</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Hovering flight is the balance of the four aerodynamic forces&mdash;weight, lift, thrust, and drag&mdash;at a given period of time. In a rotary-wing aircraft during a hover, these forces are in opposition straight up and straight down. In order for the aircraft to hover, it has to overcome its weight via the generation of lift. If lift is greater than the aircraft’s weight, then the helicopter rises from the ground.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A rotary-wing aircraft creates lift via the rotational movement of its airfoils. As its rotor blades turn, the slow-moving high-pressure air below the blades pushes up against the faster-moving low-pressure air above the blades. This upward force is known as the <span class="bold">Magnus effect</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> The Magnus effect was first described (though not named) by Isaac Newton in 1672. In fact, in 1742 a British mathematician named Benjamin Robins arguably described the Magnus effect, though only as it relates to the trajectory of a spinning musket ball. However, the force itself would not actually be <span class="italic">called</span> the Magnus effect until 1852, when German physicist Gustav Magnus officially “discovered” it.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Once the aircraft is airborne, it must produce enough lift and thrust to counteract the weight and drag of the aircraft and keep the aircraft in the air. As long as the helicopter maintains a balance between these forces, it will remain in a stabilized hover, suspended in a column of air created by the rotational movement of the rotor blades. This column of air passing through the rotor blades is known as <span class="bold">induced flow</span>, or<span class="bold"> </span>downwash.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">While the aircraft is in a stabilized hover, it is attempting to counteract another aerodynamic principle of vertical flight: translating tendency. <span class="bold">Translating tendency</span> is the tendency of a rotary-<br class="calibre8" />wing aircraft to drift laterally due to tail rotor thrust. The tail rotor of a rotary-wing aircraft is used to counteract torque and to provide directional control of the aircraft. As the main rotor blades turn, the airframe wants to rotate opposite to that movement. The tail rotor creates the horizontal thrust necessary to counteract that rotational pull of the airframe, which results in the helicopter drifting laterally&mdash;its translating tendency.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Gyroscopic precession</span> is another aerodynamic factor exhibited in rotary-wing aircraft. When a force is applied to a rotating rotor, the force will be felt 90 degrees later in the plane of rotation, just as it would in a gyroscope. For example, if force is applied at the six o’clock position of a counterclockwise spinning component, the force is felt or viewed at the three o’clock position.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">As a rotary-wing aircraft moves forward, the next aerodynamic factor it will encounter is known as <span class="bold">transverse flow effect</span>. When the helicopter begins to accelerate, the induced flow created by the lifting action of the rotor blades drops to nearly zero in the front half of the rotor system and increases in the rear half of the rotor system. This drop in induced flow causes the angle of attack in the front half of the rotor system to increase, causing the blades to flap up. In contrast, as the induced flow increases in the rear half of the rotor system, the angle of attack decreases, causing the blades to flap down. Due to gyroscopic precession, the displacement of the flapping blades is not felt until 90 degrees later in the plane of rotation, which causes the rotary-wing aircraft to roll laterally.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Translational lift</span> is another factor that rotary-wing aircraft have to contend with. While a rotary-wing aircraft hovers, the induced flow created is nearly vertical. As this vertical column of air hits the ground, it extends outward in all directions and often is pulled back vertically to be recirculated through the aircraft’s rotor system. This movement of air creates vortices at the ends of the rotor blades. It is these vortices that hinder the effectiveness of the rotor system, requiring more power for the aircraft to stay aloft.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To achieve an <span class="italic">effective translational lift</span> <span class="italic">(ETL), </span>the efficiency of the main rotor system must be increased. When an aircraft moves either forward or laterally, it begins to outrun its rotor vortices and thereby creates greater efficiency in the rotor system. The efficiency is not directionally equal, though, since the rotor system does not outrun different vortices at the same time. As the forward half of the rotor system becomes more efficient, the blades flap up, creating more lift and causing the nose of the aircraft to pitch up and, due to gyroscopic precession, to roll laterally. Both transverse flow effect and translational lift can be countered by using the cyclic pitch control (detailed in the upcoming controls section), which can tip the aircraft’s plane of rotation.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Lifting forces in the main rotor are not equal at all times either. <span class="bold">Dissymmetry of lift </span>is an unequal lifting of forces created by the advancing and retreating blades. As a rotary-wing aircraft moves forward through the air, <span class="italic">relative wind</span> is created, which is the motion of air across an airfoil. As a counterclockwise rotating blade moves an aircraft forward, it encounters fast-moving air along the right-hand side of that aircraft. As it encounters this fast-moving air, more lift is created. Conversely, the leading edge of the airfoil on the left-hand side of the aircraft&mdash;the retreating blade&mdash;does not run into fast-moving air; therefore lift decreases. Due to this difference in lift between the advancing and retreating halves of the rotor system, the aircraft is inclined to roll toward the left.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">One of the things that make a rotary-wing aircraft unique is its ability to autorotate. <span class="bold">Autorotation </span>is a situation in which the rotor blades are driven by relative wind rather than by the aircraft’s powerplant. For example, in the event of an engine failure a pilot can adjust his or her flight controls to allow the induced flow of air through the rotor system to reverse the aircraft’s direction. As gravity pulls the aircraft back to the ground, this induced flow can travel vertically through the rotor system and continue to drive the blades in their plane of rotation. As long as the rotor system is turning, the pilot can maintain full directional control of the aircraft and steer it to a suitable landing area. The rotor system stores inertia, giving the pilot an opportunity to cushion the helicopter upon landing. This is a skilled maneuver and if not performed well can cause the rotor system to lose all rotational movement and, in turn, the last remaining vestiges of lift.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Rotary-Wing Aircraft Controls</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">There are four primary controls of the rotary-wing aircraft. The <span class="bold">cyclic control system</span>, mounted on the flight deck floor and centered between the pilot’s legs, is utilized to adjust the aircraft’s pitch and roll axes. A causal effect of the spinning motion of rotor blades is vertical thrust. As the blades spin, a column of air is created that the pilot can manipulate via the use of the helicopter’s flight controls. When the cyclic control is pushed forward, the column of air supporting the rotary-wing aircraft is directed aft, creating a forward lift vector that moves the helicopter forward. This cyclic movement is able to change the direction of the lift vector up to 360 degrees around the aircraft, allowing a pilot to hover in one location.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The <span class="bold">collective control</span>, located to the left of the pilot’s seat,<span class="bold"> </span>is used to “collectively” change the pitch of the rotor blades. When the pilot raises the collective, the pitch angle of the blades increases simultaneously. As the pitch angle increases, so does the angle of attack of the blades; this in turn creates more lift. To perform a level climb the pilot simply pulls the collective up; to descend, he or she pushes it down.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Yaw control of the aircraft is adjusted by the use of the <span class="bold">tail rotor pedals</span>, or the <span class="bold">directional controls.</span> Much like the collective control over the main rotor system, the tail rotor pedals change the pitch of the tail rotor blades, causing a larger or smaller horizontal lifting vector.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Many modern rotary-wing aircraft also have a self-governing <span class="bold">throttle control</span>, meaning once the throttle is switched to a flight setting, engine performance is managed by a computer. Smaller as well as some older aircraft have a manual throttle control, which requires the pilot to increase and reduce the throttle to maintain optimal flying parameters. The throttle can be located in a variety of places within the aircraft, but the majority of throttle controls are found on the collective control in the form of an attached twisting grip, very similar to a collar. By twisting this grip, the throttle can be either increased or decreased.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">A pilot uses outside visual reference cues against the horizon to maneuver a helicopter. When weather degrades to less than the minimum visual flight rules (VFR), flight instruments must be relied upon for guiding the helicopter along the flight path, providing altitude, heading, and airspeed. The altimeter, the airspeed indicator, and the vertical speed indicator are common pitot-static instruments. A pitot tube and static ports extend outside the aircraft’s structure to collect the outside air and static pressure. The air passes through a pitot line to the instruments calibrated to measure the aircraft’s altitude and speed.</p>
			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Altimeter</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">An altimeter displays the altitude of a helicopter. It computes this by measuring the atmospheric pressure at the aircraft’s current altitude and comparing this to a preset value. Air pressure decreases 1 inch of mercury for each 1,000 feet of altitude.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">There are three types of altimeters: the three-pointer, the counter drum, and the encoding.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Of the three “hands” on a <span class="bold">three-pointer</span><span class="bold"> altimeter</span>, the longest, thinnest hand displays altitude in tens of thousands of feet; the shortest hand displays thousands of feet; and the medium-length hand displays hundreds of feet.

Long vertical hash marks identify 10-degree increments, and short vertical hashes identify 5-degree increments. Due to nearby electromagnetic interference from metal structures and electrical components in an aircraft, <span class="bold">compass magnetic deviation</span> exists. This deviation is allowable up to 10 degrees.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> Compass deviations are caused by electromagnetic influences on the magnets in the compass.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">When the compass card is not level, the magnets dip downward toward Earth. This process, called <span class="bold">magnetic dip</span>, happens when the aircraft is in a bank toward the west or east or when it is accelerating or decelerating while on a west or east heading. Also, when on a west or east heading, any increase in airspeed during a turn causes the compass to reflect a false turn toward the north. A decrease in airspeed during the turn causes the compass to reflect a false turn toward the south.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Also, it is common for the direction on magnetic compasses to lag when an aircraft makes a turn. For example, when turning left from a north heading, the compass turns right to 30 degrees and will reset itself once 270 degrees is reached. When turning from a south heading, the compass leads at the same rate of location at degrees latitude. If the aircraft was at 40 degrees latitude, the pilot would have to roll back approximately 40 degrees past the south reading.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A number of other variations and errors can occur with a compass. A compass dial aligns itself with the north and south <span class="bold">magnetic poles</span>, not with geographic true north and south. Pilots fly with the aid of sectional charts that use the geographic poles instead. The difference between true north or south and magnetic north or south is called <span class="bold">magnetic variation</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">To identify the variation (in degrees) between magnetic and geographic north, say, a pilot must convert true north (from the sectional charts) to magnetic north (from the aircraft’s magnetic compass). If the magnetic variation is east of true north, the degree of variation is subtracted from the map’s true heading. If the magnetic variation is west of true north, that degree of variation is added to the map’s true heading. The line where the true north and magnetic north variation is zero degrees is called an <span class="bold">agonic line</span>. Lines where the variation is greater or less than zero degrees are called <span class="bold">isogonic lines</span>.</p>
			<p class="body_text_sidebar_text"><span class="bold">Helpful Hint:</span> East is least, west is best. Subtract the degree of variation if the variation is east of true north; add the degree of variation if the variation is west of true north.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Compass deviations may be corrected by using an airfield’s compass rose. These indications are recorded on a compass compensation card placed near the compass in the cockpit.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Heading Indicator </h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The heading indicator is similar to a magnetic compass but functions with a gyroscope and is not subject to the magnetic deviations inherent in magnetic compasses. Direction in this indicator is defined by the aircraft’s horizontal plane. When this plane does not match Earth’s horizon, a gimbal error exists, called a <span class="bold">drift</span>. This drift needs to be corrected every ten to fifteen minutes by confirming the heading using the magnetic compass.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading_no_space">Runway Design and Function</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees airport designs and improvements for federal airports, and has established a twenty-year structural design life expectancy for runway pavements. Runway materials must hold up to the stresses placed on them from the weight and impact of aircraft, and foreign object damage (FOD). Runways must also avoid causing undue wear on aircraft tires and provide water runoff and protection from harsh weather conditions.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Currently runways must be 9 to 12 inches deep at regional airfields capable of servicing smaller aircraft. Hub airports frequented by jumbo jets require a 15- to 18-inch depth of pavement. Of the different runway designs, a <span class="bold">flexible pavement</span> consists of hot-mix asphalt installed on a base course and subbase, if required. This type of pavement resists cracking (versus rigid pavements). A <span class="bold">full-depth</span><span class="bold"> asphalt pavement</span> contains asphaltic cement as its main material. A <span class="bold">rigid pavement</span> may use rubberized Portland cement as a subbase. All pavement styles consist of layers: a base course (stabilized), a subbase, and a subgrade, and it is important that loose, gritty material does not exist between the layers.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Runway lengths are dependent on several factors, including the type of aircraft expected to use the runway, the expected maximum takeoff weight (MTOW), the elevation of the airfield, and the maximum local air temperature.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The movement area of an airfield includes the aprons and areas for takeoff, landing, and taxiing. Runway markings are designed to guide an aircraft through a safe landing and takeoff. Runways are defined by their markings, and there are three types.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy"><span class="bold">Visual runway markings</span> are visible so a pilot can view them as the aircraft approaches the runway. These runways are commonly small airstrips.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">nonprecision instrument runway</span> is generally found in small- to medium-size airports and displays a centerline, a threshold mark, and designators, as well as a visual cue called an <span class="italic">aiming point</span>&mdash;a wide strip located on both sides of the runway and approximately 1,000 feet from the landing threshold. This signifies the runway contains navigation facilities for an instrument approach with only horizontal guidance.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">A <span class="bold">precision instrument runway</span>, found in larger airports, displays all the same markings of a nonprecision instrument runway as well as a touchdown zone and side stripes. This type of runway also contains an <span class="italic">instrument landing system (ILS)</span> or <span class="italic">precision approach radar (PAR)</span>. An ILS approach receives radio responses that provide both vertical and horizontal guidance (if a pilot is too low or too high, or too far left or right, as the aircraft approaches). Additionally, a runway number identifies the approach direction as read from a magnetic azimuth and left, center, and right designations identify parallel runways.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Along with physical design, features such as approach lighting and instrumentation requirements limit the type of aircraft a runway may service. <span class="bold">Runway end identification lights (REILs)</span> are synchronized illuminated lights placed on each side of the runway threshold to help a pilot identify the approach end of a runway. Additionally, the lights at the end of the runway are red, and outward from the runway end they are green, to indicate the threshold. <span class="bold">Runway edge lights</span> identify the edges of the runway. These are of variable intensity and white in color, although instrument runways have yellow edge lighting along the last 2,000 feet, or half the length of runway, whichever is less.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">An<span class="bold"> approach light system (ALS)</span> assists a pilot in transitioning from instrument flight to visual flight for landing. Some airports have the flashing lights blink sequentially to guide a pilot to the end of the runway under instrument landings. A <span class="bold">visual approach slope indicator (VASI)</span> will assist with descents during visual landings. Each indicator has a white light on the upper portion and a red light on the lower portion to identify to the pilot his or her position along the glide path to the runway.</p>

			<h3 class="body_text_subheading">Airspace</h3>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph">Controlled airspace is the area controlled and maintained by the FAA-regulated air traffic control (ATC) service. This service controls the movement of all aviation assets within its designated area.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Airspace is divided into six classes by the FAA. (Note that aircraft must have operable equipment and meet certain certification to operate in certain classes. Student and recreational pilots must also be certified to conduct flight operations in certain classes of airspace. Pilots are required to contact the ATC controller to obtain clearance, when necessary, prior to inadvertently entering any controlled airspace.)</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Class A</span>&mdash;Airspace from 18,000 feet MSL to pressure altitude of 60,000 feet, 12 nautical miles (NM) off the coast of the United States, and international airspace beyond 12 NM that is within the navigational signal of ATC radar. All aircraft must operate under instrument flight rules (IFR) at this level.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Class B</span>&mdash;Airspace from ground level to 10,000 feet MSL surrounding the busiest airports capable of IFR operations and commercial passenger traffic. ATC clearance is required to enter and leave this airspace. Aircraft and pilots must be certified to operate in this airspace.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Class C</span>&mdash;Airspace from ground level to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation surrounding airports with an operational control tower and serviced by radar approach control, IFR operations, and commercial passenger traffic. Airspace extends from 5 NM radius (surface to 4,000 feet above airport elevation) to 10 NM radius from 1,200 to 4,000 feet. No pilot certification is required to operate in this airspace; however, clearance is required to enter and exit this airspace. A two-way radio and an operable radar beacon transponder with automatic altitude reporting equipment are required.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Class D</span>&mdash;Airspace from ground level to 2,500 feet above the airport elevation surrounding airports with an operational control tower. Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) identify any specific requirements for pilots to operate in this controlled airspace. A two-way radio is required to operate in this airspace.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Class E</span>&mdash;Any controlled airspace not included in class A through class D. Special VFR operations are permitted with prior clearance obtained by the controlling facility. Class E airspace is distinguished on sectional charts in blue or magenta, and white on low altitude en route charts. No specific pilot or equipment requirement exists.</li>
				<li class="body_text_lists_ul"><span class="bold">Class G</span>&mdash;Uncontrolled airspace with visibility requirements of 1 mile during the day and 3 miles at night. This airspace is valid for altitudes 1,200 feet AGL to 10,000 feet MSL. Above 10,000 feet, 5 miles of visibility is required day or night. Class G airspace is identified on sectional maps by a faded, thick blue line.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">For any airspace, required flight visibility is 3 statute miles, except in Class A and Class E. There are established elevations where aircraft must remain clear of clouds in the controlled airspace. These restrictions are typically 1,000 feet above the clouds, 500 feet below the clouds, and anywhere from 1,000 feet to 1 statute mile when horizontal with the clouds. Obstacles and urban development may preclude the ability to abide by these set restrictions, but a pilot must display good judgment in this case.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph"><span class="italic">This part of the test measures your ability to read and understand written material. Each passage is followed by a series of </span><span class="italic">multiple-choice</span><span class="italic"> questions. You are to choose the option that best answers the question based on the passage. No additional information or specific knowledge is needed.</span></p>
			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph-space2">Much of the complexity of the Korean War derives from the very different perspectives of the participants. In reality, the conflict was actually three wars in one, with each faction believing itself to be protecting Korea from an oppressive, invasive force. The participants can be visualized as three concentric circles of increasingly indirect interest in the war.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In the outermost circle were the United States and the Soviet Union. For these two countries, Korea was simply the next stage in their ongoing battle for global power. In 1945, the Soviets invaded Manchuria in their campaign against Japan and seized control of Korea. When the war ended, the United States&mdash;in agreement with the Soviet Union&mdash;sent an expeditionary force to southern Korea to disarm and repatriate the hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers and citizens there. With Soviet troops in the north and American troops in the south, neither side wanted to relinquish control. The Soviets, excluded from the occupation of Japan, feared an American attempt to control Asia; the United States feared the same from the Soviets as the USSR became increasingly supportive of the Chinese communists.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">As a compromise, the two powers decided to temporarily divide Korea on the thirty-eighth parallel, keeping their respective troops in place. Each installed a pliable government, but tensions grew within each part of Korea. Internal resistance to foreign occupation as well as aggressive moves from the north and the Soviet Union to reunite the country ultimately resulted in war in 1950.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In the middle ring of participants were the nations of Asia. Suffering from the aftermath of World War II, few Asian countries were able to actively participate in the Korean War, although all watched events closely. The exception was China, which was undergoing its own political transformation.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">With the support of the Soviet Union, Mao Zedong seized control of China and established the People’s Republic of China in 1949. The United States perceived Zedong’s success to be a serious blow to both American political ideas and American global power. But Zedong’s dominance was not complete: a second Chinese government persisted, exiled to Taiwan but politically sanctioned by the United States. Korea’s fate, then, was dependent on the future security of each of these two Chinas. In addition, all of Asia was concerned about containing Japan, which had pursued aggressive imperialism on the mainland since the end of the nineteenth century, conquering Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, and parts of China. The question of the Korean War became a question of which government could best keep Japan at bay.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Finally, in the innermost circle were North Korea and South Korea, the two supposedly temporary states created by the World War II allies and controlled by opposing governments. For these two factions, the war was a civil war. Before 1945, Korea did not view itself as two different countries but as one unified nation. However, that nation had been occupied by Japan for much of its history, making it automatically resistant to the interference of both Soviet and American troops. The division of the country, while militarily reasonable for the United States and the Soviet Union, was incredibly damaging to Korea itself. The country’s most valuable resources&mdash;its gold and coal mines, fertilizer and concrete plants, and hydroelectric power system&mdash;were all concentrated in the northern zone. However, the scarce arable land and two-thirds of the people were in the southern zone. Economically crippled and resentful of another long occupation, communist leaders in the South revolted against American troops, attempting to seize control from the UN-approved government.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Kim Il-sung, the communist leader of North Korea, enjoying enthusiastic support from the Soviet Union and reluctantly backed by China, capitalized on the unrest to attempt to reunite the country under his rule. The resulting war brought all these various actors, motivations, and agendas into a conflict in which no clear winner would emerge. The only guarantee who was a loser: the Korean nation.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph-space2">By 1993, US troops were deeply involved in trying to end Somalia’s complicated and violent civil war involving competing warlords and clans. Because of the deeply fractured nature of the country at the time, the US mission was a daunting task without a clear goal. American strategy involved deploying American Special Forces, or Army Rangers, on raids to capture key members of the various factions that were causing the most strife and conflict, with particular focus on the Somali National Alliance (SNA), a group organized under the warlord Mohamed Aidid. Due to American technological superiority, many of these raids were very successful, increasing US confidence.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In October of 1993, US forces received intelligence that some of Aidid’s top officials would be gathering at a hotel in the heart of the capital city of Mogadishu, which was also deep in Aidid’s territory. Military leaders planned a raid to seize the officials, thereby delivering a severe blow to the SNA. The mission, known as the Battle of Mogadishu, or&mdash;more popularly&mdash;as Black Hawk Down, did not go as planned. Rather than quickly extract their targets, the Rangers were bogged down by gunfire on the streets, and the two Black Hawk helicopters providing support were shot down, turning the mission into an unplanned search and rescue as the Rangers attempted to save the crew of the helicopters. While the mission was ultimately successful in obtaining its targets, it was a strategic failure that resulted in significant Somali and American loss of life and a swell of opposition to the overall mission in Somalia at home.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The disintegration of the mission shocked military leaders at the time and highlighted a significantly flawed approach to urban warfare. Previous American raids had been successful for three primary reasons: (1) they occurred in more remote locations, (2) they occurred under the cover of night, and (3) they utilized the element of surprise by maximizing American technological superiority. The first two factors were altered in the Battle of Mogadishu simply by circumstance: the leaders were meeting in the center of a densely populated area in the middle of the day. While that could not be avoided, neither the mission planners nor the Rangers adequately planned for these changes. The Rangers assumed the mission would be quick, like others had been, and lightened their equipment loads, leaving behind water and night-vision goggles. The mission planners did not realize that a daylight mission in the heart of Aidid’s territory would be significantly more complicated, and so they did not allow sufficient flexibility for the commander, nor did they provide sufficient contingencies.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Most significantly, though, US officials overestimated the advantage their technology provided. First, American overconfidence resulted in little attempt at secrecy in planning. American forces were based out of the airport, giving many Somali contractors regular access to American plans, which were then leaked to the SNA. They were prepared for the American raid before it ever began. Also, while American helicopters provided stealth and speed, they also became the Rangers’ downfall.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The SNA studied American tactical patterns and adjusted their own strategies accordingly. For example, they knew that the US would use the helicopters for air support during the raid, so Aidid stationed surface-to-air missiles. They also knew that American policy was to rescue the helicopter crew once it was downed, which gave the SNA the tactical advantage. Because of the fluid and unofficial nature of factions in Somalia, friends and foes were not clearly labeled, allowing SNA fighters to easily blend in and out of the densely packed city. The SNA had the objective of crippling US forces with little regard to collateral loss of life, whereas they knew American policy would be to minimize civilian deaths. This became increasingly difficult as plain-clothed SNA fighters made it hard to tell combatant from civilian.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">When the images of the dead were broadcast back home, public outrage ultimately led to American withdrawal from Somalia altogether and to the country’s descent into deeper chaos. American officials were very reluctant to commit US troops to future humanitarian missions, resulting in a reorientation of American foreign policy. Tactically, the Battle of Mogadishu awoke military officials to the deep complexities of urban warfare and led to increased focus on improving information gathering, developing ways of observing targets from a safe distance, and creating more flexible and thorough plans for urban missions. It also was a significant motivation for the development of the US military drone program. However, the true lasting message is that there is no surefire way to be successful in urban warfare, and the tools that make the United States so powerful can sometimes lead to its downfall.</p>

Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality, we may at any time resolve upon, to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice? </p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph-space2">Skin coloration and markings have an important role to play in the world of snakes. Those intricate diamonds, stripes, and swirls help the animals hide from predators, but perhaps most importantly (for us humans, anyway), the markings can also indicate whether the snake is venomous. While it might seem counterintuitive for a venomous snake to stand out in bright red or blue, that fancy costume tells any nearby predator that approaching him would be a bad idea.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">If you see a flashy-looking snake in the woods, though, those markings don’t necessarily mean it’s venomous: some snakes have found a way to ward off predators without the actual venom. The scarlet kingsnake, for example, has very similar markings to the venomous coral snake with whom it frequently shares a habitat. However, the kingsnake is actually nonvenomous; it’s merely pretending to be dangerous to eat. A predatory hawk or eagle, usually hunting from high in the sky, can’t tell the difference between the two species, and so the kingsnake gets passed over and lives another day.</p>

			<p class="body_text_first-paragraph-space2">Hand washing is one of our simplest and most powerful weapons against infection. The idea behind hand washing is deceptively simple. Many illnesses are spread when people touch infected surfaces, such as door handles or other people’s hands, and then touch their own eyes, mouths, or noses. So, if pathogens can be removed from the hands before they spread, infections can be prevented. When done correctly, hand washing can prevent the spread of many dangerous bacteria and viruses, including those that cause the flu, the common cold, diarrhea, and many acute respiratory illnesses.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">The most basic method of hand washing involves only soap and water. Just twenty seconds of scrubbing with soap and a complete rinsing with water is enough to kill and/or wash away many pathogens. The process doesn’t even require warm water&mdash;studies have shown that cold water is just as effective at reducing the number of microbes on the hands. Antibacterial soaps are also available, although several studies have shown that simple soap and cold water are just as effective.</p>
			<p class="body_text_body_copy">In recent years, hand sanitizers have become popular as an alternative to hand washing. These gels, liquids, and foams contain a high concentration of alcohol (usually at least 60 percent) that kills most bacteria and fungi; they can also be effective against some, but not all, viruses. There is a downside to hand sanitizer, however. Because the sanitizer isn’t rinsed from hands, it only kills pathogens and does nothing to remove organic matter. So, hands “cleaned” with hand sanitizer may still harbor pathogens. Thus, while hand sanitizer can be helpful in situations where soap and clean water aren’t available, a simple hand washing is still the best option.</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. The passage does not discuss past wars in urban settings, only US raid tactics.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The author states that civilian deaths were high because combatants were able to move in and out of the general population easily because of the density. Advanced technology is not mentioned as an issue. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(D) is correct.</span> The passage states that “deep complexities of urban warfare . . . led to increased focus on improving information gathering, developing ways of observing targets from a safe distance, and creating more flexible and thorough plans for urban missions.” </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The passage describes the difficulty of keeping military secrets in Mogadishu because of the base of operations at the airport.</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">13.	(D)</span></p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(A) is incorrect. Washington emphasizes that his argument is “not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements... [L]et those engagements be observed in their genuine sense.” He argues that America should avoid future entanglements but indicates that the country should not break from its existing relationships. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. Washington states, ”It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it[...]”</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. This answer choice does not fit in the context of the sentence. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. Washington’s use of the description “the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships and enmities” suggests that European politics are regularly fluctuating, not just mutating in the current moment.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. Washington’s description of European politics indicates that they are fluctuating, not remaining stagnant. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. Washington does not allude to rules or laws in European politics. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">15.	(A)</span></p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(A) is correct.</span> The passage indicates that snakes’ “intricate diamonds, stripes, and swirls help the animals hide from predators, but perhaps most importantly (for us humans, anyway), the markings can also indicate whether the snake is venomous.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. Though the author does mention one difference between the kingsnake and the coral snake, this is not the primary purpose of the passage. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The author does not indicate why snakes are dangerous, only that some of them are. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. Though the author does provide some examples of this, this answer choice is more general, while the passage focused on snakes in particular. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. While the author may be contradicting readers’ understanding of the species, this is not the primary purpose of the passage.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">16.	(B)</span></p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(A) is incorrect. The author mentions that “the kingsnake is actually nonvenomous” but provides no more information about whether the kingsnake poses a danger to humans. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(B) is correct.</span> The final paragraph of the passage states that the two species “frequently [share] a habitat” and that “[a] predatory hawk or eagle, usually hunting from high in the sky, can’t tell the difference between the two species, and so the kingsnake gets passed over and lives another day.” </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The author does not imply that it is easy to tell the difference between venomous and nonvenomous snakes, only that it is possible. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The final paragraph states that the kingsnake “has very similar marking to the venomous coral snake” and does not indicate that these markings change with circumstances. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The author mentions that “the kingsnake is actually nonvenomous” but provides no more information about whether the kingsnake poses a danger to humans. </p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. The second paragraph states that “[t]he scarlet kingsnake, for example, has very similar markings to the venomous coral snake with whom it frequently shares a habitat.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(C) is correct.</span> The first paragraph states that “[w]hile it might seem counterintuitive for a venomous snake to stand out in bright red or blue, that fancy costume tells any nearby predator that approaching him would be a bad idea.” The coral snake’s markings do not allow it to hide from predators but rather to “ward [them] off[.]”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The second paragraph states that “the kingsnake is actually nonvenomous; it’s merely pretending to be dangerous to eat.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The first paragraph states that snakes’ “intricate diamonds, stripes, and swirls help the animals hide from predators[.]”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">18.	(A)</span></p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(A) is correct.</span> The passage states that “intricate diamonds, stripes, and swirls help the animals hide from predators[,]” implying that these markings are complex enough to allow the animals to blend in with their surroundings. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. The passage indicates that colorful markings do not allow the animals to hide but rather to ward off predators, so the word <span class="italic">colorful</span> does not apply in the context of the sentence. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. This answer choice does not fit in the context of the sentence, as the animals do not choose their markings. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The author does not suggest that animals’ markings are changeable. </p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(A) is incorrect. The author includes nothing to suggest that hand sanitizer disguises pathogens. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. The author includes nothing to suggest that hand sanitizer hides pathogens. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The author notes that while hand sanitizer kills most of the bacteria on the surface of the hands, it “does nothing to remove organic matter” from them. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(D) is correct.</span> The author writes that “hands ‘cleaned’ with hand sanitizer may still harbor pathogens” because sanitizer “does nothing to remove organic matter” from the hands. The bacteria are not completely washed off, and therefore some are able to continue living on the surface of the hands. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The author includes nothing to suggest that hand sanitizer breeds pathogens. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">21.	(B)</span></p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(A) is incorrect. In the first paragraph, the author writes, “Many illnesses are spread when people touch infected surfaces, such as door handles or other people’s hands, and then touch their own eyes, mouths, or noses.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(B) is correct.</span> In the second paragraph, the author writes, “The [hand washing] process doesn’t even require warm water&mdash;studies have shown that cold water is just as effective at reducing the number of microbes on the hands. Antibacterial soaps are also available, although several studies have shown that simple soap and cold water is just as effective.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. In the third paragraph, the author writes, “These gels, liquids, and foams contain a high concentration of alcohol (usually at least 60 percent) that kills most bacteria and fungi; they can also be effective against some, but not all, viruses.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. In the final paragraph, the author writes, “Thus, while hand sanitizer can be helpful in situations where soap and clean water aren’t available, a simple hand washing is still the best option.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. In the third paragraph, the author writes, “There is a downside to hand sanitizer, however. Because the sanitizer isn’t rinsed from hands, it only kills pathogens and does nothing to remove organic matter. So, hands ‘cleaned’ with hand sanitizer may still harbor pathogens.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">22.	(B)</span></p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(A) is incorrect. The author includes nothing to suggest that water has antibacterial properties. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text"><span class="bold">(B) is correct.</span> The author writes that because hand sanitizer “isn’t rinsed from hands [as is water], it only kills pathogens and does nothing to remove organic matter.”</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The author writes, “The [hand washing] process doesn’t even require warm water&mdash;studies have shown that cold water is just as effective at reducing the number of microbes on the hands. Antibacterial soaps are also available, although several studies have shown that simple soap and cold water are just as effective.” This implies that the temperature of the water is unrelated to its effectiveness.</p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The author indicates that the temperature of the water is unrelated to its effectiveness (see C above). </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The passage does not discuss hydrating the skin.</p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. In the final paragraph, the author writes, “Thus, while hand sanitizer can be helpful in situations where soap and clean water aren’t available, a simple hand washing is still the best option.” The author acknowledges that hand sanitizer is a viable option when soap and water are unavailable. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. Though the author lists a few of the diseases that are spread through daily interaction “including ... the flu, the common cold, diarrhea, and many acute respiratory illnesses[,]” she does not  explain any further. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. While the author does explain how hand washing and hand sanitizer are effective, her goal is not just to describe hand washing, but rather to convince readers of its importance. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The author writes, “Antibacterial soaps are also available, although several studies have shown that simple soap and cold water are just as effective[,]” but this is the extent of her comment on antibacterial soaps; she does not take a particular stance against them or tell readers not to purchase them. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_number"><span class="bold">25.	(A)</span></p>

			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(B) is incorrect. The author says that “[m]any illnesses are spread” when people touch their “eyes, mouths, and noses[,]” but not all illnesses; thus the reader can infer that hand washing is not solely for people who touch their faces. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(C) is incorrect. The author says that “while hand sanitizer can be helpful in situations where soap and clean water aren’t available, a simple hand washing is still the best option.” Thus, hand sanitizer should be not used instead of hand washing altogether, but it does effectively serve its purpose as an alternative when soap and water are not available. </p>
			<p class="sample_questions_answer_key_answer_text">(D) is incorrect. The author indicates that hand sanitizer will not replace hand washing altogether because it “does nothing to remove organic matter” from hands after use. Thus, “hands ‘cleaned’ with hand sanitizer may still harbor pathogens.”</p>
			<p class="answer_key_answer_text">(E) is incorrect. The author writes that “if pathogens can be removed from the hands before they spread, infections can be prevented.” This implies that healthy people should wash their hands as well to prevent the spread of disease from surfaces they have touched.</p><div class="calibre2"></div>
