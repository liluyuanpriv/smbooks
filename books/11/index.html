<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2461" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">C</span>ollected in these two volumes are essays published during the past five decades, on various aspects of Chinese cultural and intellectual traditions and their modern transformations. Written on different occasions and in different times, they are scattered in a great variety of publications, some obscure and out of print. However, since all of them possess, to a greater or lesser degree, a unity of theme regarding the Chinese tradition in its historical changes, I consider it desirable to make them accessible to the general reading public by way of reprinting in a collected form.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It is my extraordinary fortune that two of my highly esteemed colleagues, Professors Josephine Chiu-Duke and Michael S. Duke, agreed to serve as editors of my two volumes. They have edited each and every one of my essays with meticulous and diligent care, resulting in the elimination of a great deal of imperfections in the original versions. I am particularly grateful to both of them for providing, in the “Editorial Note,” a lucid account of my views discussed in these essays. It is also remarkable that instead of taking my views in the English essays as a self-contained category, they have made every effort to understand them in the context of my published oeuvre as a whole and specifically emphasized their interrelatedness to my Chinese writings.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2462" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In this connection, a word may be said about my bilingual historical writings. Generally speaking, since the 1970s, it has been an established practice on my part to write book-length monographic studies in Chinese and present these findings in a more concise format in English as articles in journals, periodicals, or symposia. The difference is more than between a longer and a shorter version, however; it also has something to do with two different ways of historical representation. Full documentation is often emphasized in Chinese historical writings&mdash;traditional and modern&mdash;as a positive feature. As a result, direct quotation of original sources has been established as a common historical method. On the other hand, I deeply appreciate the Western style of argumentation in historical studies that, more often than not, refrains from extensive quotation of sources. Thus, in writing bilingually, I often secretly wished that my two versions might somehow strengthen and supplement, as well as complement, each other.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>I wish to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to Professor David Der-wei Wang for his kindness and, indeed, patience in including these two volumes of mine in a series of books he has specifically designed for Columbia University Press. I also wish to thank all of the various presses for generously granting their respective permissions to reprint my essays, Mr. Jeff S. Heller of Princeton’s East Asian Studies Department for conveying materials back and forth to the editors, and Ms. Su Hue Kim for her years of preparing my many drafts into typed form.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>I dedicate these two volumes to my wife, Monica Shu-ping Chen Yü, whose abiding love and support have sustained me throughout my career.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1272" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">P</span>rofessor Yü Ying-shih is a leading scholar in the field of Chinese studies. He was awarded the John W. Kluge Prize in 2006 for achievement in the Study of Humanity, and in September 2014, he also received the first Tang Prize international award in Sinology. As an eminent historian and a conscientious intellectual, Professor Yü has dedicated more than sixty years of his life to the study of Chinese history, thought, politics, and culture,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1420" id="calibre_link-1436" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> crossing “many disciplines, time periods and issues, examining in a profound way major questions and deeper truths about human nature.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1421" id="calibre_link-1437" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> Through this comprehensive and integrative lifetime study, Professor Yü has published some thirty books, forty-one monographs, and more than five hundred articles and essays.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1422" id="calibre_link-1438" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> At the same time, he has redefined the Chinese intellectual and cultural tradition, excavated the meaning of and instilled new life into that tradition, and, above all, has persistently put his intellectual convictions into practice without worrying about acting “against the current.” Such actions are evident in his scholarly articles analyzing, for example, the problematic nature of a “new wave of Chinese nationalism,” and of “the study of history” based on Chinese official orthodoxy of “the Marxist-Stalinist five-stage formulation.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1423" id="calibre_link-1439" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup> They are also apparent in his “outspoken criticism” of the Chinese government’s suppression of the peaceful 1989 Tiananmen demonstration, his support for many scholars, young students, and liberal-minded intellectuals who left China after 1989, and his ongoing regular commentary on China’s social, intellectual, and political phenomena for Radio Free Asia.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1424" id="calibre_link-1440" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1362" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Professor Yü exerted himself to complete a major revision of the article on Wang Yangming (1472&ndash;1529) in late 2014, but his health has prevented him from writing an introduction to these two volumes, and his deep modesty would also not permit us to use his address on receiving the Kluge Prize and his Tang Prize in Sinology acceptance speech as a comprehensive introduction. Thus, at the risk of not doing full justice to the breadth and depth of his creative contribution to the field of Chinese studies, we feel it necessary to offer a few initial observations on the primary concerns that have emerged in his research on China’s cultural and intellectual tradition, while also explaining the structure of this book of essays.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Since Professor Yü left China in the beginning of 1950 and enrolled in the first class of the then newly established New Asia College in Hong Kong, two questions have always dominated his intellectual consciousness: As an ancient civilization, what was China’s essential value system that had sustained the life of its culture through ages of tumultuous political changes? Furthermore, would this system survive its modern revolutionary overhaul and find its way to secure itself as a culture that has historically displayed “a great deal of overlapping consensus in basic values” with the mainstream of Western culture?<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1425" id="calibre_link-1441" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> In a way, these two questions are tied to his overall concern about where China would go after the radical transformation of its 1949 revolution. The rich body of his decades of research that started during his college days in Hong Kong and continued throughout his academic life at the universities of Michigan, Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, and especially the work he carried out during the time after he retired from Princeton in 2001, reflects his examinations of and responses to these key questions.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the summer of 1971, when he revisited his alma mater and took his first trip to the major research institutes in Japan and Taipei, Professor Yü discovered that almost all of the China specialists there had never read his book or articles published in English. At the time, he began to think that if he wanted to play a role in bringing about meaningful communication between the Western and East Asian intellectual communities, he probably should try to make his research available in the Chinese-language world. Later, between 1973 and 1975, he took a leave from Harvard and returned to Hong Kong to serve as president of the New Asia College, and concurrently as the pro-vice-chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Due to the demands of his daily work, Chinese became the most natural and reasonable medium for his writing. It was then that he decided he would resume writing large and detailed research articles and books in Chinese, and would present similar topics on a smaller scale and in a more concise format in English.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1426" id="calibre_link-1442" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1115" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As a result of that decision, his works in English constitute only a small part of his vast publication record, but the thirty-three scholarly articles collected in these two volumes nevertheless represent the essence of his fundamental concerns about and systematic interpretations of Chinese culture and history ranging over a time span of more than two thousand years. They demonstrate how his extraordinary knowledge about a wide variety of primary sources enabled him to investigate the crucial changes in Chinese cultural and intellectual traditions during the major transitions of China’s history. They also show how he has always explored and approached a series of questions and issues centering on his concerns from both diachronic and synchronic perspectives while never failing to compare important aspects of Chinese culture with relevant historical phenomena in Western or other Asian cultures. More important, they reveal the complex changes crisscrossing with the unbroken line of the foundational values that have connected China’s past and present, and probably its future as well. We should also note that several of Professor Yü’s Chinese books, especially his magnum opus on the historical world of Zhu Xi (1130&ndash;1200) <span>朱</span><span>熹</span><span>的</span><span>歷</span><span>史</span><span>世</span><span>界</span>: <span>宋</span><span>代</span><span>士</span><span>大</span><span>夫</span><span>政</span><span>治</span><span>文</span><span>化</span><span>的</span><span>研</span><span>究</span> (<i class="calibre9">Zhu Xi de lishi shijie: Songdai shidafu zhengzhi wenhua de yanjiu</i> [The Historical World of Zhu Xi: A Study of the Political Culture of Song Intellectuals]) (Taipei: Yunchen, 2003; Beijing: Sanlian, 2011), and his most recent breakthrough study, <span>論</span><span>天</span><span>人</span><span>之</span><span>際</span>: <span>中</span><span>國</span><span>古</span><span>代</span><span>思</span><span>想</span><span>起</span><span>源</span><span>試</span><span>探</span> (<i class="calibre9">Lun tianren zhiji: Zhongguo gudai sixiang qiyuan shi tan</i> [Between Heaven and Man: An Exploration of the Origin of Ancient Chinese Thought]) (Taipei: Linking Publishing, 2014), have developed from some of the articles presented here.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1427" id="calibre_link-1443" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The earliest article in these two volumes was published in 1965 and the most recent one was completed near the end of 2014. For the present volumes, these articles are not arranged by their publication dates, but rather in chronological sequence by Chinese dynasties and with respect to their interconnected nature. In this manner, the central theme of continuity and transformation that links these articles together in relation to Professor Yü’s overall investigation and interpretation of Chinese civilization may unfold in accordance with its own inner logic.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1239" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In his 2006 John W. Kluge Prize acceptance speech, Professor Yü asserts, “the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, or the Way, and history constitute the inside and outside of Chinese civilization.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1428" id="calibre_link-1444" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> Indeed, unraveling the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals’ discourse on the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> <span>道</span> and their criticism of contemporary reality in different periods of time throughout China’s historical trajectory has always been ingrained in Professor Yü’s intellectual efforts. This endeavor is explicitly manifest in his earlier studies of the tension-fraught ruler-minister relationship embedded in Chinese political tradition. These studies had a strong, “wide and enduring” influence, and like many of his later works, have since become classic essays for students of Chinese history and culture in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even in China after Mao.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1429" id="calibre_link-1445" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> Professor Yü’s endeavor is equally discernible in his nonpareil study of the post-1949 inner landscape of the late historian Chen Yinque (1890&ndash;1969).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1430" id="calibre_link-1446" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> Its impact has been and continues to be far-reaching. It caused quite a bit of consternation to the Chinese official academic leadership, and gave rise to an extensive trend of studying Chen Yinque’s works among different generations of Chinese scholars during the past three decades.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1431" id="calibre_link-1447" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> Likewise, one can also detect Professor Yü’s efforts in the above-mentioned trailblazing masterpieces on Zhu Xi and <i class="calibre9">Between Heaven and Man</i> centering on the formation and development of China’s reflexive system of knowledge and thought on the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, or if one may, the transcendentally rooted set of moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, throughout what Karl Jaspers called the “Axial Age.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>We believe that the articles made available here on the intellectual and cultural changes from ancient times down to the late nineteenth century can help illustrate just exactly how and why the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, according to Professor Yü, became the defining characteristic of Chinese culture during the “Axial Age,” and how it was upheld by some of the finest Chinese intellectuals throughout traditional Chinese history as a critical standard in their striving for an ideal world order vis-à-vis their harsh political reality. These works should also serve to reveal just how the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> was reformulated, expanded, defended, and preserved by these intellectuals generation after generation so that the lifeline of Chinese culture could continue on even though the individual political regimes perished in the flow of Chinese history. It is the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, then, as Professor Yü argues, that ultimately sustained these intellectuals to keep their faith in their cultural tradition and to take a stand during the dark moments of Chinese history.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The noble efforts of these intellectuals undoubtedly command our respect, but on a closer reading of Professor Yü’s work, one may find that they actually impel us further to see how the Chinese intellectual striving for the realization of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> never actually secured an environment in which their struggles would no longer be vulnerable to the abuses of arbitrary power. Thus, one will also find that this tragic side of the Chinese intellectual tradition comprises another underlying theme that is embodied in Professor Yü’s articles and is even more prominent and prevalent in his comprehensive lifelong project on that tradition. In this light, one may be justified in viewing this portrayal of the parallel yet crisscrossing relations between these two themes not only as a major vehicle to illustrate the crucial continuity and changes that surfaced in China’s own tradition, but also as reflecting the critical tension between the <i class="calibre9">daotong</i> <span>道</span><span>統</span>, or the tradition of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, and the <i class="calibre9">zhengtong</i> <span>政</span><span>統</span>, or the tradition of political power, throughout Chinese history. This tension is clearly notable in Professor Yü’s perceptive analysis of Wang Yangming’s “reorientation” and his Confucian efforts to enlighten the ordinary Chinese people, specifically including the traditionally denigrated merchant class, so that they could realize the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in their daily lives. Although this “reorientation” was an innovative reinterpretation and expansion of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, the tragic side of the Confucian intellectual tradition remained unchanged.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1208" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It is from that perspective, we believe, that Professor Yü has, since 1951, and distinctly since the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations, persistently discussed why it is necessary for China to resume its nineteenth-century path toward the establishment of constitutional democracy so that the century-long intellectual struggle for a free, just, and civilized China will have a real chance to take root in Chinese soil. Discussion of these issues, with China’s tortuous path to modernity as a presupposed historical background, is one of the main focuses of the second volume.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>On one reading, these two volumes can be viewed as a complex tapestry into which all of the articles weave together the penetrative explorations and insights that shape Professor Yü’s portrait of China as a coherent whole. On the other hand, they can also be seen as two independent units, with one focusing on the continuities and ruptures in China’s traditional intellectual and cultural history, and one concentrating on the transformations of Chinese traditions in modern times. As Professor Yü’s articles illustrate, however, tradition always finds its way back into modernity in a dialectically entangled manner, whether in Chinese intellectuals’ narrative search to delineate China’s place in the modern world, or in their new conceptualization of how to write Chinese history.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>One perhaps may question how Han Chinese ideas of the afterlife and their food or elite seating orders, or even the fictional world of China’s greatest Qing dynasty novel, <i class="calibre9">Honglou meng</i> (Dream of the Red Chamber), are related to the central themes of Professor Yü’s two volumes. When one reads these articles, one is likely to marvel that China’s age-old practice of linking the seating order with a person’s seniority, or his or her social, political, and economic status, can, in fact, trace its roots at least to as early as the third century <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.,</small> but it is even more pertinent to note that this seemingly innocuous cultural practice of seating orders actually played a decisive role in the subsequent development of Chinese imperial history in its initial stage. In short, a certain cultural custom may be just as important as historical contingency in shaping the direction of one’s destiny, be it for an individual, or for an empire.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>At the same time, the way that Han Chinese transformed their indigenous culinary arts by creatively incorporating foreign foods and cooking methods into their own cuisine certainly demonstrates the adaptability, as well as the tenacity, of Chinese tradition. The enduring nature of Chinese tradition is also obvious in Professor Yü’s article on the afterlife. It shows that the Han Chinese perception of the worlds between the living and the dead were quite similar to the earlier Chinese conceptualization of the relationship between the transcendental or the ideal world symbolized by the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> and the earthly reality in the sense that the two worlds were never perceived as two mutually exclusive realms, nor were they seen as two identical ones either. Furthermore, it also shows that the Han Chinese concepts of life and death were an “extension” of their integrative worldview of the human, Heaven, and Earth as comprising an inseparable unity that was sustained by the ever-so-close yet ever-so-distant <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1432" id="calibre_link-1448" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2463" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The same thing can be said about the article on the <i class="calibre9">Dream of the Red Chamber</i> in volume 2. The difference is that Professor Yü’s discussion of the two interconnected worlds in this Qing novel, the ideal world and the world of reality, and the irreversible collapse of the ideal world did not evoke too much of a lament for this lost paradise. It did, however, lead us to place this article after the one that gives an intricate synopsis of Qing Confucianism as a whole. The collapse of a fictional world thus serves as a symbolic parallel to the final disintegration of the traditional Chinese imperial order and foreshadows the coming “radicalization of China in the twentieth century.”</span></div>
<div class="noindent1"><span>All these articles were originally selected by Professor Yü and sent to Ms. Leslie Kriesel at Columbia University Press some years ago. They were intended for an important project on distinguished scholars of Chinese studies organized by Professor David Der-wei Wang. Ms. Kriesel had them formatted as Word files, proofread them, and sent them to Professor Yü for review, but he was unable to attend to them due to his medical condition. In October 2014, when Professor Wang asked us whether we could help complete the editorial work, we had no doubt that this meaningful project should be completed.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>During the complicated process of reformatting, many passages and sections in the original articles, as well as all the Chinese characters, were lost. We have, where possible, retrieved the original English versions in books or from journals, located Chinese originals of essays translated into English and Chinese translations of English versions, restored the missing passages and sections, and changed all of the Wade-Giles romanizations of Chinese names and terms to contemporary Pinyin romanization.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1433" id="calibre_link-1449" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> In the process, Chinese characters were reentered and additional Chinese characters were supplied for clarity in several essays.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Meanwhile, English translations of most Chinese book titles mentioned in the text (but not in the endnotes) are also provided. At first mention in the main text, for example, we have <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i> <span>易</span><span>經</span> (Classic of Changes), but only <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i> in the endnotes. Our other editorial tasks included standardizing the endnoting format, entering new notes for several published speeches that were not endnoted, adding notes to citations not referenced in some places, and shortening all notes by means of abbreviations of frequently cited titles. Names well known in the English-speaking world or used by Chinese scholars active in English are given in their familiar way, such as Chiang Kai-shek, Fung Yu-lan, Hu Shih, Lien-sheng Yang, Sun Yat-sen, and Ying-shih Yü. In Chinese references, however, such names are given as Feng Youlan, Hu Shi, Yang Liansheng, Yü Ying-shih, etc. As an example: Ying-shih Yü, <i class="calibre9">Trade and Expansion in Han China</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), but Yü Ying-shih <span>余</span><span>英</span><span>時</span>, <i class="calibre9">Lishi yu sixiang</i> <span>歷</span><span>史</span><span>與</span><span>思</span><span>想</span> (Taipei: Lianjing, 1976).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2464" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>With Professor Yü’s permission, we made a few minor changes in some of the Chinese-to-English translations and changed a small number of other wordings. Professor Yü’s two scholarly prize acceptance speeches mentioned above are in an appendix per his insistence, but we suggest that one read them as an introduction to his multifaceted and multilayered but integrated narrative world. In these speeches, one finds that while his narratives explore the unique characteristics of Chinese culture, they simultaneously illustrate how this uniqueness is inherently universal in its honoring of “common humanity and human dignity” as the core values of Chinese culture.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To understand Professor Yü’s lifetime contribution to the Chinese intellectual and cultural tradition, one of course has to become familiar with his entire oeuvre, above all, his extensive publications in Chinese. However, editing these articles has made us increasingly aware of why and how Professor Yü has been “hailed as the greatest Chinese intellectual historian of his generation,” “a paradigm for [Chinese] humanism,” and “the epitome of a traditional Chinese <i class="calibre9">shi</i>-intellectual”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1434" id="calibre_link-1450" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> who never gives up his efforts to ameliorate social ills and improve public well-being, whether through words or actions. That various “Yü Ying-shih fan clubs” (<i class="calibre9">Yü Ying-shih fensi tuan</i> <span>余</span><span>英</span><span>時</span><span>粉</span><span>絲</span><span>團</span>) have emerged among the general reading public in the Chinese-language world no doubt provides further endorsement of the above tributes to him, and they may just further serve to indicate the unusual nature of both his work and his actions.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1435" id="calibre_link-1451" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup> These “fans” among the reading public most likely also hold what they learn from Professor Yü’s works to represent what the Chinese cultural and intellectual tradition genuinely stands for, and thus would likely agree that his contribution is not only significant for the field of Chinese studies but is also relevant to anyone who believes in the shared values of the best humane traditions, be they Chinese or Western, in today’s world community.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In conclusion to this note, we would like to thank Professor David Der-wei Wang for arranging this editorial work. At Columbia University Press, we also thank Ms. Leslie Kriesel for all her preliminary work on these essays, editorial assistant Jonathan Fiedler, and the final copyeditors, Sue Sakai and John Donohue of Westchester Publishing Services. Further thanks are due to Professor Chin-shing Huang, director of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica in Taiwan, and his able assistant Ms. Yaling Lee for providing Professor Yü’s revised and expanded article on Wang Yangming. We also wish to express our gratitude to Dr. Jiu-jung Lo of the Institute of Modern History of the Academia Sinica and Ms. Liu Jing of the Asian Library at the University of British Columbia, who helped us locate information on old journal articles.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Last, but most important, we want to thank Professor Yü for trusting us with this worthy project and for assisting us throughout. Our deep gratitude goes equally to Mrs. Monica Yü, or Chen Shuping, for her encouragement and support. Without Professor Yü’s warm and kind understanding, which helped our work proceed smoothly, and his providing us with some hard-to-find documents, we could not possibly have brought this project to its completion within the intended time limit. It goes without saying that any errors that may have occurred in the process are ours alone.</span></div>

The consternation of the Chinese official academic leadership occurred twice and lasted quite a while each time. The first refers to the reaction of the then official leadership to Professor Yü’s 1958 study of Chen Yinque’s work on <i class="calibre9">Zaisheng yuan</i> <span>再</span><span>生</span><span>緣</span>, an eighteenth-century <i class="calibre9">Tanci</i> ballad (<i class="calibre9">Tanci</i> is a popular form of singing accompanied by instrumental music), and it involved the top security official Kang Sheng <span>康</span><span>生</span> and scholars such as Guo Moruo <span>郭</span><span>沫</span><span>若</span>, serving at the time as the head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The second refers to Chinese official responses to a series of Professor Yü’s articles discussing Chen Yinque’s inner landscape published in 1983 and 1984 (later reworked into his 1984 book on Chen). This time, Hu Qiaomu <span>胡</span><span>喬</span><span>木</span>, the head of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences was involved.

<div class="footnote-i"><span>Hao Chang (Zhang Hao <span>張</span><span>灝</span>) made a similar comment describing Professor Yü as a “public intellectual” for the Hong Kong television documentary series on “Jiechu Huaren <span>傑</span><span>出</span><span>華</span><span>人</span>,” or “outstanding Chinese.” The program on Professor Yü was produced by the late Mr. Weng Zhiyu (1968&ndash;2015) <span>翁</span><span>志</span><span>羽</span> and aired on January 6, 2008.

It sticks together in a ball (<i class="calibre9">tuan</i>) and is difficult to separate; thus, <i class="calibre9">fensi tuan</i> also symbolizes the solidarity of such fans. We have found from 16,800 to 85,200 results when we googled “Yü Ying-shih fensi tuan” in Chinese several times in July 2015.</span></div>

Some Preliminary Observations on the Rise of Qing Confucian Intellectualism</span></a></span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><span class="dropcap">T</span>his is a thoroughly revised and much expanded version of a paper first drafted in 1971. Since it was originally intended to serve as an introduction to my book-length study, tentatively entitled <i class="calibre9">The Rise of Confucian Intellectualism in the Qing</i>, with it, I tried to cover rather than dig the ground. In rewriting this paper, I have still followed my original plan by avoiding, as much as possible, factual details. The central task I set for myself was to formulate certain conceptual schemes in light of which the internal development of Neo-Confucianism from the Song to the Qing may be looked at anew and, it is hoped, with fruitfulness. Some of the points of view suggested here have been more fully developed in several separate studies of mine that deal with various specific aspects of the intellectual history of this period. However, I now wish to present my preliminary observations on this vast and complicated subject with the hope that criticisms and comments from colleagues will help my whole projected study reach its final form sooner.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">THE PROBLEM</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1262" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the West, there has been a deep-rooted conflict between faith and reason. In the Christian tradition, the conflict has centered more specifically around a faith versus learning controversy. The New Testament actually presents Jesus in two different images. On the one hand, Jesus sees learning as an obstacle to Christian piety. Later, this became the source of the stream of anti-intellectualism within the Church. On the other hand, Jesus also appears in the New Testament as a man of profound learning, that is, a scholar of the Scriptures, on the basis of which scholarship has been justified as a Christian calling by those who have sought to combine faith with reason.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1822" id="calibre_link-1943" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> Generally speaking, however, until the so-called Revival of Learning in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, faith far outweighed reason on the Christian scale. In its extreme form, Christian anti-intellectualism may be found in the well-known denunciation of classical pagan culture by Tertullian (ca. 190&ndash;240), who said: “What has Athens to do with Jerusalem, the Academy with the Church? We have no need for curiosity since the Evangel.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1823" id="calibre_link-1944" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Historically, the conflict between faith and reason in medieval Christianity may be taken, to a large extent, to be a result of the struggle for domination between the Hebraic-Christian religious tradition on the one hand and the Greco-Roman classical culture on the other hand. Several centuries elapsed before the terrain between revealed truth and secular learning reached a state of compromise. In the persons of St. Jerome (347?&ndash;420) and St. Augustine (354&ndash;430), we first see the two prototypes of the Christian scholar: the former was a great scholar who was a Christian, whereas the latter was a great Christian who left an indelible mark on scholarship.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1824" id="calibre_link-1945" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> Thus, the love of learning and the desire for God, to borrow the well-known title of Jean Leclerq’s monograph, became two basic elements in medieval monastic culture. How to reconcile these two apparently conflicting values therefore posed a perplexing dilemma for every monk. As Leclercq neatly puts it:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>And if there is a problem, it is because the difficulty takes the shape of a tension between two elements whose reconciliation is always precarious and between which an equilibrium must be constantly established. There is always the risk of weighting the balance too heavily on one side or the other. These two elements are the two constants of Western monastic culture: on the one hand, the study of letters, on the other, the exclusive search for God, the love of eternal life and the consequent detachment from all else, including the study of letters…. There is no ideal synthesis which can be expressed in a speculative formula, as there might be if the solution were of the intellectual order; the conflict can be transcended only by raising it to spiritual order.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1825" id="calibre_link-1946" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1041" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Does a similar problem exist in Chinese intellectual history? The answer is yes, but with important qualifications. In contrast to the West, no such sharp opposition between faith and reason can be found in the Chinese case. As William de Bary has aptly remarked, “Confucian rationalism does not involve a conscious exaltation of reason as opposed to faith or intuitions (none of the early masters seems to have acknowledged such an explicit dichotomy).”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1826" id="calibre_link-1947" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup> Nevertheless, in early Confucianism, a central polarity can be discerned&mdash;the polarity between learning and speculative thinking.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1827" id="calibre_link-1948" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> Confucius once discussed the relationship between <i class="calibre9">xue</i> <span>學</span> (learning) and <i class="calibre9">si</i> <span>思</span> (thinking) in the following way: “Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1828" id="calibre_link-1949" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> Here learning and thinking are obviously taken as mutually complementary, neither functioning properly without the other. Sometimes, however, Confucius placed more emphasis on learning than on thinking: “I have been the whole day without eating, and the whole night without sleeping&mdash;occupied with thinking. It was of no use. The better plan is to learn.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1829" id="calibre_link-1950" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> These two statements taken together seem to mean that by learning Confucius meant to study in order to attain knowledge of things and by thinking he meant to speculate about things.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1830" id="calibre_link-1951" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> Both learning and thinking involve the exercise of the mind, but the mind operates at two different levels. In learning, the mind operates at the concrete or factual level, and the result is knowledge of things as they are. In speculative thinking, the mind operates at the abstract or theoretical level, and theorizing enables one to grasp the significance of things. Learning and thinking are necessarily of two different orders because in Confucius’s scheme of things, the former must precede the latter. It is by no means an accident that in terms of priority, “extensive learning” (<i class="calibre9">boxue</i> <span>博</span><span>學</span>) is placed before “careful thinking” (<i class="calibre9">shensi</i> <span>慎</span><span>思</span>) in the “Zhongyong” (Doctrine of the Mean).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1831" id="calibre_link-1952" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> Pure speculation is perilous because it lacks basis in factual knowledge in the first place. Nor would receptive learning always be fruitful, however. It is “labor lost” for the obvious reason that sheer erudition gets nowhere.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>There were times when Confucius talked as if he were among Isaiah Berlin’s hedgehogs, who “relate everything to a single central vision, one system less or more coherent or articulate, in terms of which they understand, think and feel&mdash;a single, universal, organizing principle in terms of which alone all that they are and say has significance.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1832" id="calibre_link-1953" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> A conversation Confucius had with his disciple Zigong <span>子</span><span>貢</span> (Duanmu Ci <span>端</span><span>木</span><span>賜</span>) illustrates this point: “The Master said, ‘Ci, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?’ Zigong replied: ‘Yes,&mdash;but perhaps it is not so?’ ‘No’ was the answer; ‘I seek a unity all-pervading.’ ”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1833" id="calibre_link-1954" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Here the emphasis is shifted to thinking. For the “all-pervading unity” (<i class="calibre9">yiguan</i> <span>一</span><span>貫</span>) can result only from speculative thinking or theorizing. In still another context, the Master also defined the polarity in terms of <i class="calibre9">bo</i> <span>博</span> (erudition) and <i class="calibre9">yue</i> <span>約</span> (essentialism): “By extensively studying the literature and getting to its essence in the light of <i class="calibre9">li</i> <span>禮</span> (rites), one may thus likewise not err from what is right.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1834" id="calibre_link-1955" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1251" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It is important to note that the term “essentialism,” expressed this way in the context of <i class="calibre9">li</i>, carries heavy moral connotations. And Confucius’s “all-pervading unity” must also be understood in this moral light. It is not systematic thinking or theorizing in the ordinary sense. It is, in fact, moralizing. Thus, in the final analysis, the Confucian polarity proves to be knowledge versus morality. This should occasion no surprise because in the Confucian frame of reference, knowledge should always serve a higher moral purpose.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>From the point of view of intellectual history, this polarity produced a lasting influence on the shaping of the Confucian tradition. Insofar as Confucius stressed extensive learning or erudition, he created the image of a scholar, and insofar as he emphasized the “all-pervading unity” or “essentialism,” he created the image of a thinker or philosopher. After Confucius, although learning and thinking were generally taken as two inseparably complementary aspects of the Confucian teaching, the individual emphasis of each Confucian often varied. Thus, Mencius, who more closely fits the mold of a Confucian thinker, stressed “essentialism” (<i class="calibre9">yue</i>) rather than “erudition” (<i class="calibre9">bo</i>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1835" id="calibre_link-1956" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> On the other hand, Xunzi, being more a scholar, attached a greater importance to learning than to thinking.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1836" id="calibre_link-1957" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>With the rise of Neo-Confucianism in the Song, the polarity became more clearly than ever before one between knowledge and morality. This polarization manifested itself in a variety of ways, old and new. Between the two major schools of Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan, it was seen as a controversy, respectively, over <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> <span>道</span><span>問</span><span>學</span> (following the path of inquiry and study) and <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> <span>尊</span><span>德</span><span>性</span> (honoring the moral nature). Zhu Xi once confessed that he had overstressed the role of inquiry and study just as Lu perhaps had overstressed that of moral nature.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1837" id="calibre_link-1958" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup> Lu, on the other hand, persistently held his view that it is pointless to pursue inquiry and study without honoring the moral nature in the first place.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1838" id="calibre_link-1959" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> Since the two key terms, <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> and <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>, occupy a central place in Neo-Confucianism and since we discern in these two broad comprehensive concepts a polarization between “morality” and “knowledge,” a word of explanation is in order so that a nonspecialist Western reader may make a better sense out of such English expressions as “honoring the moral nature” and “following the path of inquiry and study.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1009" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the Neo-Confucian context, <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> implies, above all, the awakening of moral faith through the understanding of our own nature, which partakes of the moral quality of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. As a result, we gain a kind of moral knowledge that more or less resembles the Christian “revealed truth.” <i class="calibre9">Dao wenxue</i>, on the other hand, deals with the whole territory of what we call objective knowledge, which ranges from knowledge of a Confucian classical text to that of a blade of grass. But the important question here is how do <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> and <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> stand in relation to each other? The answer differs sharply between an intellectualist such as Zhu Xi and an anti-intellectualist such as Lu Xiangshan. In a manner quite reminiscent of Thomas Aquinas, Zhu Xi thinks that he who knows anything knows something about <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. According to this view, then, knowledge obtained through <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> has a built-in moral quality, though the moral quality of such knowledge may vary greatly in degree from one case (say, knowledge of a Confucian classical text) to another (say, knowledge of a blade of grass). Moreover, total awakening of moral faith will arrive only at the end of a long painstaking process of “inquiry and study.” By contrast, Lu Xiangshan does not seem to have assigned any significant role to “inquiry and study” in man’s quest for <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. The awakening of moral faith cannot be brought about by knowledge accumulated through <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>, which is at best morally irrelevant. When the awakening takes place, it takes place as a “leap,” which is nonintellectual in character. To be fair to Lu Xiangshan, he does not repudiate “inquiry and study” altogether. Nevertheless, he does insist that only after having experienced the leap of moral faith can one then justifiably speak of “inquiry and study.” Without <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i>, <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> is like a ship without a rudder. Here Lu Xiangshan’s view is diametrically opposite to Zhu Xi’s conception that moral faith must build itself on a firm intellectual foundation. Polarization between morality and knowledge in Neo-Confucianism can be understood as having resulted mainly from the lasting conflict between these two opposing attitudes.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Within the Cheng-Zhu school, the polarity of morality and knowledge also found an expression characteristically its own. It took the form of an active tension between moral cultivation and the extension of knowledge, as best expressed in the formula “moral cultivation requires seriousness and the pursuit of learning depends on the extension of knowledge.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1839" id="calibre_link-1960" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> This reminds us analogously of the tension between learning and piety in the Christian tradition. Even Zhu Xi’s own intellectual career also shows traces of a lifelong inner struggle with this polarity. His extensive discussions of various Confucian polarities&mdash;such as <i class="calibre9">jujing</i> <span>居</span><span>敬</span> (exercising seriousness) and <i class="calibre9">qiongli</i> <span>窮</span><span>理</span> (thorough study of principles), moral cultivation and extension of knowledge, knowledge and action, and the “all-pervading unity” and “extensive learning”&mdash;all bear importantly on the basic problem of how to establish a balance between the moral element and the intellectual element on the Confucian scale.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1840" id="calibre_link-1961" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> Particularly noteworthy is his critical reexamination of the polarity between erudition and essentialism. His conclusion that essentialism must operate from the intellectual base of erudition leaves not even the slightest doubt as to where he placed his own emphasis.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1841" id="calibre_link-1962" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> It may well be construed as a logical extension of his fundamental emphasis on inquiry and study.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1098" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In Song Neo-Confucianism, not only was the primordial Confucian polarity between learning and thinking transformed into a dichotomy of knowledge and morality, but out of that polarity, a tension also gradually grew between what may be called, respectively, intellectualism and anti-intellectualism. The possible implications of these last two elusive terms in Chinese intellectual history are explored more fully in the appendix to this paper. Suffice it to say now, though, that there were two major types of Neo-Confucians: those whose minds were more “inquiry and study” orientated; those who tended to assign a greater role to knowledge in the Confucian scheme of things; and those whose minds were more “moral nature” orientated and who tended to take acquisition of knowledge, including even knowledge of the classics, to be the least essential part of Confucian teachings. For convenience, we will simply term the first type intellectualists and the second type anti-intellectualists. In this very loose sense, therefore, Zhu Xi belongs to the intellectualist type, whereas Lu Xiangshan belongs to the anti-intellectualist type.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Corresponding to this general distinction between intellectualism and anti-intellectualism, there also arose a unique Neo-Confucian theory of knowledge, which distinguishes between what may be termed, again for convenience, intellectual knowledge and moral knowledge. This theory was first put forward by Zhang Zai <span>張</span><span>載</span> (1020&ndash;1077),<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1842" id="calibre_link-1963" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> but later was more neatly formulated in the writings of Cheng Yi <span>程</span><span>頤</span> (1033&ndash;1107). Cheng said: “The knowledge obtained through hearing and seeing is not the knowledge obtained through moral nature. When a thing (the body) comes into contact with things, the knowledge so obtained is not from within. This is what is meant by extensive learning and much ability today. The knowledge obtained from moral nature does not depend on seeing and hearing.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1843" id="calibre_link-1964" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> Clearly, then, according to this theory, moral knowledge (<i class="calibre9">dexing zhi zhi</i> <span>德</span><span>性</span><span>之</span><span>知</span>) differs categorically from all other knowledge, which comes from the senses’ contact with the external world (<i class="calibre9">wenjian zhizhi</i> <span>聞</span><span>見</span><span>之</span><span>知</span> or “intellectual knowledge”). It deals exclusively with the inner world of man’s moral nature. This distinction between moral knowledge and intellectual knowledge also has its counterpart in Christianity. According to one view, the so-called truths propounded by faith form what is known as “religious” knowledge. And religious knowledge differs from other knowledge in that it deals with a “higher realm,” to which rational inquiry and its methods have no access at all.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1844" id="calibre_link-1965" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> Just as Tertullian’s denunciation of classical pagan culture led to Christian anti-intellectualism, the Neo-Confucian elevation of moral knowledge to a level beyond the reach of the senses also inevitably gave rise to anti-intellectualistic tendencies. From Zhang Zai to Wang Yangming <span>王</span><span>陽</span><span>明</span> (1472&ndash;1529), many individual Neo-Confucians repudiated, to a greater or lesser degree, intellectual knowledge on the ground that it can shed no light on our knowledge of the moral nature. The Cheng-Zhu school on the whole, for example, was, in the Song Period, more intellectualistic in its theoretical orientations. In early Ming times, however, even this school underwent a transformation in the anti-intellectualistic direction, resulting in a clear subordination of the intellectual element within the entire Cheng-Zhu system.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1845" id="calibre_link-1966" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> Not until late Ming and early Qing did the pendulum slowly but steadily swing back to the other side. In terms of these trends, therefore, I suggest that Qing intellectual history may be more meaningfully viewed as a period that witnessed the rise of Confucian intellectualism.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">THE HAN-SONG CONTROVERSY IN QING INTELLECTUAL HISTORY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1122" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Reevaluation of Qing intellectual history in terms of Confucian intellectualism, however, must begin with a critical review of some of the dominant theses advanced by modern scholars to deal specifically with the nature of Qing learning and its significance in the Confucian tradition as a whole. In the mid-eighteenth century, a major controversy arose between proponents of the so-called Han Learning (<i class="calibre9">Han xue</i> <span>漢</span><span>學</span>) and adherents of Song Learning (<i class="calibre9">Song xue</i> <span>宋</span><span>學</span>), a controversy that, as will be shown below, characterized much of Chinese intellectual history until the end of the nineteenth century. To begin with, it may be noted that the term “Han Learning” is actually a name Qing scholars applied to their own philological approach to the study of the Confucian classics, an approach they believed was very much in the exegetical tradition of the Han times. It is also known by the name of <i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i> <span>考</span><span>證</span> or <i class="calibre9">kaoju</i> <span>考</span><span>據</span>, meaning, literally, “evidential investigation.” On the other hand, “Song Learning” is a reference to the type of metaphysical speculations started by, though not confined to, Song Neo-Confucians. During the Qing Period, it was also called <i class="calibre9">yili</i> <span>義</span><span>理</span>, which may be rendered as “moral principles.” Hence, very imprecisely speaking, Han Learning (<i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i>) and Song Learning (<i class="calibre9">yili</i>) are the Chinese equivalents of the two respective Western terms “philology” and “philosophy.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1846" id="calibre_link-1967" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>This Han-Song controversy later became the conceptual starting point for various modern interpretations of Qing intellectual history. Thus, we find in most, if not all, modern interpretations that Song Learning is generally identified with the entire Song-Ming philosophical tradition (or simply, as in current Western usage, Neo-Confucianism), whereas Han Learning is equated with Qing philology. Insofar as the relationship between Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism and Qing learning is concerned, two basic classical views may be distinguished. The first view stresses discontinuity in intellectual history and therefore suggests that Qing learning was beginning when Neo-Confucianism was ending: Liang Qichao and Hu Shi are the chief proponents of this thesis. Liang implies this discontinuity when he says, “The point of departure of Qing learning was a violent reaction against the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1847" id="calibre_link-1968" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> Hu Shi is even more precise. In his view, the Neo-Confucian philosophical tradition, which had begun during the Northern Song, came to a sudden end with the Qing. With the beginning of the Qing dynasty, Chinese intellectual history entered into an entirely new age.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1848" id="calibre_link-1969" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1060" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The second view of the relationship between Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism and Qing learning stresses historical continuity rather than discontinuity; it sees the Neo-Confucian philosophical tradition being carried well into the Qing Period. Fung Yu-lan (Feng Youlan) and Ch’ien Mu (Qian Mu) may be taken as the two outstanding representatives of this second thesis. According to Fung, when the School of Han Learning in the Qing came to deal with philosophy, “the topics that were discussed…and the classical texts that were used remained the same as those of the Song and Ming Neo-Confucians. From this point of view, therefore, the Han Learning of the Qing was a continuation of Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1849" id="calibre_link-1970" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> Qian Mu’s concern is much broader than philosophical discussion and textual analysis. He is ultimately concerned with Neo-Confucianism as a living intellectual as well as moral tradition. In this sense, he points out, Song Learning was highly active among the leading Ming loyalist-scholars in Qing times. Han Learning, both as a name and a reality, did not come into existence until the reign of Qianlong (1736&ndash;1796). And still during that time, in his estimation, many of the classical philologists were still profoundly steeped in the Neo-Confucian tradition. More often than not, he further argues, a scholar’s achievement in Han Learning was measurable in terms of his orientations in Song Learning.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1850" id="calibre_link-1971" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The two dominant theses of continuity or discontinuity, opposed to each other as they appear to be, nevertheless share a common ground. In the Liang-Hu thesis, Han Learning and Song Learning are treated as if they were diametrically antithetical to each other from the very beginning. To this obviously overdrawn distinction, the Fung-Qian thesis has served as an important corrective. Even in the Fung-Qian thesis, however, there is no denying that Song Learning and Han Learning are, in their most mature forms, two entirely different types of intellectual discipline, each of which must be pursued according to its own rules. In terms familiar to the Qing scholars, Song Learning seeks to establish, chiefly through metaphysical speculations, Confucian “moral principles,” whereas Han Learning attempts as its central task to examine, critically and always on the basis of textual evidence, the very grounds of such “principles.” Therefore, in the last analysis, the real difference between the two schools of classical interpretation boils down to whether the Neo-Confucian philosophical tradition died a sudden and violent death in the early Qing or a slow and natural death in the middle Qing.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1851" id="calibre_link-1972" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>From the point of view of intellectual history, the continuity thesis of Fung and Qian does seem more attractive and satisfying than the discontinuity thesis of Liang and Hu. It still leaves something to be desired, however. To register just one particular complaint, it does not address itself specifically enough to the question of the inner logic in the fundamental transformation from Song-Ming philosophy of Qing philology. Of this inner logic, more will be discussed below. For the moment, a word or two must be said about the Han-Song controversy itself.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1109" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This controversy started with the claim of mid-Qing philologists that through their thorough textual investigations of the basic Confucian sources, they had brought to light for the first time since the Han dynasty the true meanings of the sages’ <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. By contrast, as they asserted, Song Neo-Confucianism was based, more often than not, on incorrect readings of the Confucian texts, which, in turn, resulted from the Song thinkers’ inadequacy or even lack in philological training. In the eighteenth century, Hui Dong <span>惠</span><span>棟</span> (1697&ndash;1758) and Dai Zhen <span>戴</span><span>震</span> (1723&ndash;1777), the two great masters of philology, contributed, each in his own way, to this sharp distinction between Han Learning and Song Learning. Hui not only denounced Song Neo-Confucianism as no more than a mixture of Chan Buddhism and Daoism,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1852" id="calibre_link-1973" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup> he even accused Song Neo-Confucians of illiteracy (<i class="calibre9">Song Ru bu shizi</i> <span>宋</span><span>儒</span><span>不</span><span>識</span><span>字</span>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1853" id="calibre_link-1974" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> Dai’s position on this matter is nowhere more clearly shown than in the following statement:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>It has often been said that there is Han classical learning and there is Song classical learning; the former is philological in approach and the latter, philosophical. I am greatly puzzled by this statement. Alas, if the so-called philosophical ideas (of the sages) can be obtained by sheer speculation apart from the classics, then anyone is able to grasp them out of emptiness. If that is so, what do we need classical learning for? It is precisely because sheer speculation cannot lead one to the ancient sages’ philosophical ideas that one has to seek them from the ancient classics. Since messages contained in the surviving records have gradually fallen into oblivion due to the expanse of time between the past and the present, one therefore has to seek them through etymological studies (of the classics). Thus, only if etymology is clear, can the ancient classics be understood, and only if the classics are understood, can the sages’ philosophical ideas be grasped.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1854" id="calibre_link-1975" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1241" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>By the time of the nineteenth century, the Han-Song controversy was greatly intensified as well as publicized with the publication of Jiang Fan <span>江</span><span>藩</span> (1761&ndash;1831)’s <i class="calibre9">Hanxue shicheng ji</i> <span>漢</span><span>學</span><span>師</span><span>承</span><span>記</span> (Record of the transmission of the Masters of the School of Han Learning). Jiang, it may be noted, was a second-generation disciple of Hui Dong.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1855" id="calibre_link-1976" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup> Jiang’s glorification of Han Learning of Qing drew immediate critical reaction from Gong Zizhen <span>龔</span><span>自</span><span>珍</span> (1792&ndash;1841), who first read the work in manuscript form. In his letter to Jiang, written sometime in 1817, Gong listed altogether ten reasons to oppose application of the term “Han Learning” to the Qing case. In his opinion, “Classical Learning” (<i class="calibre9">jingxue</i> <span>經</span><span>學</span>) would be a more appropriate appellation. He was particularly dissatisfied with the arbitrary distinction between “Song Learning” and “Han Learning.” As he saw it, neither did Han Confucians shun metaphysical speculation, nor were Song Neo-Confucians entirely ignorant of philological analysis of classical texts.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1856" id="calibre_link-1977" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup> Gong’s views proved to be widely shared by scholars of various intellectual persuasions in nineteenth-century China. The following three examples, selected on the basis of representativeness, should suffice to serve the purpose of illustration. Fang Dongshu <span>方</span><span>東</span><span>樹</span> (1772&ndash;1851) from Tongcheng <span>桐</span><span>城</span> reacted most strongly and directly to Jiang’s book with his influential and controversial <i class="calibre9">Hanxue shangdui</i> <span>漢</span><span>學</span><span>商</span><span>兌</span> (Critical evaluation of Han Learning), 1826. In this book Fang launched a systematic and all-out attack on the so-called Han Learning. He emphatically made the point that Song Neo-Confucians, especially Zhu Xi, were very much at home with philology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1857" id="calibre_link-1978" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup> Chen Li <span>陳</span><span>澧</span> (1810&ndash;1882), himself a classical philologist of great distinction, wrote the <i class="calibre9">Hanru tongyi</i> <span>漢</span><span>儒</span><span>通</span><span>義</span> (Penetrating the meanings of the Han Confucians) to show that, contrary to the view held by fellow philologists of his day, Han Confucians were interested in philosophy no less than Song Neo-Confucians.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1858" id="calibre_link-1979" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup> Huang Yizhou <span>黃</span><span>以</span><span>周</span> (1828&ndash;1899), the last giant of the Eastern Zhejiang school, also considered the so-called Han-Song distinction to be overdrawn. In his words: “There are cases in which Zheng (Xuan)’s <span>鄭</span><span>玄</span> philosophical remarks (on the classics) are better than Zhu Xi’s, and Zhu Xi’s philological explication of the text is superior to Zheng’s. To insist that we must follow the Han philologically and the Song philosophically, thus splitting (classical learning) into two separate parts, is but a parochial view of the conventionalistic type of Confucian.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1859" id="calibre_link-1980" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup> Criticism of this kind immediately calls into question the nature of Song Learning as it has been traditionally defined. More important, it also forces us to reopen the discussion of how Qing philology is related to Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism in general, and the Cheng-Zhu tradition (known also as <i class="calibre9">Lixue</i> <span>理</span><span>學</span> “Rationalism”) in particular. Earlier we noted that both Hui Dong and Dai Zhen actually claimed not only that Qing philology was independent of Neo-Confucianism but also that it should replace the latter as the new Confucian orthodoxy. According to Zhang Xuecheng’s <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span> (1738&ndash;1801) firsthand account, it was precisely this philological claim to independence and orthodoxy that led followers of Dai Zhen, if not Dai himself, to believe that Dai’s Neo-Classicism had completely demolished Neo-Confucian Rationalism and that their master, Dai Zhen, would soon take the place of Zhu Xi in the Confucian pantheon.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1860" id="calibre_link-1981" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>At this point, some intriguing questions arise. For example, is it true that apart from being a negative response, Qing philology owed nothing to Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism? Is it really the case that Qing philologists picked up the thread of Confucian classical learning where Han exegetes left it? If the distinction between Han Learning and Song Learning is ultimately reducible to the distinction between classical scholarship and metaphysical speculation, as most Qing controversialists seem to have agreed, is the Han-Song controversy somehow historically and structurally related to the various Confucian polarities, discussed previously, such as “learning” and “thinking,” “erudition” and “essentialism,” “following the path of inquiry and study” and “honoring the moral nature,” etc.? Needless to say, there are no ready-made answers to all these questions.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1299" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Fortunately, some of Zhang Xuecheng’s writings provide us with interesting clues as to how such answers can be found. As an intellectual historian, he refused to accept at face value the then-fashionable distinction between Han Learning and Song Learning. He fully recognized the importance of philology to Confucian learning as a whole, but questioned the validity of the Qing philological claim beyond the methodological level.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1861" id="calibre_link-1982" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup> In two richly suggestive essays, “Zhu and Lu” (<span>朱</span><span>陸</span>) and “Zhedong xueshu” <span>浙</span><span>東</span><span>學</span><span>術</span> (The Zhedong intellectual tradition), he offered his own account of Neo-Confucian developments from Southern Song times to his own day. It is interesting to note that in Zhang’s account, the true intellectual heirs to Zhu Xi in the Qing are to be found in the line of classical philologists from Gu Yanwu <span>顧</span><span>炎</span><span>武</span> (1613&ndash;1682) to Dai Zhen, whereas the intellectual successors to Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming are to be found in the line of what he called Eastern Zhejiang historians from Huang Zongxi <span>黃</span><span>宗</span><span>羲</span> (1610&ndash;1695) to, presumably, Zhang himself. In these two essays as well as elsewhere, he further characterized the two separate intellectual traditions in the Qing mainly in terms of “erudition” versus “essentialism.” It is in this sense that he called, respectively, classical philologists “erudites” (<i class="calibre9">boya</i> <span>博</span><span>雅</span>) and Eastern Zhejiang scholars “specialists” (<i class="calibre9">zhuanjia</i> <span>專</span><span>家</span>), “specialization” in Zhang’s terminology being interchangeable with “essentialism.” Moreover, Zhang often used the term “essentialism” in an intellectual rather than a moral context. It no longer meant “moralizing” or “grasping what is morally essential” but came very close to what we would call “synthesizing” or “systematizing.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1862" id="calibre_link-1983" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup> Zhang’s redefinition of “essentialism” is highly indicative of the climate of opinion during his time. Intellectualization of key Confucian moral concepts must be regarded as a sign of the rise of Confucian intellectualism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1863" id="calibre_link-1984" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To sum up, Zhang’s thesis throws an entirely different light on the Han-Song controversy in Qing intellectual history. First, it treats the Han-Song distinction as more apparent than real. For if, as most late Qing controversialists suggested, Han Learning consists essentially of classical philology, then it cannot possibly be antithetical to Song Neo-Confucianism, and much less so to Zhu Xi’s tradition, which, with its built-in emphasis on inquiry and study, presupposes philology on the methodological level. Second, Zhang’s thesis stresses continuity between Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism and Qing learning from a point of view distinctly his own. Both Neo-Confucian schools of Zhu and Lu extended well into the Qing Period, but a metamorphosis transformed their extension: what had separated the two schools previously in the area of metaphysical speculations now continued to do so in the realm of classical and historical studies. Thus, we find that the previous division into two systems of thought has become a distinction between two approaches to empirical studies. There was not, therefore, as Fung Youlan defined it, a continuity limited to common philosophical topics and texts. Third, the central problem in Qing intellectual history arose not so much out of the distinction between Han Learning and Song Learning as it did from a renewed tension between “erudition” and “essentialism”&mdash;a tension, however, that had shifted from moral grounds to intellectual grounds. Particular attention must be called to the fact that Zhang placed Han Learning squarely in Zhu Xi’s tradition. This is tantamount to saying that Han Learning was more than mere philology (<i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i>). In fact, Zhang recognized in the Qing philological movement, from Gu Yanwu to Dai Zhen, a central philosophical point, which derived from Zhu Xi’s emphasis on inquiry and study as a starting point for the quest for the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. According to Zhang’s thesis, therefore, Han Learning can claim its immediacy to <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> only when it rises above philology.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1114" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the pages that immediately follow, I shall first try to clarify the term “Song Learning.” Only with this clarification can we expect to develop a more objective and balanced view of Neo-Confucianism. Then, on the basis of a redefinition of Song Learning, I shall propose a new scheme of periodization, according to which the development of Neo-Confucianism from the early Song to the mid-Qing times may be understood in terms of the inner logic of intellectual history. When we return to the Qing case at a later juncture, it is hoped that some of the profound implications of Zhang Xuecheng’s thesis will also become more readily appreciable.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">TWO CONCEPTS OF SONG LEARNING</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Generally speaking, we can discern two different concepts of Song Learning in Chinese intellectual history. The first concept, defined in a narrow sense, identifies Song Learning with metaphysical speculation on the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. This concept was formally established in the Yuan Period when a new category of <i class="calibre9">Daoxue</i> <span>道</span><span>學</span> was adopted in the <i class="calibre9">Songshi</i> (History of the Song Dynasty) to honor the thinkers of the Cheng-Zhu school.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1864" id="calibre_link-1985" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">43</a></small></sup> It was greatly strengthened in the Ming, during which time metaphysical speculation happened to be the dominant form of Confucianism. The Ming acceptance of this narrow interpretation of Song Learning is well illustrated by the fact that the “Daoxue Biographies” in the <i class="calibre9">History of the Song</i> were published as a separate book, for which Chen Xianzhang <span>陳</span><span>獻</span><span>章</span> (1428&ndash;1500) wrote an important foreword (<i class="calibre9">xu</i> <span>序</span>) in 1485.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1865" id="calibre_link-1986" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">44</a></small></sup> Furthermore, attention must also be called to the unique and unexcelled Ming contributions to Confucian speculative philosophy. In the estimate of Huang Zongxi:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The literary and practical accomplishments of the Ming did not measure up to those of former dynasties. Yet in the “philosophy of Principle (<i class="calibre9">Lixue</i> <span>理</span><span>學</span>) it attained what other dynasties did not. In everything Ming scholars made the finest of distinctions and classifications, as if they were sorting the hair of an ox or picking silk threads from a cocoon. They thereby discovered what other scholars had failed to discover.” <sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1866" id="calibre_link-1987" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">45</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>It was through this kind of metaphysically colored telescope of the Ming that the metaphysical importance of Song Learning was magnified out of proportion in the Qing. When Qing philologists talked about Song Learning unanalytically, they meant, almost without exception, <i class="calibre9">Daoxue</i> or <i class="calibre9">Lixue</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1867" id="calibre_link-1988" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">46</a></small></sup> In modern times, this narrow concept of Song Learning still continues to enjoy great popularity. Metaphysical speculation is seen to be what is essentially new in the Song revival of Confucian learning.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1868" id="calibre_link-1989" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">47</a></small></sup> The concept has even penetrated into the Western intellectual world. The Western term, Neo-Confucianism, for example, is used mainly as an equivalent of <i class="calibre9">Daoxue</i> or <i class="calibre9">Lixue</i> in Chinese, although such an interpretation often presents difficulties.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1869" id="calibre_link-1990" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">48</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1095" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Intellectual historians, however, have long been critical of this partial and restricted view of Song Learning. Huang Zongxi, for instance, found little sense in the creation of the new category “Daoxue” in the <i class="calibre9">History of the Song</i>. In his judgment, the traditional category <i class="calibre9">Rulin</i> <span>儒</span><span>林</span> (Confucian Scholars) is quite adequate to take care of the so-called <i class="calibre9">Daoxue</i> philosophers such as Zhou Dunyi, the Cheng brothers, Zhang Zai, and Zhu Xi. The <i class="calibre9">Daoxue</i> category is particularly misleading because it tends to suggest that the transmission of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is separable from that of the Confucian classics, the latter being the central concern of the traditional <i class="calibre9">Rulin</i> category.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1870" id="calibre_link-1991" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">49</a></small></sup> This leads to a second and broadly defined concept of Song Learning, which Huang developed in his unfinished <i class="calibre9">Song-Yuan Xue-an</i> <span>宋</span><span>元</span><span>學</span><span>案</span> (Scholarly cases of Song and Yuan classical scholars).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1871" id="calibre_link-1992" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">50</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In <i class="calibre9">Scholarly Cases of Song and Yuan Classical Scholars</i>, Hu Yuan <span>胡</span><span>瑗</span> (993&ndash;1059), Sun Fu <span>孫</span><span>復</span> (992&ndash;1057), Fan Zhongyan <span>范</span><span>仲</span><span>淹</span> (989&ndash;1052), and Ou-yang Xiu <span>歐</span><span>陽</span><span>修</span> (1007&ndash;1072) are treated, in that order, as the founders of Song Learning, none of whom, it may be noted, achieved any distinction in metaphysical speculation. In offering this new interpretation of the Confucian revival in the early Song, both Huang Zongxi’s and Quan Zuwang’s <span>全</span><span>祖</span><span>望</span> (1705&ndash;1755) historical judgments are well grounded. Methodologically, they distinguished the premetaphysical conception of Song Confucianism from the metaphysically colored view of the later periods. Thus, in each and every case of the above four Neo-Confucian scholars, the choice was made on the basis of a Song evaluation. As Quan Zuwang clearly explained in his “Introductory Remarks”:<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1872" id="calibre_link-1993" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">51</a></small></sup> “Hu Yuan and Sun Fu were selected as the forerunners of Song Learning because they had been so recommended by both Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi. The placement of Fan Zhongyan next to Hu and Sun was originally also Zhu Xi’s idea. In the case of Ou-yang Xiu, he was included in spite of his aversion to metaphysical speculation.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1873" id="calibre_link-1994" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">52</a></small></sup> On the authority of Yang Shi <span>楊</span><span>時</span> (1053&ndash;1135), however, Quan Zuwang insisted that Ou-yang Xiu’s status as a Neo-Confucian scholar and thinker must be reestablished. He should be much more than merely a master of Song literature.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In a sense, it may be contended that what Huang Zongxi and Quan Zuwang were attempting was actually a historical reconstruction of the self-image of Song Neo-Confucianism. In this regard, they must be considered highly successful, for, interestingly enough, their reconstruction of the early Song Neo-Confucian development is confirmed by the following observation of the Southern Song scholar Chen Fuliang <span>陳</span><span>傅</span><span>良</span> (1137&ndash;1203):</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1223" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>With the rise of the Song, [the style of] learning among scholars underwent no less than three changes. From the reign of <i class="calibre9">jianlong</i> <span>建</span><span>隆</span> (960&ndash;962) to the reigns of <i class="calibre9">tiansheng</i> <span>天</span><span>聖</span> (1023&ndash;1031) and <i class="calibre9">mingdao</i> <span>明</span><span>道</span> (1032&ndash;1033), vulgar [intellectual] customs dating from the period of the Five Dynasties were wiped out. [Scholars] then had a clearer idea of the direction [in which learning] should be developed. However, some of the old and conventionalized practices were yet to be transformed. Then Fan Zhongyan and his followers came to the forefront, promoting moral integrity as a timely remedy. Prompted by a sense of shame, everybody in the Empire followed their lead. When Ou-yang Xiu appeared on the scene, he impressed the world with the purity and elegance of both his expressed ideas and his literary art, which far surpassed those of the Wei and Jin periods. Finally, after a while, Zhou Dunyi <span>周</span><span>敦</span><span>頤</span> (1027&ndash;1073) entered the field. He dropped all the nonessential embellishments and founded his learning primarily on the basis of the Six Classics.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1874" id="calibre_link-1995" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">53</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>This account agrees even in detail with the Huang-Quan thesis presented in the <i class="calibre9">Scholarly Cases of Song and Yuan Classical Scholars</i>. Although the names of Hu Yuan and Sun Fu are not mentioned, Chen Fuliang must have had them in mind when he referred to the beginning of a new sense of direction in learning in the <i class="calibre9">mingdao</i> period, for it was precisely that period which marks the beginning of the lasting influence of Hu Yuan’s Neo-Confucian educational program, established first in Suzhou and finally in the Imperial Academy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1875" id="calibre_link-1996" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">54</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Thus, in contrast to the narrowly defined view, a broad conception of early Song Neo-Confucianism eventually crystallized. Consciously distinguishing these two different concepts of Song Learning is essential to our understanding of the relationship between Han Learning and Song Learning. To say the least, unnecessary confusion of different levels of discussion in the Han-Song controversy can be avoided. With this clarification, it can be readily recognized that while Qing scholars such as Hui Dong and Dai Zhen attacked Song Learning in its narrow sense, others such as Gong Zizhen and Fang Dongshu defended it in its broad sense.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Much of the entangled nature of the long-standing Han-Song Learning controversy therefore results from the fact that the controversialists are not always talking about the same Song Learning. A clear recognition of the fact that there have been two conceptual levels of Song Learning is equally important for the interpretation of the nature of Qing intellectual history, especially in the way the Qing intellectual development stands in relation to the Song. It is one thing to contrast Qing philology with Song Neo-Confucianism in its narrow, metaphysical sense, but it is an entirely different matter to explain the rise of Qing philology against the background of the whole Neo-Confucian tradition conceived in broad terms. While the former approach suggests discontinuity, the latter implies continuity. As an intellectual historian, my emphasis will be placed on the latter approach, although I wish also to show specifically how Neo-Confucian metaphysical speculation eventually gets itself helplessly involved in a philological argument.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1876" id="calibre_link-1997" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">55</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1170" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Although the meaning of the narrow concept of Song Learning has always been clear, Song Learning in its broad sense is not readily susceptible to a simple, neat definition. It hinges very much on how the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> was conceived by the early Song Neo-Confucians. In this connection, a much quoted passage by Liu Yi <span>劉</span><span>彛</span>(1017&ndash;1086) may be cited to serve as a basis for our discussion. In 1069, Liu Yi, a leading disciple of Hu Yuan, explained the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> to Emperor Shenzong in the following words:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Your minister has heard that the Way (<i class="calibre9">Dao</i>) of the Sages has three aspects: substance (<i class="calibre9">ti</i> <span>體</span>), function (<i class="calibre9">yong</i> <span>用</span>) and literary expression (<i class="calibre9">wen</i> <span>文</span>). The bond between prince and minister and between father and son, humanity, righteousness, rites and music&mdash;these are things which do not change through the ages; they are the substance of Dao<i class="calibre9">.</i> The <i class="calibre9">Classic of Poetry</i> and the <i class="calibre9">Classic of History</i>, the dynastic histories, the writings of the philosophers and the works of men of letters&mdash;these perpetuate the example down through the ages; they are the Dao’s literary expression. To activate this substance and put it into practice throughout the empire, enriching the life of the people and ordering all things to imperial perfection&mdash;this is its function.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1877" id="calibre_link-1998" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">56</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>As de Bary observes, “In this threefold conception of the Dao, we have a concise statement of the aims of the Song school in their most general terms…suggesting broad lines along which it was to be developed by the manifold activities of Song scholars.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1878" id="calibre_link-1999" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">57</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Liu’s threefold formulation of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> may be briefly explained as follows: Of the three aspects, the <i class="calibre9">ti</i>, or substance, is, of course, most fundamental to Neo-Confucianism. Since Liu was no metaphysician, he merely described it in plain language and presented it as no more than a set of Confucian ethical principles governing human relationships of various kinds. Like most Neo-Confucians of his day, however, he also firmly believed that the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is not subject to change. It was precisely this belief that led other Neo-Confucians with a metaphysical turn of mind to search intensively for the metaphysical foundations of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. In its extreme form, as Dai Zhen later pointed out, the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> (or its equivalent <i class="calibre9">Li</i> “Principle”) was conceived as a completely self-sufficient metaphysical entity that, “being obtained from Heaven, becomes embodied in the mind.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1879" id="calibre_link-2000" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">58</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Liu uses the term <i class="calibre9">wen</i> (literary expressions) in a very broad sense. It practically includes all the four major categories of books in traditional bibliographical classifications. It is not clear whether by the name <i class="calibre9">zi</i> <span>子</span>, Liu meant writings of all philosophical schools or those of the Confucians only. Even if he intended the latter meaning, the whole range of “literary expressions” was already wide enough to engage the energy and time of scholars for generations.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1358" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The problem of function (<i class="calibre9">yong</i>) of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is immensely complicated and therefore requires further comment. To begin with, it must be emphasized that in the Neo-Confucian context, substance and function are but two sides of the same coin. Logically, the two imply each other. In this sense, then, the functional aspect of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> must be regarded as far more important and real than its literary (including classical or, more appropriately, scriptural) traditions. The functions of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> are multitudinous, however. Therefore, those mentioned in Liu’s statement can only be considered as a very incomplete list given by way of illustration. Upon closer scrutiny, one will find that Liu’s functions are essentially of the political and social kind. In the most general terms, the functions of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> may be classified into two major categories, which correspond, respectively, to what is commonly referred to as “sageliness within and kingliness without” (<i class="calibre9">neisheng waiwang</i> <span>內</span><span>聖</span><span>外</span><span>王</span>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1880" id="calibre_link-2001" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">59</a></small></sup> To borrow a more clearly formulated expression from the seventeenth century writer Shao Tingcai <span>邵</span><span>廷</span><span>采</span> (1648&ndash;1711), the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> functions “outwardly to put the world in order and inwardly to nourish man’s nature and feelings” (<i class="calibre9">wai qi jingshi</i>, <i class="calibre9">nei yang xingqing</i> <span>外</span><span>期</span><span>經</span><span>世</span>, <span>內</span><span>養</span><span>性</span><span>情</span>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1881" id="calibre_link-2002" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">60</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the history of Confucianism in general and of Neo-Confucianism in particular, the internal functioning of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> was manifested mainly in the form of moral self-cultivation. Moral cultivation involved relatively fewer complications because at least in theory, attainment of “sageliness within” needed nothing from outside. On the other hand, however, the external functioning of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in terms of putting the world in order presented a perennially difficult problem to the Confucians. This aspect of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> transcended the realm of thought and depended for its final solution on external factors, which were, by definition, beyond the control of Confucian thinkers as individuals. As history has repeatedly shown, each time external conditions proved unfavorable for the realization of Confucian ideals, the Confucians withdrew to their own inner world of ideas with the expectation that after sufficient waiting, they could find a better opportunity to emerge. In this regard, the life of Confucius is highly symbolic of the fate of Confucianism in later Chinese history. According to tradition, Confucius turned to the world of classical scholarship only after he had accepted the fact that it was impossible for the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> he promoted to prevail in the outside world. It may be suggested that the pattern of withdrawal and return, to borrow a favorite expression of Arnold J. Toynbee, is ever-recurrent and characterizes a large part of the long, frustrating historical experience of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in its quest for political and social realization, from Confucius himself down to Gu Yanwu and Huang Zongxi.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1882" id="calibre_link-2003" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">61</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">NEO-CONFUCIANISM: A NEW SCHEME OF PERIODIZATION</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1246" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>With Song Neo-Confucianism so broadly defined, a new periodization of the whole Neo-Confucian intellectual development from the Song to the Qing may be attempted. Three different stages of the development can be clearly discerned. The Song Period represents the beginning and first stage of Neo-Confucianism when all the three aspects of the Tao&mdash;substance, function, and literary, including scriptural tradition&mdash;found their lively expressions. The middle and second stage began in late Southern Song and culminated in the Ming dynasty. In this stage, metaphysical speculations on the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> eventually gained ascendancy over the other two aspects in Neo-Confucianism. Thus, the functional aspect was largely confined to the realm of “sageliness within” or moral self-cultivation, and the study of the Confucian literary tradition on the whole ceased to make any significant progress. It was also during this period that the idea of Song Learning in its narrow sense gradually became crystallized. The final and third stage clearly started in the late Ming and early Qing times and came to full fruition in the eighteenth century. The central task Neo-Confucian scholars set for themselves during this third period was to restudy as well as to purify the Confucian literary tradition, especially the scriptural domain. The quest for the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> through moral self-cultivation was definitely out of fashion, as was the interest in the internal aspect of the function of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. It would be unjust, however, to say that Qing scholars were entirely unconcerned with the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. In fact, they justified classical and historical studies as a Confucian calling on the ground that the quest for the true Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> must begin with intellectual clarification. Nor was the idea of function with respect to “kingliness without” completely dead during this whole period. On the contrary, the idea still showed great vitality throughout the third stage. For example, it pulsed vibrantly through the political criticisms of the Donglin <span>東</span><span>林</span> movement of the late Ming Period, the expectations of Gu Yanwu and Huang Zongxi, the “pragmatism” of Yan Yuan <span>顏</span><span>元</span> (1635&ndash;1704) and Li Gong <span>李</span><span>塨</span> (1659&ndash;1733), the political and social philosophy of Dai Zhen, and Zhang Xuecheng’s theory of history being “practically serviceable to society” (<i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> <span>經</span><span>世</span>). The rise of the well-known <i class="calibre9">Jingshi</i> school in the nineteenth century, it may be noted, owed much to the intellectual inspirations of Zhang’s writings. Even with all these modifications, the final stage of the Neo-Confucian development is clearly marked by a much more genuine interest in the Confucian scriptural tradition (<i class="calibre9">wen</i>) than in either the substantial (<i class="calibre9">ti</i>) or functional (<i class="calibre9">yong</i>) aspect of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1159" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>We must now proceed to analyze the above three stages of development of Neo-Confucianism in terms of the inner logic of intellectual history. As Liu Yi’s statement indicates, early Song Neo-Confucians meant to develop the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> along three broad lines through manifold activities, which, in fact, they did. It hardly needs to be said that the long and distinguished genealogy of Neo-Confucian philosophers, from Chou Dunyi, Zhang Zai, and the two Cheng brothers all the way to Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan, was primarily concerned with the quest for the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. As regards <i class="calibre9">wen</i> (literary expressions), however, the Song accomplishments have long been underestimated. Recent studies have convincingly shown that in the fields of classical and historical studies, Song scholars distinguished themselves in at least two aspects: first, their critical investigations and reevaluations covered almost every single aspect of the ancient cultural heritage; second, even in terms of methodological innovations, they also anticipated much of what has been generally considered as unique contributions of Qing philologists.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1883" id="calibre_link-2004" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">62</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in the Song, like Christian faith during the Reformation, “is a busy, active thing. It changes society and builds the Kingdom.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1884" id="calibre_link-2005" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">63</a></small></sup> A major curriculum reform Hu Yuan introduced into the Imperial Academy in the third decade of the eleventh century, for example, placed emphatic stress on “management of practical affairs” (<i class="calibre9">zhishi</i> <span>治</span><span>事</span>) alongside classical studies (the so-called <i class="calibre9">jingyi</i> <span>經</span><span>義</span>) in Confucian higher education.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1885" id="calibre_link-2006" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">64</a></small></sup> Needless to say, classical scholarship dealt with the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> and “management of practical affairs” dealt with its function or application. This simultaneous concern with both substance and function is by no means unique with Hu Yuan. In fact, it is a spirit common to Northern Song Neo-Confucians. Sun Fu’s study of the <i class="calibre9">Chunqiu</i> <span>春</span><span>秋</span> (Spring and Autumn Annals)<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1886" id="calibre_link-2007" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">65</a></small></sup> and Li Gou’s <span>李</span><span>覯</span> (1009&ndash;1059) study of the <i class="calibre9">Zhouli</i> <span>周</span><span>禮</span> (Rites of Zhou),<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1887" id="calibre_link-2008" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">66</a></small></sup> to give two additional examples, show an equally immediate functional sensitivity to the needs of the state and society during Song times. From the point of view of intellectual history, it was out of this Song zeitgeist,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1888" id="calibre_link-2009" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">67</a></small></sup> so to speak, that the reform movement from Fan Zhongyan to Wang Anshi arose, which was the culmination of the functioning of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in the realm of “kingliness without.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The failure of Wang Anshi’s reforms marks a turning point in the development of Neo-Confucianism. It put to an end the Neo-Confucian dream of experimenting with political and social reconstruction and therefore turned Neo-Confucianism inwardly toward the realm of “sageliness within.” In the twelfth century, Neo-Confucianism faced a difficult historical choice between political participation and intellectual withdrawal. Opinion was divided between what may be called the fundamentalist wing<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1889" id="calibre_link-2010" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">68</a></small></sup> of Zhu Xi, Lü Zuqian <span>呂</span><span>祖</span><span>謙</span> (1137&ndash;1181), and Zhang Shi <span>張</span><span>栻</span> (1133&ndash;1180) on the one hand, and the utilitarian wing, including, among others, Chen Liang <span>陳</span><span>亮</span> (1143&ndash;1194) and Ye Shi <span>葉</span><span>適</span> (1150&ndash;1223) on the other. While the latter group continued to preach immediate political reformism, the former urged a retreat into the intellectual and moral world to tackle what they regarded as the more fundamental issues in Neo-Confucianism. As we all know, it was the fundamentalists that eventually triumphed over their utilitarian rivals. It should be added, however, that the fundamentalists’ retreat was originally conceived as a temporary strategic move, for Zhu Xi and his allies were all profoundly convinced that only when the fundamental issues were satisfactorily solved, could they then expect to return to deal effectively with the practical affairs of state and society.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1890" id="calibre_link-2011" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">69</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1099" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Hence, in terms of Liu Yi’s threefold formulation, it may be said that in Southern Song times, the Neo-Confucian emphasis shifted gradually to the substance (<i class="calibre9">ti</i>) of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, although the idea of function (<i class="calibre9">yong</i>) was still very much alive. In other words, Neo-Confucianism turned away from seeking immediate improvement of the external world and began a long metaphysical journey in search of the inner meanings of the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. This shift, though not clearly perceptible in the beginning, is more or less reflected in the changing views of substance and function in Song Neo-Confucian philosophy. In the eleventh century, for instance, Cheng Yi took substance and function to be of the same origin (<i class="calibre9">tiyong yiyuan</i> <span>體</span><span>用</span><span>一</span><span>源</span>), which suggests that they are the two inseparable aspects of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1891" id="calibre_link-2012" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">70</a></small></sup> But Cheng Yi gave no clear indication as to which of the two aspects should be stressed. In the twelfth century, the idea of the inseparability of substance and function was still current. The emphasis, however, was placed more on substance than on function. On the positive side there was Zhu Xi’s view that “substance generates function,”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1892" id="calibre_link-2013" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">71</a></small></sup> which must be regarded as a significant departure from Cheng Yi’s view. On the negative side, there was Lü Zuqian’s warning against overstressing function. As Lü put it, function is always an essential part of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, but we must not single it out as something of particular importance, for if we do, we would be inevitably led astray.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1893" id="calibre_link-2014" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">72</a></small></sup> Conceivably, Lü’s view was developed as a fundamentalist’s answer to the challenge of the utilitarian wing.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It is difficult to say precisely when the second stage of Neo-Confucianism began. I have been very much tempted to take the Goose Lake Temple Debate between Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan in 1175 as the beginning. However, two reasons make me hesitate to do so. First, the debate was, in all likelihood, more important to Neo-Confucians of later centuries than to those of the twelfth century. Zhu Xi, for instance, only referred to this event casually in some of his letters.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1894" id="calibre_link-2015" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">73</a></small></sup> At any rate, there is no evidence that the debate attracted much immediate attention from Zhu’s and Lu’s contemporaries. Second, in Zhu Xi’s time, a considerable degree of equilibrium was still maintained between the subjective quest of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> through moral cultivation and the objective study of the Confucian scriptural tradition. Zhu Xi himself is a great classical scholar, even judging by the rigid standards of Qing philology.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1250" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>If we must choose a date for the beginning of the second stage, the thirteenth century is preferable to the twelfth. In the middle of the thirteenth century, a serious attempt was made by a certain Tang Zhong <span>湯</span><span>中</span> to reconcile the differences between Zhu’s “following the path of inquiry and study” and Lu’s “honoring the moral nature.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1895" id="calibre_link-2016" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">74</a></small></sup> This is the earliest of such reconciliations in Neo-Confucian intellectual history, after the Goose Lake Debate. Unfortunately, we know very little about the details of Tang Zhong’s reconciliation. However, the very fact that Tang had found it necessary to make such an effort is sufficient indication that the Zhu-Lu controversy had by then already become one of the inner tensions in Neo-Confucianism. From the point of view of intellectual history, it is only logical that a few decades later, in early Yuan times, Wu Cheng <span>吳</span><span>澄</span> (1249&ndash;1333), the well-known and well-respected follower of Zhu Xi, also turned to stress the importance of “honoring the moral nature,” for which he was severely criticized by his contemporaries.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1896" id="calibre_link-2017" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">75</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the second stage, while the functional aspect of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> appears to have receded from the forefront of Confucian consciousness, the quest for the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> became inextricably involved with the whole Confucian scriptural tradition (<i class="calibre9">wen</i>). It was precisely because of this involvement that <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> and <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> became the central tension in Neo-Confucianism. We have seen previously how this central tension implies a dichotomy between morality and knowledge in the Confucian context. Now we must examine briefly and in highly generalized terms how this tension can further be fitted into the analytical scheme provided by Liu Yi’s threefold formulation of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. On the basis of Liu Yi’s formulation, the major controversy in this middle stage of Neo-Confucianism arose from the fact that there were two conflicting views on the role of that part of the Confucian scriptural tradition (<i class="calibre9">wen</i>) that dealt with metaphysical speculations on the substance (<i class="calibre9">ti</i>) of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, as Neo-Confucian philosophers of this second stage all agreed, is predominantly moral in nature. They also basically agreed that true knowledge of this substance can be obtained primarily through the inner light of man’s moral nature. Moral self-cultivation therefore becomes the first and central task for every Neo-Confucian. But what role would the Confucian literary tradition, especially the scriptural domain, play in this inner search for the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>? At this point, we find the Neo-Confucian house extremely divided. At one extreme, there is the view that since all the moral truths about the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> had already been discovered by ancient sages and are contained in their writings, it is important that we study these sources carefully to find out what the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> really is. The primacy of moral cultivation is, of course, not questioned. However, the scriptural tradition is very much emphasized as a necessary intellectual prerequisite for the right kind of moral cultivation. At the other extreme, we find a view that stresses the transcendency of the moral substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. This view does not deny that moral truths had been previously discovered by the sages, but it tends to imply that man’s moral awakening, or recovery of his moral mind, consists, in each and every case, in an original creation and discovery all his own. In other words, no matter how many times the same truth had been discovered by sages before him, a man would still have to find it out all by himself and for himself. With this view, therefore, study of the Confucian literary (including scriptural) sources becomes at least peripheral, if not completely irrelevant, to the quest of the substance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1258" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Needless to say, the above presentation is necessarily oversimplified and overgeneralized. Moreover, between the two extremes, many intermediate views with varying degrees of inclination toward one side or the other can be discerned as well. On the whole, however, the conflict between the two fundamentally divergent attitudes figures centrally in the Neo-Confucian inner tension involving the relationship between “honoring the moral nature” and “following the path of inquiry and study,” or, as the Song distinction goes, between moral knowledge and intellectual knowledge.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>During the Ming Period, when the quest for moral knowledge reigned supreme, what Liu Yi referred to as the “literary expression” (<i class="calibre9">wen</i>) of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> received the least attention from Neo-Confucian philosophers. This situation is most characteristically illustrated by the fact that, historically, the lowest ebb of Confucian classical scholarship comes during the Ming. As Gu Yanwu neatly put it, “Since the adoption of the eight-legged style in the examination, ancient learning has been discarded; with the publication of the <i class="calibre9">Sishu wujing daquan</i> <span>四</span><span>書</span><span>五</span><span>經</span><span>大</span><span>全</span> (Complete Collection of the <i class="calibre9">Four Books and Five Classics</i>), all the old exegeses have fallen into oblivion.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1897" id="calibre_link-2018" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">76</a></small></sup> Although in actual practice Ming Neo-Confucianism ceased to contribute significantly to classical and historical studies, in theory, intellectual knowledge continued to be of central importance in philosophical discussions. The dominant Ming Neo-Confucian theory of knowledge, ranging from Chen Xianzhang to Wang Yangming, as it has been generally known, places moral knowledge in an absolute and completely self-sufficient realm to which intellectual knowledge is not accessible. When this theory is applied to the problem of the Confucian scriptural tradition, it leads inevitably to the radical conclusion that the Six Classics are but dregs of the sages.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1898" id="calibre_link-2019" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">77</a></small></sup> To Wang Yangming, it is even misleading to say that the Six Classics contain all the moral truths about the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. Such truths can exist only in our own moral mind, to which the Six Classics are no more than an index.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1899" id="calibre_link-2020" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">78</a></small></sup> Thus, a sharp contrast is powerfully drawn between moral truths as living truths and the language of the classics as dead language. Given this climate of opinion, textual investigation of the classics is bound to wither away.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-989" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Wang Yangming’s central position in Ming Neo-Confucianism, as has been traditionally established, can hardly be questioned. And yet, he must not be taken as the sole representative of Ming intellectual history.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1900" id="calibre_link-2021" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">79</a></small></sup> No sooner had his theory of knowledge made its enormous impact than a strong philosophical reaction began. From the sixteenth century to the end of the dynasty, many new theories of knowledge were developed by Wang Yangming’s critics as well as revisionists, all emphasizing the importance of the intellectual element in Confucian learning in general and that of the scriptural tradition in particular. Even philology showed its rudimentary but clear beginnings. Ironically enough, to some degree, Wang Yangming got himself involved, perhaps without a conscious realization on his part, in what can only be described as, in a very broad sense, philological exercises. His restoration of the <i class="calibre9">Daxue guben</i><span>大</span><span>學</span><span>古</span><span>本</span> (the so-called “old text of the Great Learning”) is a particular case in point. It served as the point of departure for several important philological studies on the subject in the late Ming and early Qing, involving such important names as Gao Panlong <span>高</span><span>攀</span><span>龍</span> (1562&ndash;1626), Liu Zongzhou <span>劉</span><span>宗</span><span>周</span> (1578&ndash;1645), Chen Que <span>陳</span><span>確</span> (1604&ndash;1677), and Mao Qiling <span>毛</span><span>奇</span><span>齡</span> (1623&ndash;1716). The fact is that in spite of Wang Yangming’s insistence on an intuitive understanding of the classics according to their spirit rather than letter, the Confucian letter nevertheless disturbed him deeply whenever it turned out that at certain vital points, his textual interpretation was at variance with that of an earlier Confucian master, especially Zhu Xi.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In fact, it can be shown that the rise of Qing philology resulted, to a considerable extent, from metaphysical controversies during the late Ming. Elsewhere I have contended that the Confucian movement of “return to the sources,” which had begun in the sixteenth century and extended well into the Qing dynasty, resulted largely from the fact that metaphysical controversialists, being at their wit’s end, appealed to the supreme court of the earliest sages and grounded their arguments ultimately on the sacred texts of the classics.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1901" id="calibre_link-2022" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">80</a></small></sup> Once textual evidence was introduced into the metaphysical lawsuit, it was practically impossible not to call philology to the stand as an expert witness. Thus, philological explication of classical texts gradually replaced moral metaphysical speculation as the chief method for the attainment of Confucian truth (<i class="calibre9">Dao</i>). According to the generally accepted distinction in Qing intellectual history, the former is “solid scholarship” (<i class="calibre9">shixue</i> <span>實</span><span>學</span>) and the latter, “empty words” (<i class="calibre9">kongyan</i> <span>空</span><span>言</span>).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1229" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the last analysis, however, the intellectual transition from the Ming to the Qing is characterized mainly by a shift of emphasis in Neo-Confucianism from the moral element to the intellectual element. In the sixteenth century, due largely to Wang Yangming’s influence, many Neo-Confucians still held fast to the Song distinction between moral knowledge and intellectual knowledge, with the emphasis indubitably placed on the former. By the seventeenth century, however, leading Confucian scholars of varying philosophical persuasions began to take a new turn by assigning to intellectual knowledge a much more important role in the quest for <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. Liu Zongzhou, a critic and revisionist of the Wang Yangming school and mentor of Huang Zongxi, regarded the distinction between the two kinds of knowledge as false. Man’s moral consciousness not only is inseparable from his intellectual nature, but depends on the latter for operation.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1902" id="calibre_link-2023" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">81</a></small></sup> Liu’s view, it may be noted, won the enthusiastic applause of eighteenth-century philologists.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1903" id="calibre_link-2024" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">82</a></small></sup> Gu Yanwu, quoting the <i class="calibre9">Lunyu</i> (Analects), says, “In your conduct let there be some things that you are ashamed to do; in your studies make use of the widest range of sources.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1904" id="calibre_link-2025" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">83</a></small></sup> By separating morality and knowledge in such a neat way, he actually reduces the problem of Neo-Confucian pan-moralism to a matter strictly of personal ethics. Needless to say, it was his emphasis on erudition that received the closest attention of his latter-day followers.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1905" id="calibre_link-2026" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">84</a></small></sup> Wang Fuzhi <span>王</span><span>夫</span><span>之</span> (1619&ndash;1692), to cite one more example, in his commentary to Zhang Zai’s <i class="calibre9">Zhengmeng</i> <span>正</span><span>蒙</span> (Correcting Youthful Ignorance) stresses that intellectual knowledge is a vital aid to our moral mind.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1906" id="calibre_link-2027" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">85</a></small></sup> He even reminds us of Immanuel Kant when he maintains that while knowledge begins with the senses, man nevertheless possesses a faculty of a priori knowledge (<i class="calibre9">dexing ziyu xuewen</i> <span>德</span><span>性</span><span>資</span><span>於</span><span>學</span><span>問</span>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1907" id="calibre_link-2028" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">86</a></small></sup> Little wonder that a century later, Dai Zhen should insist that man’s moral nature feeds itself on scholarship and knowledge.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1908" id="calibre_link-2029" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">87</a></small></sup> Dai’s sage is not simply a man of moral perfection, for before the sage can bring himself to moral perfection, he must be a perfect scholar, a man of perfect wisdom.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1909" id="calibre_link-2030" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">88</a></small></sup> The growth of classical philology during the Qing can therefore, I believe, be better understood in this broad context of the rising importance of Confucian intellectualism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The growing importance of intellectual knowledge in Neo-Confucian thinking, the revival of philological interest among Confucian scholars, including metaphysicians, and the ever-deepening philological involvement of Neo-Confucian philosophical discussions&mdash;these are all sure signs that at the turn of the seventeenth century, a fundamental intellectual transformation was taking place within Neo-Confucianism. It is this transformation that eventually takes Neo-Confucian development to its third and final stage during the Qing Period, when Confucian classical texts met the most systematic critical reexamination on a scale larger than during any period in Chinese history, including during the Han.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Since the mid-eighteenth century, Qing classical scholarship has been persistently referred to as “philology” (<i class="calibre9">kaoju</i> or <i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i>)<i class="calibre9">.</i> Yet the Qing classicists were not at all happy with this descriptive term, for it tended to suggest that the kind of textual studies they carried out so wholeheartedly had no direct bearing on the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. Jiao Xun <span>焦</span><span>循</span> (1763&ndash;1820), for instance, strongly protested the term. Like Gong Zizhen, he preferred the much more elegant and dignified appellation “classical scholarship.” To call it “philology,” in his opinion, was to miss the point entirely that Qing classical studies sought ultimately to elicit the original meanings hidden beneath literal significance of the sages’ words.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1910" id="calibre_link-2031" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">89</a></small></sup> Such, therefore, was the Qing classicists’ self-image regarding the specific role they played in the history of Confucianism. Unfortunately, Jiao Xun’s protest seems to have never been seriously heeded. Modern interpretations of Qing intellectual history generally emphasize the philological distinctiveness of Qing classicism, whereas the professed dedication of the classicists to the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is often ignored as if it were mere cosmetics. As a result, the whole development of Qing classical and historical studies is seen, essentially, as a methodological movement whose intellectual ties with the Confucian tradition, if not severed, became too loose to be of much significance. I must admit that there is indeed much in the Qing philological development that lends support to such a view. As Benjamin I. Schwartz has aptly explained it: “Even if such pioneers as Hui Dong and Yen Ruoju continued to regard learning as a means to the achievement of ethical and political insights, their method led them elsewhere. It soon came to have a fascination all its own.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1911" id="calibre_link-2032" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">90</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2470" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>On the other hand, however, a purely philological interpretation of Qing Confucianism has two apparent faults. First, it obscures the Confucian philosophical background of Qing classical and historical scholarship, and consequently, overlooks the inner logic of the fundamental intellectual transformation of the seventeenth century. Second, while this interpretation is applicable to many individual cases in which the philologist was so absorbed in his textual problems that he forgot completely the original purpose of his intellectual undertaking, it nevertheless cannot give a satisfactory account of the very course of development that Qing philology took as a learned movement. In particular, this interpretation creates insurmountable difficulties in placing the two leading philosophical spokesmen of Qing classical and historical scholarship, Dai Zhen and Zhang Xuecheng, in their proper historical perspectives.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In their insistence on a return to the original classical sources for purification of the Confucian tradition and in their philological crusade against empty metaphysical speculation, the Qing scholars resemble to an amazingly high degree the Christian humanists of the Renaissance and Reformation, especially Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus of Rotterdam. Indeed, the Qing scholars also shared many other basic assumptions with the humanists, including erudition as the sure basis for faith,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1912" id="calibre_link-2033" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">91</a></small></sup> the necessity of philological probing for bringing to light a text’s true meanings,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1913" id="calibre_link-2034" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">92</a></small></sup> and, above all, scholarship as (in the case of the Qing classicists) a Confucian calling. It is in such terms as these that I propose to redefine Qing philology as the last phase of Neo-Confucianism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the attempt at a new periodization outlined above, I have set forth my own interpretation of the nature and development of Neo-Confucianism from the early Song to the Qing. This represents merely one intellectual historian’s point of view or emphasis. To conclude, I wish to make more explicit what this point of view or emphasis implies.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1010" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>My central concern is to explain Qing intellectual history against the philosophical background of Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism. In other words, I wish to examine to what extent and in precisely what terms the drastic shift from Ming metaphysical speculation to Qing philology can be understood as an internal intellectual development in the Neo-Confucian context. Therefore, my interpretation has necessarily been based on the inner logic of the development, to the total exclusion of external factors such as the political, social, and economic changes in seventeenth-century China, which figure prominently in many previous studies on the same subject written from points of view different from mine. This does not mean, however, that I subscribe to the obviously impossible view that ideas progress entirely according to their own logic and do not at all respond to outside stimulation. My isolation of purely intellectual developments from other realms of human activities is solely for the purpose of historical analysis. A strictly internal interpretation of intellectual history does not compete for its validity with any of the environmental interpretations, whether they be political, economic, or social. On the contrary, this particular interpretation supplements as well as complements all of them. This point has been amply borne out by Perry Miller’s excellent studies of the New England mind.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1914" id="calibre_link-2035" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">93</a></small></sup> It may be contended that while environmental interpretations can contribute to our understanding of an intellectual movement, in most general terms, internal interpretations alone provide specific answers as to why that movement followed the particular course it actually did. For example, the theory of Manchu suppression may be accepted as a satisfactory explanation of early Qing scholars’ turning from history to classics. But specifically why a particular classical canon was chosen for philological investigation above all the others is a question to which the answer, more often than not, must come from intellectual history itself.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>From the point of view of this study, the whole Neo-Confucian development from the early Song to the Qing involves centrally the problem of knowledge. Neo-Confucianism started with a rigid distinction between moral knowledge and intellectual knowledge but ended with the latter’s supremacy accompanied by what may be called the intellectualization of moral reason. Though primarily a problem of knowledge in the special Confucian sense, this development does involve implications transcending Confucian confines, when conceived on a highly generalized and abstract level. Thus, I choose to see this development mainly in terms of the active tension between intellectualism and anti-intellectualism.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">APPENDIX: INTELLECTUALISM AND ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM IN CHINESE INTELLECTUAL HISTORY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>I shall begin by explaining the two borrowed terms “intellectualism” and “anti-intellectualism” as they are used in my study, and then proceed to sketch a variety of forms that both intellectualism and anti-intellectualism have assumed in Chinese intellectual history.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1027" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>By “intellectualism,” I do not mean any specific philosophical doctrine. The term is used generally to indicate a positive attitude toward intellectual knowledge and scholarly pursuits insofar as their bearings on the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> are concerned. In particular, “intellectualism” places a marked emphasis on the importance of the textual basis for an understanding of the sages’ words. In its extreme form, such as in the case of some Qing philologists, it insists on a literal interpretation of a text to the extent of what may be called the fallacy of etymology, or, perhaps, as a Chan Buddhist would say, “experiencing death right below a character” (<i class="calibre9">si zai zi xia</i> <span>死</span><span>在</span><span>字</span><span>下</span>). On the other hand, the term “anti-intellectualism” is even more elusive and ambiguous, as it has been used in current Western writings. As Richard Hofstadter, an authority on American anti-intellectualism, once remarked: “One reason anti-intellectualism has not even been clearly defined is that its very vagueness makes it more serviceable in controversy as an epithet. But, in any case, it does not yield very readily to definition.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1915" id="calibre_link-2036" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">94</a></small></sup> “Anti-intellectualism” in the context of the present study also refers to an attitude that tends to see <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> as lying in a higher realm than, and therefore beyond the reach of, intellectual knowledge. From this attitude, a different view of the Confucian scriptural tradition is derived. A Confucian subscribing to this view believes that he can meet the minds of the sages without necessarily going through the medium of the sages’ words. And when he finally gets around to the sages’ words&mdash;and this is often unavoidable as long as he professes to be a Confucian&mdash;he relies primarily on his own intuition and refuses to be bound by either the literal significance of a text or an earlier exegesis no matter how authoritative it may be, or both. Since, he would argue, words can never fully convey the inner meanings of messages from the sages, the Six Classics are but dregs or, at best, footnotes to our own mind.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In Chinese intellectual history, both intellectualism and anti-intellectualism can be classified into various types according to different standards. There has been, for instance, a long tradition of what may be called a worldly or vulgar form of intellectualism, which is closely associated with the civil service examination system of the state. The worldly intellectualism can be traced back as far as the Former Han Period, when it became proverbial that “to bequeath a chest full of solid gold to one’s son is not as good as to teach him a Confucian classic.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1916" id="calibre_link-2037" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">95</a></small></sup> Toward the end of the Han, classicists went so far that they often devoted thousands of words to explaining one or two characters in a classical text, or they wrote a million-word commentary to one particular classic. As Ban Gu <span>班</span><span>固</span> (32&ndash;92) rightly observed, it was worldly incentives such as office and emoluments that prompted Confucians to carry the worldly intellectualism to this extreme.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1917" id="calibre_link-2038" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">96</a></small></sup> Intellectualism continued to grow along this line in later periods. When a poem attributed to a Song emperor suggests that beauty, golden mansions, and emoluments are all hidden in books, it must have encouraged numerous people to turn to classical studies.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1918" id="calibre_link-2039" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">97</a></small></sup> Thus, the cult of book learning (<i class="calibre9">dushu</i> <span>讀</span><span>書</span>), which is central to Zhu Xi’s intellectualism, met its most vulgar twist in the hands of those intellectuals whose ultimate goal was worldly success rather than realization of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. It may be noted that Zhu Xi and his true Neo-Confucian followers always insisted that they be clearly distinguished from the worldly intellectualists. In reality, however, a clear-cut distinction between the two kinds of intellectualists was not always easy to maintain. Interaction was bound to happen and a shifting of standpoints occurred from time to time. After all, both types of intellectualists originally studied the same Confucian classics. This probably explains why the question of whether to take the examination or not always posed a difficult problem to Neo-Confucian masters, notably from the time of Zhu Xi to that of Wang Yangming.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1061" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Now, turning to anti-intellectualism, the picture is even more complicated. Strong anti-intellectualistic tendencies were persistently present in both original philosophical Daoism and its reincarnation in Wei-Jin Neo-Daoism. When Laozi talked about “banishing wisdom and discarding knowledge,” he was an open and destructive anti-intellectualist.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1919" id="calibre_link-2040" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">98</a></small></sup> In the <i class="calibre9">Zhuangzi</i> alone, at least four types of anti-intellectualism can be distinguished. When Zhuangzi raises the question as to how can we ever be certain about knowing anything, he may be described as a skeptical anti-intellectualist;<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1920" id="calibre_link-2041" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">99</a></small></sup> when he says, “There is a limit to our life, but to knowledge there is no limit. To pursue what is unlimited with what is limited is a perilous thing,”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1921" id="calibre_link-2042" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">100</a></small></sup> he sounds like a logical anti-intellectualist; when he suggests that the fish trap should be forgotten when fish are caught and words should be forgotten when ideas are apprehended,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1922" id="calibre_link-2043" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">101</a></small></sup> he may be called a linguistic anti-intellectualist; and finally, when he speaks of the wordlessness beyond the realm of words and the nonknowledge beyond the realm of knowledge, he becomes a transcendental anti-intellectualist.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1923" id="calibre_link-2044" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">102</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In Neo-Daoism, an important battle between intellectualism and anti-intellectualism was fought at the linguistic level. Living in the first quarter of the third century, Xun Can <span>荀</span><span>粲</span> made the following famous remark about Confucian classics: “Zigong said that the Master’s discussion of human nature and Heavenly Way cannot be heard. Therefore, although the Six Classics have been preserved, they are no more than dregs of the Sage.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1924" id="calibre_link-2045" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">103</a></small></sup> The analogy of the classics to dregs is, of course, traceable to earlier Daoist writings such as the <i class="calibre9">Zhuangzi</i><sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1925" id="calibre_link-2046" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">104</a></small></sup> and the <i class="calibre9">Huainanzi</i> <span>淮</span><span>南</span><span>子</span>,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1926" id="calibre_link-2047" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">105</a></small></sup> but in Xun Can’s formulation, we find the earliest clear expression of the idea that the classics are not necessarily the reservoir of Confucian truths&mdash;an idea that later influenced Neo-Confucian anti-intellectualists, notably Chen Xianzhang. The immediate implication of this idea, however, was rather limited to the Neo-Daoist philosophical discussion of the relations between “words” (<i class="calibre9">yan</i> <span>言</span>) and “ideas” (<i class="calibre9">yi</i> <span>意</span>). Neo-Daoist anti-intellectualists generally believed that, on the authority of both the <i class="calibre9">Zhuangzi</i> and the “Xici” <span>繫</span><span>辭</span> (Commentary on the Appended Phrases) in the <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i> <span>易</span><span>經</span> (Classic of Changes),<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1927" id="calibre_link-2048" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">106</a></small></sup> “words do not completely express the ideas of the Sage.” On the other hand, Neo-Daoist intellectualists, also on the basis of the “Commentary on the Appended Phrases,” argued that words are entirely adequate in expressing ideas.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1928" id="calibre_link-2049" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">107</a></small></sup> In the end, however, it was the anti-intellectualistic view that dominated the Neo-Daoist intellectual world. It was also this view that later became amalgamated with the Mahâyâna concept of <i class="calibre9">up</i><span>ā</span><i class="calibre9">ya</i> (“expediency,” for which the Chinese term is <i class="calibre9">fangbian</i> <span>方</span><span>便</span>) and therefore facilitated the development of Buddhist anti-intellectualism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1929" id="calibre_link-2050" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">108</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1257" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Buddhism presents another difficulty in our discussion of intellectualism and anti-intellectualism. In theory, Buddhism, by its reliance on the dialectic as opposed to ordinary logic and by its insistence that the Truth or the Real is knowable only by intuition or transcendental wisdom (<i class="calibre9">prajñ</i><span>ā</span>) as opposed to reason, rejects outright intellectual knowledge and therefore is by definition an anti-intellectualistic system from our point of view.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1930" id="calibre_link-2051" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">109</a></small></sup> The problem is not that simple, however, for when this intuitive philosophy developed into an elaborate and subtle scholasticism, it too turned itself into a kind of intellectualism, although it is intellectualism of a higher, or perhaps we may say, the highest, level. In Tang China, the Consciousness Only (<i class="calibre9">Vijñaptim</i><span>ā</span><i class="calibre9">tra</i>) school, with its subtle analysis of the eight consciousnesses and fine distinctions of the mind, became precisely such an intellectualism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1931" id="calibre_link-2052" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">110</a></small></sup> Needless to say, it is a kind of philosophy that could have interested only the learned.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>On the other hand, the Tang dynasty also witnessed the rise of the most radical form of Buddhist anti-intellectualism&mdash;Chan or Zen Buddhism. Dr. Hu Shi is certainly justified in calling the Chan movement a “reformation or revolution in Buddhism.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1932" id="calibre_link-2053" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">111</a></small></sup> At least, in the Chan Buddhist emphasis on “pointing directly to the human mind” and “seeing one’s nature and becoming Buddha,” we are reminded of Martin Luther’s salvation by faith alone. A Chan Buddhist may be considered even more radical than Luther, however, on the ground that he rejects not only the church but also the scriptures, whereas, according to Luther, revelation was inseparable from the actual text of Holy Writ so that one was granted God’s grace only after study.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1933" id="calibre_link-2054" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">112</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The general features of Chan Buddhist anti-intellectualism are too well known to require further comment. However, two specific points of historical interest may not be entirely out of place here. First, Chan anti-intellectualism can be better understood against the social background of many of its masters. Beginning with Huineng <span>惠</span><span>能</span> (or <span>慧</span><span>能</span> 638&ndash;713), a large number of Chan Buddhists came from the lower social strata and therefore were nonintellectuals, if not illiterates. It was only natural that they should de-emphasize the intellectual element in Buddhism. This aspect of Chan anti-intellectualism later strengthened the Confucian idea that all men are potential sages, although in the beginning, as shown in the case of Zhu Daosheng <span>竺</span><span>道</span><span>生</span> (ca. 360&ndash;434), the philosophical precursor of Chan Buddhism, the influence may have worked the other way around. A touch of Chan can be detected in the ways in which both Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming saw a sagely virtue in the illiterate.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1401" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Second, the Chan Buddhist theory of transmission of mind without the use of written texts implies the inexpressibility of the First Principle or Truth. While the idea undoubtedly has its independent Buddhist origin, it also strongly suggests a Neo-Daoist influence. As we have just seen, the Neo-Daoist philosophical dispute focused centrally on the problem of the inadequacy of language as a medium of ideas. As early as the fourth century, the philosophic Buddhist monk Zhi Dun <span>支</span><span>遁</span> (314&ndash;366) had already introduced this Neo-Daoist thesis into Buddhism. In his <i class="calibre9">Daxiao pin duibi yaochao xu</i> <span>大</span><span>小</span><span>品</span><span>對</span><span>比</span><span>要</span><span>鈔</span><span>序</span> (Preface to a Selection of Comparative Excerpts from [the Prajñpârmitâ in] the Greater and Smaller [Number of] Chapters), he says: “One must clearly see that-by-which (the Saint) expresses (the Truth in words); one must understand that-by-which he speaks. For when the principles are obliterated (in mystic comprehension) then all words are discarded, and when the (idea) of Enlightenment has been forgotten, then Wisdom is complete.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1934" id="calibre_link-2055" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">113</a></small></sup>Here it may be noted that although Zhi Dun’s emphasis is clearly on principles and meanings, his view of the function of language is not totally negative. However, the thesis later took a further anti-intellectualistic turn in the hands of Zhu Daosheng, who says: “Ever since the transmission of the scriptures eastward (to China), their translators have encountered repeated obstacles, and many have been blocked by holding (too narrowly) to the text, with the result that few have been able to see the complete meaning. Let them forget the fish-trap and catch the fish. Then one may begin to talk with them about the Way (Dao).”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1935" id="calibre_link-2056" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">114</a></small></sup> Zhu Daosheng’s linguistic anti-intellectualism, coupled with his theory of sudden enlightenment, must have contributed ideologically to the rise of Chan Buddhism in the Tang.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1936" id="calibre_link-2057" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">115</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Within Confucianism, anti-intellectualism was also built on several different bases. In addition to metaphysical anti-intellectualism, two other types of great political and social significance may be briefly indicated. The first type arises out of the distinction between <i class="calibre9">cai</i> <span>才</span> (talent) and <i class="calibre9">de</i> <span>德</span> (virtue) or <i class="calibre9">cai</i> and <i class="calibre9">xing</i> <span>性</span> (nature), as in the Wei and Jin Period.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1937" id="calibre_link-2058" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">116</a></small></sup> The distinction itself is at least as old as Confucius, but acquired its practical importance in imperial China. It is particularly relevant to the problem of official recruitment. Its earliest institutionalized expression may be found in the two major categories under which the Han government selected people to fill offices&mdash;<i class="calibre9">xiaolian</i> <span>孝</span><span>廉</span> (filial piety and moral integrity) and <i class="calibre9">xiucai</i> <span>秀</span><span>才</span> (fine talent). The general tendency in Chinese history, however, seems to have been a gradual shift of emphasis from “virtue” to “talent” due, to a great extent, to an ever-increasing demand for objectivization of criteria. On the other hand, one of the justifications for the aristocratic claim to office in medieval China (roughly from the third century to the ninth) was “virtue.” The medieval nobility believed that the kind of virtues needed for administration could be cultivated only in good families. Even down to Ming-Qing times, family background was still more or less stressed, as can be seen from the fact that no one would be admitted to the civil service examination until he could show a clear and clean family record. The distinction received further emphasis in Neo-Confucianism. Sima Guang <span>司</span><span>馬</span><span>光</span> (1019&ndash;1086) reopened the discussion of the old problem by restating the Confucian principle, with renewed enthusiasm and vigor, that virtue must be placed before talent as a social and political value.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1938" id="calibre_link-2059" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">117</a></small></sup> The term “talent” of course has a much broader meaning than knowledge or scholarship. Nevertheless, knowledge tends to stand at the center of what constitutes “talent.” This is especially the case when the distinction was applied to the education of women. The proverb widely current in Ming and Qing China, “a woman without talent is a woman with virtue,” actually defines “talent” in terms of literacy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1939" id="calibre_link-2060" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">118</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1382" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The second type of anti-intellectualism stems from the emphasis on practicality and utility. The best Confucian representative of this type in our period is Yan Yuan, who was probably the most thorough and radical anti-intellectualist in the entire history of Confucianism. In modern times, he has been sometimes referred to as a “pragmatist” in Chinese intellectual history. The analogy seems to be somewhat forced and therefore questionable. Nevertheless, in his crusade against intellectualism, and in the fact that he maintained that ideas must be subservient to the successful carrying out of actual affairs, he is certainly comparable to William James, for both men are philosophers of practicality.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1940" id="calibre_link-2061" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">119</a></small></sup> Moreover, Yan Yuan fought intellectualism on two fronts at the same time. Armed with the Confucian idea of <i class="calibre9">yong</i> (“function,” “use,” or “utility”), he launched fierce attacks on both metaphysical speculation on the <i class="calibre9">ti</i> (substance) of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> and bookish knowledge of <i class="calibre9">wen</i> (literature). However, the fate of his “pragmatic” philosophy was doomed as long as he was unable to break through the prescribed limits of Confucianism, for methodologically, he could neither distinguish himself clearly from the kind of moral cultivation that had been practiced by Song-Ming Neo-Confucians, nor keep himself completely uninvolved with the Confucian scriptural tradition, which was being subjected to rigorous philological examination under the rising Confucian intellectualism of the day. To follow the useful distinction suggested by Morton White, we actually see in Yan Yuan an anti-intellectualist and an anti-intellectual combined in the sense that he not only repudiated knowledge acquired through book learning but also considered scholars or intellectuals (<i class="calibre9">dushuren</i> <span>讀</span><span>書</span><span>人</span>) to be completely useless members of society. In this sense, then, his anti-intellectualism transcended the realm of pure thought and can be more fruitfully investigated in close association with an examination of the sociopolitical attitudes toward knowledge and the intellectual in seventeenth-century China.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>From the above review, brief as it is, at least two obvious points come to mind. First, intellectualism and anti-intellectualism in Chinese history can be studied from a number of angles, ranging from the intellectual and religious to the political and social. Each study should by no means be confined to the kind of distinction I have chosen to maintain in this study. Second, all these types of intellectualism and anti-intellectualism, though distinguishable in conception, are not always separable in historical reality. Interaction between them is but a matter of course. Various kinds of anti-intellectualism often reinforced each other, as did intellectualism of different origins, for although in my study I tend to see the conflict between intellectualism and anti-intellectualism mainly as an internal development of Neo-Confucian thought, this does not mean that the development can be understood in complete isolation from other non-Confucian or even nonintellectual forces.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1042" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It must be further noted that both intellectualism and anti-intellectualism as two contrasting attitudes may be more meaningfully understood in relative rather than absolute terms. As a matter of fact, we rarely find them in pure forms, and in many of the border cases, it is even difficult to draw a strict line. Moreover, in applying the distinction to individual thinkers, it is particularly important that we be very clear about the levels at which or realms in which we classify a person as an intellectualist or anti-intellectualist, for the same person could be both at different levels or in different realms. Although Zhu Xi is undoubtedly a Confucian intellectualist at the level of “following the path of inquiry and study,” at the higher level of “honoring the moral nature,” he also shows anti-intellectualistic tendencies. Wang Yangming probably would have had a much stronger case had he argued for Zhu Xi’s “Dinglun” <span>定</span><span>論</span> (Final Conclusions) in terms of levels of thought rather than stages of life. Tertullian’s Christian anti-intellectualism also makes better sense in the realm of philosophy than in that of theology, for the reason he derides is that of the philosophers, whereas in defending faith and understanding Scripture, he still resorts to reason.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1941" id="calibre_link-2062" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">120</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The various modifications made above, I hope, will suffice to indicate the immense complexities that are necessarily involved in any attempt at making a meaningful distinction between intellectualism and anti-intellectualism in Chinese intellectual history. In this connection, I could not agree more with Isaiah Berlin’s remarks about the famous distinction he makes between the hedgehog and the fox. Of course, like all overly simple classifications of this type, the dichotomy becomes, if pressed, artificial, and ultimately, absurd. However, if it is not an aid to serious criticism, neither should it be rejected as being merely superficial or frivolous; like all distinctions that embody any degree of truth, it offers a point of view from which to look and compare, a starting point for genuine investigation.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1942" id="calibre_link-2063" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">121</a></small></sup></span></div>

The distinction in no way involves a value judgment as to which one is “better.” I am inclined to think, however, that the narrow concept can claim a greater validity in the study of the history of philosophy, whereas the broad concept suits the intellectual history approach much better. In fact, the broad concept has been adopted by several intellectual historians in modern times.

(Many of these Confucian ideals may be conveniently found in <i class="calibre9">Zhongguo datong sixiang ziliao</i> <span>中</span><span>國</span><span>大</span><span>同</span><span>思</span><span>想</span><span>資</span><span>料</span> [Beijing: Zhonghua, 1959].) At the same time, however, I am keenly aware of the dominant modern view since the May Fourth Movement, which, in a variety of ways, stresses the central point that Confucianism (including Neo-Confucianism) since the Han dynasty was established as the ideological orthodoxy in China and functioned as an official tool of the government. That this view is built on the basis of a hard historical fact can hardly be denied, but I wish to contend that the continuity of a Confucian idealistic tradition in premodern China is an equally hard historical fact, to which due recognition must also be given. On this point, see the illuminating discussion of Wm. Theodore de Bary in “Some Common Tendencies in Neo-Confucianism.”</span></div>
<div class="footnote-i"><span>Huang Tsung-hsi’s <i class="calibre9">Mingyi daifang lu</i> <span>明</span><span>夷</span><span>待</span><span>訪</span><span>錄</span> (A plan for the prince), for instance, is clearly a signal of withdrawal before return. The title literally suggests something like “a memorandum written during darkness before dawn with the expectation of a call from a prince.” The term <i class="calibre9">Mingyi</i> is originally the name of a hexagram in the <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i>. In his preface, Huang Zongxi uses the expression <i class="calibre9">Ming er wei Rong</i> <span>明</span><span>而</span><span>未</span><span>融</span> (“Brightness not fully developed”), which is a reference, not to the <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i> directly, but to the <i class="calibre9">Zuozhuan</i> <span>左</span><span>傳</span>. According to an entry in the fifth year of Duke Zhao <span>昭</span><span>公</span> (536 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>), someone consulted the <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i> and got the hexagram <i class="calibre9">Mingyi</i>, which then became <i class="calibre9">Qian</i> <span>謙</span> (also a hexagram). It was explained that “<i class="calibre9">Mingyi</i> becoming <i class="calibre9">Qian</i> represents brightness, but that which is not fully developed&mdash;corresponding, we may presume, to the early dawn” <span>明</span><span>夷</span><span>之</span><span>謙</span>, <span>明</span><span>而</span><span>未</span><span>融</span>, <span>其</span><span>當</span><span>旦</span><span>乎</span> (translation by James Legge, <i class="calibre9">The Ch</i>’<i class="calibre9">un Ts</i>’<i class="calibre9">ew</i>, <i class="calibre9">with the Tso Chuen</i>, <i class="calibre9">Chinese Classics</i>, 5:604). It is interesting to find that Gu Yanwu also uses the same historical allusion in a poem written for a Ming loyalist friend, in which he says <i class="calibre9">Mingyi yu weirong</i> <span>明</span><span>夷</span><span>猶</span><span>未</span><span>融</span> (“<i class="calibre9">Mingyi</i> is not yet fully developed”). <i class="calibre9">Gu Tinglin shiwen ji</i> <span>顧</span><span>亭</span><span>林</span><span>詩</span><span>文</span><span>集</span> (Shanghai: Zhonghua, 1959), 304. Moreover, in another poem (“Chunyu,” <span>春</span><span>雨</span>), Gu has the line <i class="calibre9">Qiong jing dai houwang</i> <span>窮</span><span>經</span><span>待</span><span>後</span><span>王</span>, meaning, “Study the Classics exhaustively with the expectation that a later prince may find it useful” (ibid., 415). A similar idea may also be found in his letter to Yang Yu <span>楊</span><span>瑀</span> (Ying-shih Yü, “Zhang Xuechen Versus Dai Zhen” <span>雪</span><span>臣</span>, 146). Thus, we can see that both scholars shared exactly the same Confucian feeling of “withdrawal and return” in a historical situation in which external conditions rendered it impossible to make their classical and historical knowledge practically serviceable to society.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1233" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">I</span>n his essay “Zhu and Lu” and its “Postscript,” Zhang Xuecheng <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span> (1738&ndash;1801) made a highly illuminating and original criticism of Dai Zhen <span>戴</span><span>震</span> (1724&ndash;1777) with regard to the latter’s intellectual relationship with Zhu Xi <span>朱</span><span>熹</span> (1130&ndash;1200). Zhang began by pointing out that in terms of intellectual ancestry, Dai was very much in the Zhu Xi tradition, which had all along stressed classical scholarship as a Confucian calling. Since Dai had the advantage of living and working in the heyday of Qing philology, however, it was natural that, technically, he surpassed Zhu Xi in textual studies. Nevertheless, unaware of his own intellectual origins, said Zhang, Dai was not only contemptuous of Zhu Xi philologically, but also declared Zhu Xi to be philosophically out of date.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-760" id="calibre_link-827" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> Zhang’s criticism reveals a profound sense of historical continuity on his part. It clearly suggests that Qing philology may be more reasonably interpreted as an internal development of than a sharp break from the Song-Ming Neo-Confucian tradition.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-761" id="calibre_link-828" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1224" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In this study, however, my investigation will be focused primarily on Dai Zhen’s intellectual relationships with the Zhu Xi tradition. I shall address two specific questions: First, to what extent is Zhang justified in taking Dai to be a true heir of Zhu Xi in the context of mid-Qing intellectual history? Second, in terms of the inner logic of the development of Neo-Confucianism, how are we to account for Dai’s criticism of Zhu Xi’s philosophical system?</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>With regard to the first question, there are indeed several grounds on which Zhang’s point may be established. To begin with, attention may be called to Dai’s geographical background. Dai came from Huizhou, southern Anhui, which also happened to be Zhu Xi’s native prefecture. This was a region where the Zhu Xi tradition had never completely ceased to exist. Especially in the early seventeenth century, owing to the influence of the Donglin Academy, there was a renewed local interest in Zhu Xi. Generally speaking, Zhu Xi studies in this region developed along two lines: On the one hand, Zhu Xi’s thought was carefully reexamined on the basis of his commentaries on the Four Books and the Neo-Confucian handbook entitled <i class="calibre9">Jinsi lu</i> <span>近</span><span>思</span><span>錄</span> (Reflections on things at hand), which he compiled jointly with L<span>ü</span> Zuqian <span>呂</span><span>祖</span><span>謙</span> (1137&ndash;1181); on the other hand, in the realm of classical scholarship, Zhu Xi’s unfinished work on the three Confucian classics of rites (the <i class="calibre9">Yili</i> [Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial], the <i class="calibre9">Liji</i> [Classic of Rites], and the <i class="calibre9">Zhouli</i> [Rites of Zhou]) was continued with the help of the newly sharpened weapon of Qing philology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-762" id="calibre_link-829" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> As we all know, throughout his intellectual career, Dai basically followed these two lines. There can be no doubt that Dai’s lifetime struggle with Zhu Xi’s thought and scholarship must have been shaped by his early exposure to this local tradition. As a matter of fact, we can find many examples in the Qing Period that exhibit the shaping influences of local intellectual traditions on individual scholars. Li Fu’s <span>李</span><span>紱</span> (1673&ndash;1750) defense of Lu Xiangshan <span>陸</span><span>象</span><span>山</span> (1139&ndash;1191) was, to a large extent, related to his geographical origin in Linchuan, Jiangxi, and Zhang Xuecheng’s self-identification with the Wang Yangming <span>王</span><span>陽</span><span>明</span> (1472&ndash;1528) school was, by his own admission, established on account of his Eastern Zhejiang background.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the second place, Dai’s mentor Jiang Yong <span>江</span><span>永</span> (1681&ndash;1762), also from the Huizhou area, was a lifetime devotee of Zhu Xi’s teachings. In 1742, Jiang completed his definitive annotated edition of the <i class="calibre9">Reflections on Things at Hand</i>, which has remained to this day authoritative.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-763" id="calibre_link-830" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup> From 1750 to 1754, Dai studied classical philology and mathematics under Jiang in the local Zhu Xi Academy (Ziyang Shuyuan <span>紫</span><span>陽</span><span>書</span><span>院</span>). Dai’s experience at the academy had a profound influence on his general intellectual outlook. He was convinced by the example of his mentor that in the study of the Confucian classics one must, on the one hand, follow the Han exegetes philologically but, on the other, follow the Song masters, especially Zhu Xi, philosophically.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-764" id="calibre_link-831" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1011" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the third place, the Qing philological movement with its emphasis on “evidential investigation” (<i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i> <span>考</span><span>證</span>) was very much in that part of the Zhu Xi tradition that stressed “following the path of inquiry and study” (<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> <span>道</span><span>問</span><span>學</span>). While more will be said about this point later, it suffices to note here that classical philology is implied in Zhu Xi’s theory of “investigation of things” (<i class="calibre9">gewu</i> <span>格</span><span>物</span>) and “extension of knowledge” (<i class="calibre9">zhizhi</i> <span>致</span><span>知</span>). As a matter of fact, Zhu Xi himself was also a great master in the field of textual and philological studies, and in many ways anticipated the Qing philologists.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-765" id="calibre_link-832" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> He once confided in a friend that he was rather fond of the time-consuming “evidential investigations.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-766" id="calibre_link-833" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> We may say that philological improvement or revision in Confucian classical scholarship is a built-in feature in his intellectualistic system.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Viewed in this way, it is therefore perfectly legitimate for a philosophical follower of Zhu Xi to be at the same time philologically critical of him. During the early Qing, for instance, Yan Ruoju <span>閻</span><span>若</span><span>璩</span> (1636&ndash;1704) openly declared his intention to support Song philosophy with Han philology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-767" id="calibre_link-834" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> Dai also made a similar point in his account of the Zhu Xi tradition in Fujian.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-768" id="calibre_link-835" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> In fact, Yan’s geographical and institutional studies of the Four Books&mdash;<i class="calibre9">Sishu shidi</i> <span>四</span><span>書</span><span>釋</span><span>地</span> (Four Books in four installments)&mdash;which corrected many of Zhu Xi’s errors, were taken as a subtle defense of the Master in the philological form.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-769" id="calibre_link-836" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> Hence, both Jiang Yong’s and Dai’s efforts to bring Zhu Xi philologically up to date must be regarded as very true to the spirit of the Zhu Xi tradition.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Last but not least, contrary to Zhang Xuecheng’s assertion, Dai was very much aware of his intellectual indebtedness to Zhu Xi. In a letter to Shi Jing <span>是</span><span>鏡</span> (courtesy name, Zhongming <span>仲</span><span>明</span>, 1693&ndash;1769) written around 1750, Dai vigorously defended Zhu Xi’s tradition of “inquiry and study” as opposed to the anti-intellectualism of the Lu-Wang school. It reads as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>As I know, the study of classics involves three major difficulties: it is difficult to attain erudition; it is difficult to have insightfulness; and it is difficult to cultivate sophisticated refinement. I certainly do not have them. However, these are the general qualities I set as criteria for scholarly writing.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Some of our forebears such as Zheng Yuzhong (i.e., Zheng Qiao <span>鄭</span><span>樵</span>, 1104&ndash;1162) and Yang Yongxiu (i.e., Yang Shen <span>楊</span><span>慎</span>, 1488&ndash;1559), with their extensive knowledge and good memories, had written housefuls of books. Although they are worthy of the name of erudition, they nevertheless can have no claims to sophisticated refinement.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>There were others who bypassed all these difficulties and claimed that the great Dao can be reached through a shortcut. For example, Lu Xiangshan of Song and Chen Xianzhang <span>陳</span><span>獻</span><span>章</span> (1428&ndash;1500) and Wang Yangming of Ming discarded altogether scholarly discussions and decorated themselves with the good name of “honoring the moral nature” (<i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> <span>尊</span><span>德</span><span>性</span>). But how can anyone apply the name “honoring the moral nature” to one’s theory when it is divorced from “following the path of inquiry and study” (<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>)?<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-770" id="calibre_link-837" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1100" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Obviously, here Dai is taking Zhu Xi’s side in the well-known controversy over the problem of <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> and <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> between Zhu and Lu. As we know, Zhu Xi once admitted to a friend that, in contrast to Lu Xiangshan’s emphasis on “moral nature,” his own teaching was indeed more orientated toward “inquiry and study.” He said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Generally speaking, since the time of Zisi <span>子</span><span>思</span> (492&ndash;431 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>), “honoring the moral nature” (<i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i>) and “following the path of inquiry and study” (<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>) have been the two basic ways in which people are taught to exert themselves. Now, what Zijing (i.e., Lu Xiangshan’s courtesy name) talks about are matters pertaining exclusively to “honoring the moral nature,” whereas in my teaching, I have placed a greater emphasis on “inquiry and study.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-771" id="calibre_link-838" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>However, when Lu learned about Zhu’s remark, he simply retorted by saying, “Since he does not know anything about honoring the moral nature, how can there be inquiry and study in the first place?”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-772" id="calibre_link-839" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> There can be no doubt that in writing this letter, Dai must have had these exchanges between Zhu and Lu in mind, and his last sentence in the above-quoted passage is clearly a rejoinder to Lu on Zhu’s behalf. Moreover, in his early writings Dai not only regarded the Cheng-Zhu school as “philosophically clear and profound”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-773" id="calibre_link-840" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> but also defended it on philological grounds. For example, he followed closely the text of the <i class="calibre9">Daxue</i> <span>大</span><span>學</span> (Great Learning) as emended by Cheng Yi <span>程</span><span>頤</span> (1033&ndash;1107) and Zhu Xi;<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-774" id="calibre_link-841" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> he also made serious efforts to save Zhu Xi from his many difficulties in the study of the <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i> <span>易</span><span>經</span> (Classic of Changes).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-775" id="calibre_link-842" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Now, I must proceed to the second question, which is far more complicated than the first one. As I have shown elsewhere, there was a profound psychological aspect to Dai’s criticism of Zhu Xi.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-776" id="calibre_link-843" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> Here, however, I shall examine the question solely from the point of view of intellectual history. Following some interesting leads in the writings of Zhang Xuecheng, I have proposed to view the Ming-Qing intellectual transition in terms of a shift of emphasis in Neo-Confucianism from the moral element (<i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i>) to the intellectual element (<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>), a transition that eventually led to the rise of Confucian intellectualism in the eighteenth century.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-777" id="calibre_link-844" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> Dai Zhen’s changing attitudes toward the Zhu Xi tradition, I believe, serve particularly well as an illustration of this transition.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Professor Qian Mu <span>錢</span><span>穆</span> (1895&ndash;1990) convincingly demonstrated that Dai did not turn into a philosophical critic of the Zhu Xi tradition until he came under the influence of Hui Dong <span>惠</span><span>棟</span> (1697&ndash;1758), whom he first met in Yangzhou <span>揚</span><span>州</span> in 1757.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-778" id="calibre_link-845" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> It is generally agreed that Dai’s reinterpretation of the key Confucian concept <i class="calibre9">li</i> <span>理</span> in the <i class="calibre9">Mengzi ziyi shuzheng</i> <span>孟</span><span>子</span><span>字</span><span>義</span><span>疏</span><span>證</span> (Commentary on the meaning of terms in Mencius) was profoundly inspired by Hui Dong’s <i class="calibre9">Yi weiyan</i> <span>易</span><span>微</span><span>言</span> (Sublime words of the Classic of Changes).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-779" id="calibre_link-846" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> However, a perusal of <i class="calibre9">Sublime Words of the Classic of Changes</i> reveals that it also contains other embryonic ideas of an intellectualist kind that were to be more fully developed in Dai’s philosophical writings.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-984" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Hui’s intellectualism is nowhere more clearly revealed than in his emphasis on the idea of “accumulation” (<i class="calibre9">ji</i> <span>積</span>), which is derived from Xunzi <span>荀</span><span>子</span> (310?&ndash;230? <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>), the first Confucian intellectualist. In the entry “Shengxue shang ji” <span>聖</span><span>學</span><span>尚</span><span>積</span> (The sagely learning stresses accumulation), Hui quoted from many Confucian texts, including the <i class="calibre9">Xunzi</i>, to show that Confucian learning can be acquired only through gradual accumulation of knowledge.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-780" id="calibre_link-847" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> By implication, this would mean a rejection of all forms of subitism in learning by way of moral intuition including the moderate version of Zhu Xi’s as presented in his emendation of the <i class="calibre9">Great Learning</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-781" id="calibre_link-848" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> In the same manner, Hui set out to offer his new interpretation of the important term <i class="calibre9">yi guan</i> <span>一</span><span>貫</span> (one thread through). Etymologically, he demonstrates that <i class="calibre9">guan</i> always means “accumulation.” The <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> therefore accumulates bit by bit.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-782" id="calibre_link-849" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> He further pointed out that the so-called one is, for Confucius, only the beginning, but for Zhuangzi <span>莊</span><span>子</span> (365&ndash;290? <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>), it is the end. According to Hui, in their reinterpretation of the word “one,” the Song Neo-Confucians actually followed the Daoists not Confucius.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-783" id="calibre_link-850" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> This point, it may be noted, was to receive an emphatic elaboration in Dai.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-784" id="calibre_link-851" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Probably influenced by Hui Dong’s approach, Dai also emphasized the idea of “accumulation” by quoting extensively from the <i class="calibre9">Xunzi</i>. He endorsed without reservation Xunzi’s thesis that “sagehood is obtainable through accumulation.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-785" id="calibre_link-852" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> By “accumulation,” of course, Dai meant “accumulation of learning.” A corollary of this is Dai’s theory that moral perfection can be achieved by man only through a gradual development (<i class="calibre9">kuochong</i> <span>擴</span><span>充</span>) of his intellect (<i class="calibre9">zhi</i> <span>智</span>), by which he is essentially distinguished from animals.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-786" id="calibre_link-853" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1047" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Unlike Hui Dong, however, whose criticism of Song Neo-Confucianism is purely destructive in nature, Dai showed an intrinsic interest in saving Zhu Xi’s intellectualistic system through repair and reformulation. In spite of his very sharp differences with Zhu Xi on some of the concrete philosophical issues such as the bifurcation of <i class="calibre9">li</i> <span>理</span> (principle) and <i class="calibre9">yu</i> <span>欲</span> (desire), it seems that his break from his intellectual ties with the Cheng-Zhu tradition was never complete. There are sufficient indications that he continued to struggle with several basic assumptions in the Zhu Xi system. As shown above, he had been on Zhu’s side concerning the importance of the intellectual element&mdash;<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>&mdash;to Confucian learning. In this regard, his position remained unchanged after the break. It is true that in his <i class="calibre9">Xuyan</i> <span>緒</span><span>言</span> (Preface), he condemned both the Cheng-Zhu and Lu-Wang traditions, but a closer scrutiny of this text shows that he did not condemn the two schools indiscriminately. In his judgment, the two Chengs and Zhu Xi were only guilty of conceptual borrowing from Buddhism, whereas Lu and Wang committed a major crime in bringing Buddhist substance into Confucian thinking. Moreover, when Wang Yangming discussed learning in terms of the substance of <i class="calibre9">liangzhi</i> <span>良</span><span>知</span> (innate moral knowledge), he actually followed Daoist-Buddhist anti-intellectualism by discarding learning altogether.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-787" id="calibre_link-854" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> Even in the famous letter to Peng Shaosheng <span>彭</span><span>紹</span><span>升</span> (courtesy name, Yunchu <span>允</span><span>初</span>, 1740&ndash;1796), which he wrote only about a month before his death, he still repeated the very same statement.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-788" id="calibre_link-855" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup> There can be no doubt that as far as the intellectual basis of Confucian learning was concerned, he differed from the Cheng-Zhu school only in degree, but from the Lu-Wang in kind.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In a highly sensitive and strategically vital area of Neo-Confucian philosophy, it may even be shown that Dai was a true disciple of Zhu Xi until death. As we know, a cornerstone of Zhu Xi’s intellectualistic system is the thesis that knowledge must precede action or practice, though the two always depend on each other for mutual reinforcement.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-789" id="calibre_link-856" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> Later, Wang Yangming had painfully struggled with this thesis in its vulgarized Ming form before he was able to counter it with his own famous formulation, “unity of knowledge and action” (<i class="calibre9">zhixing heyi</i> <span>知</span><span>行</span><span>合</span><span>一</span>), in 1509.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-790" id="calibre_link-857" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup> Dai’s view on this vital question emphatically and persistently follows Zhu Xi. According to him, all heterodox theories share two basic characteristic features: first, they all advocate being without desire (<i class="calibre9">wuyu</i> <span>無</span><span>欲</span>) instead of seeking to prevent our mind from being beclouded (<i class="calibre9">bi</i> <span>蔽</span>);<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-791" id="calibre_link-858" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> second, they all emphasize action or practice without first stressing the importance of knowledge.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-792" id="calibre_link-859" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup> On the other hand, knowledge always takes precedence over action in Confucian learning. As Dai says: “All the words of the sages are but to urge people to seek the most appropriate [principles] so that they may be put into practice. To seek the most appropriate [principles] means that knowledge comes first. In no way does sagely learning ever consist in eliminating selfishness without also seeking to remove beclouding or stressing action without first stressing knowledge.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-793" id="calibre_link-860" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup> It may be noted that Dai took the term “beclouding” (<i class="calibre9">bi</i>) from Xunzi, and following Xunzi’s reasoning to its logical conclusion, he also insisted that there is no other way to clean one’s beclouded intellect than to pursue learning.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-794" id="calibre_link-861" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As a Confucian philosopher, Dai cannot avoid discussing the problem of moral nature. And when he comes to grips with it, his emphasis is always placed on the intellectual foundation of morality. For Dai, the possibility is ruled out that there is a kind of innate moral knowledge independent of intellectual knowledge. As one acquires knowledge from constant inquiry and study, he believes, one’s moral nature will be substantiated day by day. This point is further elaborated as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-990" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Let us make an analogy between man’s physical body and his moral nature. The physical body begins with infancy, and ends up with adulthood. Hence, in the same manner, moral nature begins with unenlightened ignorance and ends up with sagely intelligence. The physical body grows only because it feeds on nutrition from drinking and eating. It increases daily and does not return to its original substance. For the same reason, moral nature also feeds itself on learning and inquiry in order to develop into sagely intelligence. Obviously, it does not return to its original substance, either.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-795" id="calibre_link-862" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>In this way, Dai actually pushed the intellectual element in Neo-Confucianism far beyond its prescribed limits. Peng Shaosheng certainly grasped a most essential point in Dai’s <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> when he specifically pointed out: “What you are saying amounts to asserting that the moral nature is not sufficient to guide us to the Dao, for [moral nature itself] must depend on study and inquiry in order to grow. If so, then moral nature would not be worth honoring anymore.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-796" id="calibre_link-863" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup> Although Zhu Xi said, as quoted earlier, that he had paid more attention to “inquiry and study” in his teaching, this statement must not be taken to mean that he placed knowledge above morality. It was a shared assumption of all Neo-Confucians, irrespective of sectarian differences, that <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> was of primary importance and <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>, secondary. Hence, when asked, Zhu Xi would say that “honoring the moral nature” is the ultimate goal toward which all efforts in the realm of “inquiry and study” must be directed.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-797" id="calibre_link-864" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup> Now, while Dai Zhen did not openly repudiate the Neo-Confucian teaching of “honoring the moral nature,” in redefining the relationship between <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> and <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>, he nevertheless intellectualized moral nature to such a point that it was conceived as an epiphenomenon of study and inquiry. In other words, he transformed the moral-intellectual dualism in the Cheng-Zhu tradition into an intellectual monism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In light of this transformation, we can also better understand his fundamental dissatisfaction with both Cheng Yi’s and Zhu Xi’s overwhelming emphasis on “seriousness” (<i class="calibre9">jing</i> <span>敬</span>) at the expense of “learning” (<i class="calibre9">xue</i> <span>學</span>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-798" id="calibre_link-865" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup> As we know, this dichotomy is a reference to the best-known Cheng-Zhu formula, “Self-cultivation requires seriousness; the pursuit of learning depends on the extension of knowledge.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-799" id="calibre_link-866" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup> “Seriousness” lies exclusively in the moral realm, whereas “learning” constitutes its intellectual foundation. Roughly speaking, they may be analogously compared to piety and learning in the Christian tradition. Dai’s criticism therefore clearly indicates that he was interested in the extension of knowledge to the degree of almost ignoring cultivation of the moral nature. As Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962) rightly points out, this criticism could only be made during the middle Qing, when scholarship came to full fruition.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-800" id="calibre_link-867" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Dai’s discussions of the Confucian polarities between “erudition” (<i class="calibre9">bo</i> <span>博</span>) and “essentialism” (<i class="calibre9">yue</i> <span>約</span>) also shed a good deal of light on his intellectualization of the Cheng-Zhu tradition. Taking issue with Zhu Xi over the interpretation of <i class="calibre9">yiguan</i> (one thread through) in the <i class="calibre9">Lunyu</i> (Analects),<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-801" id="calibre_link-868" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup> he says:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In the search for the Dao, there is a difference between learning from below and reaching [the Dao] above. In the pursuit of learning, there is a distinction between knowing the vestiges and grasping the essence of the Dao<i class="calibre9">.</i> The expression “There is one single thread binding my way (Dao) together” <span>吾</span><span>道</span><span>一</span><span>以</span><span>貫</span><span>之</span> (<i class="calibre9">Analects</i>, 4.15) means that the Dao to be reached above is also the Dao to be learned below.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1282" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>We have the expression “I have a single thread binding it all together” <span>予</span><span>一</span><span>以</span><span>貫</span><span>之</span> instead of “my learning [has a single thread binding it all together]” <span>予</span><span>學</span> (<span>一</span><span>以</span><span>貫</span><span>之</span>) because the earlier appearing [character <i class="calibre9">xue</i> <span>學</span>] is omitted here. This expression therefore means that if one grasps the essence of the Dao, then one’s mind becomes so penetrating that it is no longer necessary to go through all the trouble to know its (i.e., the Dao’s) vestiges…. The <i class="calibre9">Analects</i> says: “Use your ears widely but leave out what is doubtful; repeat the rest with caution…. Use your eyes widely and leave out what is hazardous; put the rest into practice with caution” (2.18). Again, “I use my ears widely and follow what is good in what I have heard; I use my eyes widely and retain what I have seen in my mind. This constitutes a lower level of knowledge” (7.28). And again, “I was not born with knowledge, but, being fond of antiquity, I am quick to seek it” (7.20). These statements indicate that [Confucius] did not discard extensive learning.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Although the range of knowledge must be wide, the most important thing is to be able to enlighten the mind. When one comes to investigate a thing, one must do it so thoroughly that there is nothing left in it to be understood. Then one moves on to the next thing and does exactly the same. After a long time, one’s knowing mind becomes so enlightened that it develops into sagely intelligence. [Having reached this point] even things one has not learned can no longer possibly exhaust one’s intelligent mind.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-802" id="calibre_link-869" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">43</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1062" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>There are several important points to be noted in this passage. First, Dai refused to accept the Song conception of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> or <i class="calibre9">li</i> as a metaphysical entity, which stood in a different order from learning. To him, the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> and learning are different in degree but not in kind. To say that “the Dao to be reached above is also the Dao to be learned below” suggests strongly that inquiry and study form the only sure basis of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. This is remarkably consistent with his intellectual monism discussed above. Second, it is interesting that in order to force such a conclusion, he did not even hesitate to violate a basic rule in philology by resorting to a textually unfounded emendation: his suggested reading for “I have a single thread binding it all together” as “My learning [has a single thread binding it all together]” is a philosophical point, but philologically, it is very unconvincing.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-803" id="calibre_link-870" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">44</a></small></sup> Third, in his statement “although the range of knowledge must be wide, the most important thing is to be able to enlighten the mind,” we find a new definition of the relationship between “erudition” and “essentialism” that is uniquely his own. It can be readily seen that “essentialism” (<i class="calibre9">yue</i>) with Dai, like with Zhang Xuecheng, is intellectualized.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-804" id="calibre_link-871" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">45</a></small></sup> However, unlike Zhang’s “systematization” or “theorization,” Dai defined <i class="calibre9">yue</i> in terms of the knowing mind. Being a classical philologist, Dai of course was also aware of the fact that <i class="calibre9">yue</i> in early Confucian texts had a dominant moral character, meaning “to grasp what is morally essential.” To solve this difficulty, he made an ingenious distinction between two kinds of “essentialism”: what is essential with respect to acting (<i class="calibre9">xing</i> <span>行</span>) is cultivation of the person (<i class="calibre9">xiushen</i> <span>修</span><span>身</span>) and what is essential with respect to knowing (<i class="calibre9">zhi</i> <span>知</span>) is to enlighten the mind. In neither case, he concluded, is there a single abstract metaphysical entity to be grasped or known.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-805" id="calibre_link-872" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">46</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Understood in this light, the term <i class="calibre9">xiushen</i> (cultivation of the person), as he came to use it, must not be confused with what Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi called “self-cultivation depends on seriousness,” for Dai’s whole intellectual system admits of no innate moral principle, which Song-Ming Neo-Confucians believed to be not only identifiable with man’s nature or mind but, more important, attainable only through intense spiritual cultivation. <i class="calibre9">Xiushen</i> in the context of Dai’s thought therefore concerns Confucian morality only to the extent that morality is understood as no more than personal ethics. Here Dai’s distinction between two kinds of “essentialism” reminds us very much of Gu Yanwu <span>顧</span><span>炎</span><span>武</span> (1613&ndash;1682)’s separation of knowledge and morality.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-806" id="calibre_link-873" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">47</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Finally, we must relate Dai’s intellectualism to his redefinition of the key Neo-Confucian concept of <i class="calibre9">li</i>, or “principle,” in terms of the “internal texture of things” (<i class="calibre9">tiaoli</i> <span>條</span><span>理</span>), a redefinition firmly established on the philological basis, and, as is generally known, central to his philosophical system. Applied to the realm of human affairs, <i class="calibre9">li</i> is therefore no longer antithetical to “desires” (<i class="calibre9">yu</i> <span>欲</span>) or “feelings” (<i class="calibre9">qing</i> <span>情</span>) as had been traditionally held, but the legitimate satisfaction of “desires” or proper channelization of “feelings.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-807" id="calibre_link-874" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">48</a></small></sup> Modern scholars are certainly justified in stressing the importance of the profound political and social implications of Dai’s theory of <i class="calibre9">li</i>. From the point of view of this study, however, I would like to contend that the originality of Dai’s reinterpretation consists essentially in his intellectualization of the concept of <i class="calibre9">li</i> in the Cheng-Zhu tradition in a way that is remarkably similar to Zhang Xuecheng’s intellectualization of Wang Yangming’s <i class="calibre9">liang-zhi</i>. Throughout his <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>, he emphatically rejected the orthodox Neo-Confucian view that took <i class="calibre9">li</i> to be a completely self-sufficient metaphysical entity. Specifically, he took issue with Zhu Xi’s definition of <i class="calibre9">li</i> “as if it were a thing, which being obtained from Heaven, becomes embodied in the mind.” According to his analysis, subscription to Zhu’s view would logically commit us to anti-intellectualistic conclusions, for if <i class="calibre9">li</i> is a completely self-sufficient entity, then it does not need anything from learning. This is precisely why learning, he argues, can find no place in Buddhism and Daoism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1049" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming were also consistent when they talked about the recovery of man’s original moral mind, or <i class="calibre9">liangzhi</i>, to almost the total exclusion of intellectual knowledge. What seems to have bothered Dai most profoundly is Zhu Xi’s bifurcation between <i class="calibre9">li</i> and <i class="calibre9">qi</i> <span>氣</span> as well as between “seriousness” (<i class="calibre9">jing</i>) and “learning” (<i class="calibre9">xue</i>)<i class="calibre9">.</i> To Dai, the Cheng-Zhu tradition on the whole followed the main stream of Confucian intellectualism. However, the presupposition of <i class="calibre9">li</i> as a completely self-sufficient entity had forced both Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi, especially the latter, to separate <i class="calibre9">li</i> categorically from <i class="calibre9">qi</i>, and consequently, place <i class="calibre9">li</i> in a realm beyond the reach of ordinary learning. Thus, in their search for this metaphysical entity (the so-called <i class="calibre9">benti</i> <span>本</span><span>體</span>, or “original substance”), which Dai took to be nonexistent, they eventually had to resort to the a priori introspective method known as exercising “seriousness.” This led to the upset of the original equilibrium between the moral and the intellectual elements of the Cheng-Zhu system as implied in the formulation “Self-cultivation requires seriousness; the pursuit of learning depends on the extension of knowledge.” To quote Dai himself, “there has been too much discussion on seriousness and too little on learning” in the Cheng-Zhu tradition. In short, Dai saw the concept of a self-sufficient <i class="calibre9">li</i> as an incongruous foreign body in Confucian intellectualism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-808" id="calibre_link-875" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">49</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To remove this inner inconsistency from the Cheng-Zhu system, Dai therefore proposed to redefine <i class="calibre9">li</i> as the “internal texture of things.” According to his final and definitive view, “seriousness” is entirely irrelevant to the quest for <i class="calibre9">li</i>. To be “serious” does not in any way help one to discover <i class="calibre9">li</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-809" id="calibre_link-876" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">50</a></small></sup> Taking a radically intellectualistic position as Dai did, this conclusion is perhaps inevitable, for since <i class="calibre9">li</i> is no longer taken as a self-sufficient metaphysical entity that “man acquires from Heaven and holds in mind,” it then follows that <i class="calibre9">li</i> cannot be grasped through an inner vision of a moral kind resulting from exercising “seriousness.” On the positive side, Dai’s <i class="calibre9">li</i> is fundamentally intellectual in nature and as such is discoverable only by way of “learning.” By clinging to his philological definition of <i class="calibre9">li</i> as the “internal texture of things,” Dai wittingly transformed this key Neo-Confucian idea from a priori moral principles that transcend, and yet also give shape and meaning to things, to immutable laws or patterns that are inherent in things. Little wonder, then, that Dai emphatically stated, “With regard to the <i class="calibre9">li</i> of things, they can be found only after things are analyzed with utmost minuteness.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-810" id="calibre_link-877" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">51</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Such a transformation strengthened Confucian intellectualism in at least two essential ways. First, it restored knowledge to its rightful central importance in Confucian learning, for the discovery of the “internal texture of things” must of necessity presuppose the possession of an objective knowledge of things with utmost minuteness. Second, it reestablished gradualism as a guiding methodological principle in Confucian learning because if <i class="calibre9">li</i>, or principles, do not reside in the mind but exist objectively in each and every thing in the external world, it then follows that the search for a knowledge of them can only be an accumulative enterprise.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1378" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Dai’s intellectualization of <i class="calibre9">li</i> may further be seen in an important distinction he made between what is natural (<i class="calibre9">ziran</i> <span>自</span><span>然</span>) and what is necessary (<i class="calibre9">biran</i> <span>必</span><span>然</span>). In his <i class="calibre9">Yuanshan</i> <span>原</span><span>善</span> (Inquiry Into Goodness), written in 1766, he said: “The desires of nature are the signs of the natural. The virtue of nature is conducive to the attainment of necessity. What is conducive to the attainment of necessity conforms to and perfects what is natural of Heaven and Earth. This is called the utmost attainment of the natural.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-811" id="calibre_link-878" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">52</a></small></sup> Some eleven years later (1777), he maintained the same distinction in his <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>, as follows: “Goodness (<i class="calibre9">shan</i> <span>善</span>) is what is necessary, whereas nature (<i class="calibre9">xing</i>) is what is natural. What is natural will be fully completed only when it is developed into what is necessary. This is what is known as developing the natural to its utmost.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-812" id="calibre_link-879" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">53</a></small></sup> There is no doubt that what Dai calls <i class="calibre9">biran</i> is actually a reference to <i class="calibre9">li</i>, or principles, with emphasis on their moral character. However, at this juncture several interesting questions arise: For example, why did Dai deliberately choose to replace <i class="calibre9">li</i> (moral principles) with <i class="calibre9">biran</i> (moral necessity)? Why must he relate moral necessity to the natural (<i class="calibre9">ziran</i>) and regard the former as “the utmost attainment” of the latter? How will it be possible for the natural to be developed into what is morally necessary?</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The answer to the first question is not far to seek. In his view, the term <i class="calibre9">li</i> as used by Song Neo-Confucian philosophers, including Zhu Xi, suggests that it is an actual entity (<i class="calibre9">shiti</i> <span>實</span><span>體</span>) that “being obtained from Heaven becomes embodied in the mind,” whereas, in fact, it is only an empty name with no independent existence of its own.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-813" id="calibre_link-880" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">54</a></small></sup> By replacing <i class="calibre9">li</i> with <i class="calibre9">biran</i>, Dai obviously hoped to avoid this kind of misunderstanding. In this sense, he may indeed be called a Confucian nominalist. This leads naturally to the second question.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1214" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Unlike moral necessity, the natural (<i class="calibre9">ziran</i>) is defined by Dai as “actual entities” which include what he calls “the daily activities in human relations” (<i class="calibre9">renlun riyong</i> <span>人</span><span>倫</span><span>日</span><span>用</span>), that is, the actualities of life. But the actualities of life are what man shares in common with other animals. Man is distinguished from animals by the fact that he alone can discern in the natural what is morally necessary and direct the former to the latter. Since, however, the necessary is the “internal texture” of the natural, the establishment of moral norms for the purpose of guiding “the daily activities in human relations” must therefore be viewed as the completion of the natural, not its destruction. The important point here is rather that moral necessity must be firmly grounded in what is natural. It is in the very nature of man to live in full accord with moral necessity. As a matter of fact, according to Dai, man will lose his naturalness when he follows what is natural in the same way as animals do.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-814" id="calibre_link-881" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">55</a></small></sup> Here we find Dai’s view fundamentally different from those of the Song Neo-Confucian masters, including Zhu Xi, with regard to the relationship between moral order and natural order. For the latter, the entire natural order is governed by <i class="calibre9">li</i> or moral principles, whereas for the former, only the human part of the natural order is moral. Moreover, in Dai’s case, the moral order is perceived to be ultimately patterned after the natural order, not the other way around, as with Song Neo-Confucians. As to the question of how it is possible for the necessary to be developed out of the natural, Dai’s answer is rather simple and straightforward: it depends entirely on the incessant pursuit of knowledge on the part of man. Through inquiry and study, man gradually discovers what is necessary in what is natural and thus establishes moral principles on the basis of this knowledge. It was the sages, however, who possessed a perfect knowledge of what was morally necessary, and it was through the Six Classics that this knowledge has been transmitted from generation to generation.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-815" id="calibre_link-882" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">56</a></small></sup> The study of the classics is thus fully justified as a Confucian calling. Dai’s position as a Confucian intellectualist is perhaps nowhere more clearly revealed than in this area of his thought.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-816" id="calibre_link-883" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">57</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>By way of conclusion, I would like to turn to Zhu Xi’s classical formulation of the investigation of things (<i class="calibre9">gewu</i>) and the extension of knowledge (<i class="calibre9">zhizhi</i>) for comparison and contrast. Only through such comparison and contrast, I believe, can we expect to grasp the real significance of Dai’s intellectualization of the Zhu Xi tradition. In a famous “Supplement” to a supposedly missing passage in the <i class="calibre9">Great Learning</i>, Zhu Xi said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>If we wish to extend our knowledge to the utmost, we must investigate the principles (<i class="calibre9">li</i>) of all things we come into contact with, for the intelligent mind of man is certainly formed to know, and there is not a single thing in which its principles do not inhere. It is only because all principles are not investigated that man’s knowledge is incomplete. For this reason, the first step in the education of the adult is to instruct the learner, in regard to all things in the world, to proceed from what knowledge he has of their principles, and investigate further until he reaches the limit. After exerting himself in this way for a long time, he will one day achieve a wide and far-reaching penetration. Then the qualities of all things, whether internal or external, the refined or the coarse, will all be apprehended, and the mind, in its total substance and great functioning, will be perfectly intelligent.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-817" id="calibre_link-884" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">58</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>It can be safely assumed that Dai must have had this “Supplement” in mind in particular when he wrote, as quoted previously:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Although the range of knowledge must be wide, the most important thing is to be able to enlighten the mind. [When one comes to investigate] a thing, one must do it so thoroughly that there is nothing left in it to be understood. Then one moves on to the next thing and does exactly the same. After a long time, one’s knowing mind become so enlightened that it develops into sagely intelligence. [Having reached this point], even things one has not learned can no longer possibly exhaust one’s intelligent mind. (See <a href="#calibre_link-802" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">note 43</a>.)</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1383" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Insofar as Dai advocated that one must investigate things exhaustively one after another, he was closely following the teaching of Zhu Xi, but insofar as he refrained from talking about the experience of a “sudden enlightenment” in which “the mind becomes perfectly intelligent in its total substance and great functioning,” he was consciously pushing his methodological gradualism to its logical conclusion. From his intellectualistic point of view, it is inconceivable that in learning one can ever reach a point at which one’s knowledge of all the multitude of things, external or internal, refined or coarse, becomes complete. Here Dai’s break with Zhu Xi may be explained on several grounds.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the first place, Dai did not believe, as Zhu Xi apparently did, that there is a single unitary Principle (<i class="calibre9">li</i>) that lies scattered through all things. On the contrary, <i class="calibre9">li</i>, for him, is essentially an analytical concept. He insisted, on etymological grounds, that <i class="calibre9">li</i> must be understood in terms of <i class="calibre9">fen</i> <span>分</span>, or “distinctions,” which, needless to say, is very much in keeping with his definition of <i class="calibre9">li</i> as the “internal texture of things.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-818" id="calibre_link-885" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">59</a></small></sup> To understand <i class="calibre9">li</i> therefore means to make distinctions “among things.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-819" id="calibre_link-886" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">60</a></small></sup> Moreover, “since each individual thing has its <i class="calibre9">li</i>, then <i class="calibre9">li</i> must of necessity vary from one thing to another.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-820" id="calibre_link-887" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">61</a></small></sup> Such being the case, our quest for <i class="calibre9">li</i> can only be a gradual cognitive process and the moment of sudden enlightenment as described by Zhu Xi would never arrive.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the second place, according to Dai’s analysis, Zhu Xi’s system also presupposes that “the mind contains all the <i class="calibre9">li</i> with which it responds to all things.” Since things in the external world are of an infinite number, however, it therefore follows that the individual mind must contain an equally infinite number of <i class="calibre9">li</i> in order to respond to things. But the difficulty is: Can we imagine that these many separate <i class="calibre9">li</i> coexist in an individual mind? To solve this difficulty, it is further suggested that all the <i class="calibre9">li</i> in the mind are not really separate, but are differentiations from a single unitary <i class="calibre9">li</i> (<i class="calibre9">liyi fenshu</i> <span>理</span><span>一</span><span>分</span><span>殊</span>, or “principle is one but its manifestations are many”).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-821" id="calibre_link-888" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">62</a></small></sup> From this theory, then, the view can be derived that continuing acquisition of knowledge of <i class="calibre9">li</i> will at some point lead to a sudden enlightenment in which the <i class="calibre9">li</i> of all things in the external world become visible to us within our own nature or mind.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-822" id="calibre_link-889" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">63</a></small></sup> Yet this is precisely the theory Dai rejected because it takes “<i class="calibre9">li</i> as if it were a thing which, being obtained from Heaven, becomes embodied in the mind.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>For Dai, man’s mind possesses no such all-embracing unitary <i class="calibre9">li</i> at all. What distinguishes man from animals is none other than a knowing faculty&mdash;a faculty that grows from a dull beginning to full maturity as it gradually feeds itself on knowledge of things in the external world. Therefore, although Dai used a language very similar to Zhu Xi’s in describing the mind going through a long period of “investigation of things,” the kind of mind he hoped to develop is fundamentally a well-cultivated knowing mind, with which things yet to be investigated can be dealt with most effectively; it differs decidedly from the kind of mind as conceived by Zhu Xi, which is marked by a complete possession of all the a priori principles of things.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1219" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Finally, in the third place, with all the emphasis Zhu Xi placed on the extension of knowledge, he is, in contrast to Dai, no more than a halfway intellectualist. To him, the pursuit of learning is meaningful only if it is carried out under the frame of reference of “honoring the moral nature.” Therefore, what he speaks of as “the perfectly intelligent mind in its total substance and great functioning”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-823" id="calibre_link-890" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">64</a></small></sup> must be understood essentially in terms of man’s search for the knowledge of his inner moral nature. By no means can his “investigation of things” and “extension of knowledge” be construed as directed primarily toward the objective knowledge of the external world.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The case with Dai Zhen is somewhat different, however. I would certainly hesitate to join Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929) in suggesting that Dai pursued knowledge for the sake of knowledge.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-824" id="calibre_link-891" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">65</a></small></sup> Nevertheless, as keenly observed by Gong Zizhen <span>龔</span><span>自</span><span>珍</span> (1792&ndash;1841), the Qing period was an age in which Confucian intellectualism (<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>) reigned supreme.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-825" id="calibre_link-892" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">66</a></small></sup> With the rise and development of the mid-Qing philological movement of which Dai was the foremost philosophical spokesman par excellence, the Neo-Confucian idea of “honoring the moral nature” was gradually relegated to the background. As a result, Dai’s view of the relationship between morality and knowledge differed markedly from that of Zhu Xi. In Dai’s philosophical system, man’s knowledge of the principles (<i class="calibre9">li</i>) of things, including moral principles, never ceases to grow as it continually feeds itself on inquiry and study. The traditional distinction between intellectual knowledge and moral knowledge, or between “learning” and “seriousness,” was no longer meaningful to Dai, who saw morality to be none other than a product of knowledge.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-826" id="calibre_link-893" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">67</a></small></sup></span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1177" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">D</span>ai Zhen <span>戴</span><span>震</span> (1724&ndash;1777) presents two entirely different images in the intellectual history of the mid-Qing Period: that of a classical philologist and that of a Confucian philosopher. During his own time, it was Dai the philologist who received universal recognition in the scholarly world. On the other hand, Dai the philosopher was largely ignored or even denounced by his contemporaries. Zhang Xuecheng’s <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span> (1738&ndash;1801) great appreciation of Dai’s philosophical writings was not shared at all by such common friends as Zhu Yun <span>朱</span><span>筠</span> (1729&ndash;1781) and Shao Jinhan <span>邵</span><span>晉</span><span>涵</span> (1743&ndash;1796). In modern times, it is largely owing to the efforts of such scholars as Zhang Binglin <span>章</span><span>炳</span><span>麟</span> (1869&ndash;1935), Wang Guowei <span>王</span><span>國</span><span>維</span> (1877&ndash;1927), Liu Shipei <span>劉</span><span>師</span><span>培</span> (1884&ndash;1919), Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929), and Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962) that Dai the philosopher has become the focus of intellectual attention. By contrast, Dai’s philological accomplishments are more often praised than seriously studied, with the notable exception of his collated text of the <i class="calibre9">Shuijing zhu</i> <span>水</span><span>經</span><span>注</span> (Commentary to the Classic of Waterways).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1454" id="calibre_link-1547" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the present study, I propose to examine philosophy and philology as the two basic constituent elements in Dai’s system of Confucian learning. By “philosophy” and “philology,” I refer to what Qing scholars called, respectively, “moral principles” (<i class="calibre9">yili</i> <span>義</span><span>理</span>) and “evidential investigation” (<i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i> <span>考</span><span>證</span> or <i class="calibre9">kaoju</i> <span>考</span><span>據</span>)<i class="calibre9">.</i></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1157" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This study’s emphasis is placed on the development of Dai’s thought during the last two decades of his life when he was, by general suffrage of the scholarly world, the foremost leader of the philological movement. Dai’s involvement in this learned movement is an event of singular importance not only in his own intellectual life, but in the development of the movement as well. While the movement provided Dai with a solid philological foundation on which his philosophical edifice was eventually built, in turn he also helped shape the character of the movement in its mature stage by supplying it with a much-needed philosophical justification.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Dai first came to Beijing in 1754. He had no sooner made his initial contact with academic circles in the capital than he was hailed as the archphilologist of the day. A firsthand account of Dai’s sudden rise to fame is given in Qian Daxin (1728&ndash;1804)’s <i class="calibre9">Zhuting jushi ziding nianpu</i> <span>錢</span><span>大</span><span>昕</span> (Chronological autobiography) as follows:</span></div>

His Excellency Qin Huitian <span>秦</span><span>惠</span><span>田</span> (canonized as Wengong <span>文</span><span>恭</span>) of Wuxi invited me to participate in his <i class="calibre9">Wuli tongkao</i> <span>五</span><span>禮</span><span>通</span><span>考</span> [Comprehensive study of the Five Rites] project. Dai Dongyuan <span>戴</span><span>東</span><span>原</span> of Xiuning <span>休</span><span>寧</span> came to the capital for the first time. He visited me at my residence and we talked all day. I was greatly impressed by the depth and breadth of his learning. The following day, I recommended him to His Excellency, who cordially agreed to take a ride with me to pay Dai a personal visit. His Excellency then praised him on all occasions. Henceforth, Dai’s name was known throughout China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1455" id="calibre_link-1548" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Needless to say, what made both Qian Daxin and Qin Huitian so excited about their discovery of Dai was not the latter’s sophistication in Confucian thinking, but his many-sided accomplishments in the broad field of Qing philology or evidential research, including mathematics, astronomy, historical geography, etymology, and phonology. Hence, when Dai finally accepted Qin Huitian’s invitation to work on the <i class="calibre9">Comprehensive Study of the Five Rites</i> project, he was put in charge of the section on “astronomical calculations.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1456" id="calibre_link-1549" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1230" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Dai’s early public image as an archphilologist remained unchanged until the end of his life; it only continued to grow as his influence in the scholarly world increased with time. In 1773, he was appointed a compiler of the <i class="calibre9">Siku quanshu</i> <span>四</span><span>庫</span><span>全</span><span>書</span> (Complete Library of the Four Branches [SKQS]) project without a <i class="calibre9">jinshi</i> <span>進</span><span>士</span> degree, a fact that fully testifies to his stature as a leading classical philologist. During the period 1773&ndash;1777, when he was working on this project, according to Duan Yucai <span>段</span><span>玉</span><span>裁</span>, works assigned to him for editing fell mainly into the following categories: astronomy, mathematics, historical geography, etymology, and linguistics.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1457" id="calibre_link-1550" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup> In 1755, Dai wrote to a friend that the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> of the sage is to be found in the texts of the Six Classics, which must be subjected to both philosophical and philological analyses. The Han Confucianists were philologically correct but philosophically unsound, whereas the Song Confucianists were philosophically sound but philologically incorrect.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1458" id="calibre_link-1551" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup> The implication is, of course, that it is ideal to be in possession of the virtues of both and the vices of neither. It is clear, however, that in 1777, as in 1754, Dai was respected in academic circles in Beijing only as a classical philologist. Much to his dismay, Dai was never taken seriously by his colleagues as a Confucian philosopher.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1459" id="calibre_link-1552" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Yet during the same period that Dai was philologically active and productive, he was also philosophically creative. He first drafted <i class="calibre9">Yuanshan</i> <span>原</span><span>善</span> (Inquiry Into Goodness) sometime before 1763 and then expanded and revised it in 1766; he wrote <i class="calibre9">Xuyan</i> <span>緒</span><span>言</span> (Preface) in 1769 when he was working on a local history project in Shansi; and he completed <i class="calibre9">Mengzi ziyi shuzheng</i> <span>孟</span><span>子</span><span>字</span><span>義</span><span>疏</span><span>證</span> (Commentary on the meaning of terms in Mencius), his crowning achievement in Confucian philosophy, only a few months before his death. Moreover, it has recently come to light that sometime between 1769 and 1777, he also revised the <i class="calibre9">Preface</i> text and changed its title to <i class="calibre9">Mengzi sishu lu</i> <span>孟</span><span>子</span><span>私</span><span>淑</span><span>錄</span> (A Record of Personal Comments on Mencius), which was later incorporated into the final version of <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1460" id="calibre_link-1553" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> Although Dai was working simultaneously in the fields of philology and philosophy, his philological studies were always enthusiastically received, whereas his philosophical adventures failed to evoke a positive response from his fellow scholars. Zhang Xuecheng gives a vivid description of the situation in 1766 when he was staying with Zhu Yun in Beijing. In “Da Peng Shaosheng shu” (A Letter in Reply to Shao Eryun <span>邵</span><span>二</span><span>雲</span>; Jinhan <span>晉</span><span>涵</span>),” he recalls:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>At that time, it may be remembered, both Mr. Zhu [Yun] of Ta-hsing <span>大</span><span>興</span> and Mr. Qian [Daxin] of Jiading <span>嘉</span><span>定</span> were the two towering figures of highest academic reputation among scholar-officials in the capital. They both admired Dai, but only to the extent of Dai’s penetrating and refined studies in textual criticism, philology, etymology, and mathematics. When it came to Dai’s [philosophical] treatises, such as <i class="calibre9">Yuanshan</i> [Inquiry Into Goodness], they regretted to see [Dai] applying his good self to a field of futility. I argued forcefully in front of Master Zhu, contending that [Dai’s philosophical] theories were indeed the most rewarding part of his textual investigations. Unfortunately, my position was humble and my words carried little weight. None of the esteemed scholars was listening to me.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1461" id="calibre_link-1554" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1097" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>We have reason to believe that after this initial setback, Dai kept his philosophical writings to himself and rarely, if ever, permitted them to be circulated among his unsympathetic colleagues. This is clearly shown in his preface to the final version of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i>, in which he says that he will hide the manuscript in his family library in the hope that someday an able person will come along to appreciate and promote the truth contained therein. Duan Yucai, Dai’s leading disciple, who had copied the first draft of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> in 1763, does not seem to have known about Dai’s other two major philosophical works&mdash;<i class="calibre9">Preface</i> and <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>&mdash;during his master’s lifetime.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1462" id="calibre_link-1555" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In a letter to Wang Niansun <span>王</span><span>念</span><span>孫</span> (1744&ndash;1832), Duan confessed that he did not study the <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> and grasp its central significance until as late as 1810.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1463" id="calibre_link-1556" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> The obscurity of Dai as philosopher in the late eighteenth century can further be seen from the fact that Zhang Xuecheng, who was a great admirer of Dai’s philosophy, never had access to Dai’s later philosophical writings. Indeed, as late as 1790, when Zhang wrote his postscript to the essay “Zhu and Lu,” he still took <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> (most likely the first draft) and two other short pieces on the concept of “nature” to be representative of Dai’s thought.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1464" id="calibre_link-1557" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> We have evidence that Dai only showed <i class="calibre9">Preface</i> to his old schoolmate Cheng Yaotian <span>程</span><span>瑤</span><span>田</span> (1725&ndash;1814) in 1776 and <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> to the Buddhist philosopher Peng Shaosheng <span>彭</span><span>紹</span><span>升</span> (1740&ndash;1796) in 1777, at their request.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1465" id="calibre_link-1558" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> Both Cheng and Peng, it may be noted, were genuinely interested in Neo-Confucian philosophy, although they differed from Dai, each in his own way, in philosophical outlook. At this point, let us pause for a moment and consider two intriguing questions: First, was Dai’s philology related to his philosophy, and, if so, how were they related to each other? Second, were philology and philosophy of equal importance to Dai, or, in terms of Dai’s own ultimate concern, was one of them more fundamental than the other?</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The answer to our first question is quite clear. On many occasions, Dai Zhen explicitly stated that his philology and his philosophy were inseparable. In his letter to Duan Yucai, dated February 21, 1777, Dai wrote:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Since I was seventeen years old, I have set the quest of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> as my life goal. I was convinced that <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> can be found only in the Six Classics and the works of Confucius and Mencius. But unless we study the meanings of the words, institutions, and terminologies [in these classical texts] we will not be able to understand the language of the texts.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1466" id="calibre_link-1559" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Earlier in 1765, he also said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1043" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Alas, if the so-called philosophical ideas [of the sages] can be obtained by sheer speculation apart from the classics, then anyone would be able to grasp them out of emptiness. If that is the case, what do we need classical learning for? It is precisely because sheer speculation cannot lead one to the philosophical ideas of the sages of antiquity that one has to seek them from the ancient classics. Since messages contained in the surviving records have gradually fallen into oblivion due to the expanse of time between the past and the present, one therefore has to seek them through philological studies [of the classics]. Thus, only if philology is clear, can the ancient classics be understood, and only if the classics are understood, can the sages’ philosophical ideas then be grasped.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1467" id="calibre_link-1560" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Hence, for Dai, philology was the foundation and philosophy the superstructure. However, Dai’s conception of philology was different from that of his contemporaries. While most mid-Qing scholars were doing philology on a piecemeal basis, Dai Was promoting what must be called a systematic philology.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As early as 1749, Dai wrote:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>[It is necessary that we] bring the <i class="calibre9">Erya Dictionary</i> to bear on the interpretation of [such classical texts as] the <i class="calibre9">Shijing</i> [Classic of Poetry] and the <i class="calibre9">Shujing</i> [Classic of History] and, conversely, also use the <i class="calibre9">Poetry</i> and the <i class="calibre9">History</i> to authenticate the <i class="calibre9">Erya Dictionary</i>. We should then apply [the philological methods of explication] to all the extant ancient texts of pre-Qin times. Only by systematization through synthesis and analysis, always on the basis of the Six Graphic Principles,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1468" id="calibre_link-1561" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> and phonetics, can we then hope to establish philology on solid ground.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1469" id="calibre_link-1562" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Also around this time, in his much-quoted “Yu Shi Zhongming lunxue shu” (Letter to Shi Zhongming), he further defined his systematic philology: “The meaning of a single character [in a classical text] can be considered as conclusively established only when it is uniformly applicable to all the classics and firmly based on the Six Graphical Principles.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1470" id="calibre_link-1563" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> It is true that already in the seventeenth century, Wan Sida <span>萬</span><span>斯</span><span>大</span> (1633&ndash;1683) had expressed the view that Confucian classical scholarship is of such a unified nature that no single text can be fully understood in isolation from the rest. The entire corpus of Confucian classics must therefore be treated as a closely interrelated system.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1471" id="calibre_link-1564" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> But, obviously, here Wan is only advocating a systematic study of the classics. Qing philology did not come to full maturity until the middle of the eighteenth century. In Wan’s time, the kind of systematic philology Dai Zhen was to promote a century later could hardly have been conceived.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1123" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Central to Dai’s conceptions of systematic philology is the basic assumption that the language in which the sages’ philosophical ideas are expressed is uniform throughout the pre-Qin texts. To what extent this assumption can be regarded as valid is a question that does not concern us here. The point I wish to stress is that it is precisely this assumption that gives an inner unity to philosophy and philology in Dai’s scheme of things. Like Isaiah Berlin’s hedgehog, Dai also related “everything to a single central vision, one system less or more coherent or articulate,” although in his particular case, the “central vision” or the “one system” involved him in two different types of intellectual work&mdash;philology and philosophy. True to his hedgehog nature, however, Dai sought not only to make philosophy and philology systematic within their respective domains, but also to relate these two branches of Confucian learning systematically to the “central vision” of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. This leads directly to our second question, namely, which of the two fields, philosophy or philology, was more fundamental to his central intellectual concern.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>I wish to begin by saying that in spite of his public image as an archphilologist, deep in his heart, Dai Zhen always aspired to become a Confucian philosopher. The best evidence for this is to be found in the profound gratification he expressed each time he was engaged in a major philosophical work. He once told Duan Yucai, “When I completed chapter 1 of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i>, my pleasure was beyond description. I even found food particularly delicious.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1472" id="calibre_link-1565" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> It is understandable why he was so excited about <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i>, his first systematic treatment of a philosophical topic. From his early years to the very end of his life, Dai devoted himself to the study of philology and yet, at the same time, he made every effort to go beyond philology to reach a genuine philosophical understanding of the Confucian Way. Time and time again, he stressed the point that philology was not an end in itself but a means to “hearing the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>” (<i class="calibre9">wen dao</i> <span>聞</span><span>道</span>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1473" id="calibre_link-1566" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> It is probably in the writing of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> that he experienced for the first time the supreme delight of being philosophically enlightened via philology.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1370" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>There is also an extremely revealing piece of information concerning Dai’s state of mind when he was working on <i class="calibre9">Preface</i>, his second major philosophical treatise. In 1772, he reminisced with Cheng Yaotian about when he started writing it in Shanxi in 1769: “When I was staying with Governor [Zhu Gui <span>朱</span><span>珪</span>] in his official residence, for some ten odd days I pretended to be sick. Afterward, I came out and confessed to the Governor that I was not really sick. I was only in a frenzy while trying to smash the Supreme Ultimate Chart of the Song Confucianists.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1474" id="calibre_link-1567" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> A word of explanation is in order. The last phrase, “smash the Supreme Ultimate Chart of the Song Confucianists,” is a reference to his composition <i class="calibre9">Preface</i>. Although his <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> marks a significant departure from the philosophical position of orthodox Song Confucianism, Dai did not push his differences with Song Confucianists to a breaking point in that work.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1475" id="calibre_link-1568" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> As Qian Mu rightly points out, it was in the <i class="calibre9">Preface</i> that he began to attack his Song predecessors openly.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1476" id="calibre_link-1569" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> However, what particularly interests us here is his frenzied state of mind while writing the <i class="calibre9">Preface</i>. This seems to be a clear indication that he was totally immersed in thought during the period of “some ten odd days” of his pretended illness. The actual writing of <i class="calibre9">Preface</i> may have taken much longer, for evidence shows that three years later, in 1772, Dai was still revising this work.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1477" id="calibre_link-1570" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> Nevertheless, we can safely assume that it was during these “ten odd days” in 1769 that his central ideas for it crystallized&mdash;ideas that would eventually take form in <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>. Hence, as far as the development of Dai’s philosophical thought is concerned, the importance of this brief period in 1769 can hardly be exaggerated.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Moreover, Dai’s reminiscence also suggests something psychologically significant. The “pretended illness,” the “frenzy,” and the attempt to “smash the Supreme Ultimate Chart” all point to a powerful psychological experience. When Dai said that he “smashed the Supreme Ultimate Chart,” he was actually saying that he had finally declared war on Song Confucianism. In fact, Dai’s change into a critic of the Cheng-Zhu tradition is traceable to his first meeting with Hui Dong <span>惠</span><span>棟</span> in Yangzhou back in 1757, but his first piece critical of Song Confucianism was not written until 1765. Even then, his criticism was still mild, indirect, and implicit.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1478" id="calibre_link-1571" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup> It took him another four years to declare war openly. In view of his early intellectual background, especially his spiritual adherence to the Cheng-Zhu tradition through the influence of Jiang Yong, Dai’s decision to “smash the Supreme Ultimate Chart” at long last must have been an event of the first magnitude in his life.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1479" id="calibre_link-1572" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Dai’s last, philosophical work&mdash;<i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>&mdash;was completed sometime early in 1777, and, unfortunately, he did not live long enough to leave us a similar statement that would reveal his innermost feelings about this masterpiece. Nevertheless, from his letters to friends we know that he was prouder of it than of any of his other writings. In a letter to Duan Yucai dated May 30, 1777, he spoke of this work thus: “Of all the works I have written, I must take <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> to be my magnum opus. It contains essentials for rectifying the minds of the people. Nowadays everybody, righteous or wicked, mistakenly takes his personal opinion to be what is called <i class="calibre9">li</i> <span>理</span> (principle, or reason) and has thus brought calamity to the populace. I therefore felt compelled to write my <i class="calibre9">Shuzheng.</i>”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1480" id="calibre_link-1573" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup> As we know, Dai’s latest discovery in his <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> was a redefinition of <i class="calibre9">li</i> in terms of both <i class="calibre9">qing</i> <span>情</span> (feelings) and <i class="calibre9">yu</i> <span>欲</span> (desires); this was diametrically opposed to the Cheng-Zhu dichotomy between <i class="calibre9">li</i> on the one hand and <i class="calibre9">qing</i> and <i class="calibre9">yu</i> on the other. He was so excited about his new formulation that during the four months prior to his death on July 1, 1777, he wrote no fewer than five letters to his friends explaining the central significance of his major breakthrough in Confucian philosophy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1481" id="calibre_link-1574" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> There can be no doubt that the completion of his magnum opus gave him an intellectual satisfaction of the highest degree.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1234" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The above analysis shows clearly that philosophy not only occupied Dai’s mind consistently but also engaged his heart. By contrast, philology does not seem to have ever gratified his ego with comparable intensity.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1482" id="calibre_link-1575" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup> This is not to say, of course, that philology was not important to him. I have already pointed out that philology was the very foundation on which his philosophical structure was built. I must also add that Dai was a professional philologist in the sense that most of the time he made his livelihood from philological work. However, the fact remains that throughout the last two decades of his life, he never allowed his professional interest in philology to distract him from his central philosophical vision, the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. In an earlier letter to Duan Yucai dated February 21, 1777, he talked about his future plans:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>It seems that I shall be able to finish my part of the editing work [in the <i class="calibre9">Siku quanshu</i> project] in the coming summer. I have decided to take a leave and return to the south in the seventh or eighth moon so that I may obtain the care of a physician. I wish to find a teaching position in an academy to support myself and will not come out again. I shall devote several years of my life to writing a book elucidating the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> of Confucius and Mencius. If I still have some energy left, I will then edit my previous studies in etymology and the classics.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1483" id="calibre_link-1576" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Obviously, had Dai lived a few years longer, he would have done something more ambitious in the realm of philosophy than the <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>, covering not only Mencius but Confucius as well. Philology on the other hand, as the last sentence unmistakably indicates, became only peripheral to his intellectual concern. Here Dai made his final choice between philosophy and philology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1484" id="calibre_link-1577" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>We have seen that Dai’s public image as an archphilologist was directly contradicted by his self-identity as a Confucian philosopher. It was a contradiction between his inner world and an intellectual environment that not only surrounded him, but of which he was also a part. The importance of this contradiction in Dai’s life cannot be overstressed. As is shown below, the pressures of this intellectual environment of the mid-eighteenth century had generated in Dai a tension of such an enduring nature that he struggled to accommodate it until his death. It seems to me that much of his intellectual development after his arrival in Beijing in 1754, especially the ways in which his philosophic ideas were expressed, needs to be reinterpreted in the light of this tension. For two centuries, this dark corner in Dai’s inner consciousness has remained obscured from the view of those who studied him. No one has ever suspected that during his lifetime the most profound psychological pressures to which Dai the archphilologist was being subjected came from none other than the group of philologists with which he was most intimately associated. Let us begin by examining the nature of these pressures.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In his “Shu Zhu Lu pian hou” (Postscript to Zhu and Lu), Zhang Xuecheng wrote:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1232" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Mr. Dai’s scholarship was profound in etymology and excelled in technical terms and institutions [in the classical texts]. Moreover, he also grasped the very significance of these matters and, on the basis of his scholarship, he was to expound the <i class="calibre9">Dao.</i> But contemporary scholars only valued erudition and philology. Since they saw that Dai’s philological achievement fitted in well with the current fad, they therefore considered this to be Dai’s greatest strength. When Dai wrote his essays “Human Nature” and “Goodness,” in which he truly displayed great originality in the treatment of such philosophical topics as Heaven and Man, <i class="calibre9">li</i> (principle, or reason) and <i class="calibre9">qi</i> (vital force, or matter), these same contemporary scholars then turned to accuse him of talking emptily about philosophy. In their opinion, he could well have saved the trouble of writing such essays. They certainly show no understanding of Dai’s scholarship at all.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1485" id="calibre_link-1578" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup></span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span>From Zhang’s “Letter in Reply to Shao Eryun,” quoted earlier, we know that “contemporary scholars” is a reference to Zhu Yun and Qian Daxin. Elsewhere, Zhang specifically singled out Zhu Yun as a hostile critic of Dai’s adventures in philosophical ideas.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1486" id="calibre_link-1579" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup> Since both Zhu and Qian were among the most influential leaders in the learned movement of philologism of the day, and since they made this attack emphatically as well as repeatedly, it is inconceivable that Dai could have been insensitive to their criticism, much less ignorant of it. In fact, Dai was not only sensitive, he also responded to it actively. However, his response was conveyed in such a subtle and quiet way that it has eluded detection. In what immediately follows, I aim to prove my point through a discussion of his <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> and <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In his preface to the revised and expanded version of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i>, Dai wrote:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Originally, I wrote my treatise <i class="calibre9">Yuanshan</i> in three sections (<i class="calibre9">zhang</i> <span>章</span>). Being afraid that scholars might be biased by a point of view wholly different from mine, I therefore quoted from the Confucian classics to explain and support my argument. In the volume to follow, I place my original three sections, respectively, at the beginning of each of the three chapters (<i class="calibre9">juan</i> <span>卷</span>) into which this volume is divided; these are followed by my quotations from, and comments on, the classics. Since I have compared and combined the meanings of terms in the classics, it should be very clear where the beginning and the end of my reasoning and my purpose lie: an examination of the Way of Heaven and the Way of Man; they present the most fundamental teachings of the classics.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Now that we are separated from the ancient sages by such a long period of time, it is no surprise that students of the classics in our time cannot maintain a systematic view of the teachings or the insights of the ancient sages and that they accept what they usually hear and learn about without discriminating the true from the false. Fearing that my words are not strong enough to retrieve the teachings of the classics from decline, I therefore hide my treatise in my family library in the hope that some able person will discover it and that he will someday promote the truth contained therein.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1487" id="calibre_link-1580" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1220" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The preface contains several important messages that reveal the delicately strained relations between Dai and other leading philologists. First, it tells the reader what motivated its author to revise and enlarge his original version of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i>: he did so in response to scholars “biased by a point of view wholly different” from his. Who were the “scholars” that Dai is talking about in this context? In view of the fact that between 1763 and 1766, the original manuscript of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> circulated only in an extremely limited circle of Dai’s scholarly friends,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1488" id="calibre_link-1581" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup> and that the earliest known criticism of the work came from none other than Zhu Yun and Qian Daxin, we can safely assume that Dai’s “scholars” were, in all probability, not very different from what Zhang Xuecheng referred to in the “Postscript to Zhu and Lu” as “contemporary scholars.” In other words, Dai must also have had both Zhu Yun and Qian Daxin in mind when he wrote the preface.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Second, the manner in which he revised and expanded his early draft of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> further shows that the rewriting was prompted by Zhu Yun’s and Qian Daxin’s criticizing it as “empty talk on philosophy” (<i class="calibre9">kongshuo yili</i> <span>空</span><span>說</span><span>義</span><span>理</span>), for the rewriting, as Dai himself pointed out, consisted mainly of quoting extensively from the classics to support his original argument. Liang Qichao, who carefully compared the two versions, fully confirmed this point.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1489" id="calibre_link-1582" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup> Thus, we see that Dai’s revision of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> was not necessitated by philosophical reasons. He did it with the express purpose of establishing his philosophical argument on a firm textual basis. In a quiet but persistent manner, he refuted the philologists’ charge that his philosophical treatise was merely “empty talk.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Third, in the latter part of the preface, Dai turned from the defensive to the offensive by pointing out the philologists’ inability to maintain a systematic view of the teachings of the sages. This is a typical hedgehog’s denunciation of the fox’s habit of mind. The term “students of the classics” in the preface leaves little doubt that, here, Dai was speaking of the philologists. Later, in 1769, he made the same point in a positive way by exhorting the philologists to rise above philology in their classical studies to learn the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1490" id="calibre_link-1583" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If Dai’s rewriting of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> was done under the pressures of philologism, the same pressures can also be shown to have been at work in his writing <i class="calibre9">of Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>. It is all the more revealing that once again Zhu Yun was directly involved. The following story was told by the intellectual historian Jiang Fan <span>江</span><span>藩</span> (1761&ndash;1831), one of Zhu Yun’s disciples:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1377" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Hong Bang <span>洪</span><span>榜</span> (1745&ndash;1779)…throughout his life admired Dai’s scholarship. At the time when Dai’s <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> was produced, readers could not comprehend its meaning, and only Bang considered its contribution as great as Yu’s (founder of the Xia dynasty) achievement [in regulating the waterways]. He wrote a <i class="calibre9">xingzhuang</i> <span>行</span><span>狀</span> (career biography) of Dai that included [Dai’s] letter to Peng Chimu <span>彭</span><span>尺</span><span>木</span>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1491" id="calibre_link-1584" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup> When my teacher Sihe <span>笥</span><span>河</span> (Zhu Yun) saw this, he said, “This [item] need not be included. This is not the kind of work by Dai that is worthy to be handed down.” Bang then wrote [Chu] a letter of protest. The fact that now this letter is not found in the <i class="calibre9">xingzhuang</i> is because Dai’s son, Zhongli, finally excluded it. It was not [Bang’s] decision.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1492" id="calibre_link-1585" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>To get to the heart of the matter, it is necessary to take a close look at Hong’s letter to Zhu, which reads, in part:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In our last conversation, you instructed me, “[Dai’s] reply to Peng Chimu in the <i class="calibre9">xingzhuang</i> need not be included. [Philosophical topics such as] Human Nature and the Way of Heaven cannot be heard [from Confucius].<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1493" id="calibre_link-1586" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup> Why should there be further discussions in addition to those of the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi? This is not the kind of work by Dai that is worthy to be handed down.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>During the conversation, I only listened to your instruction. Out of respect, I didn’t dare to say a word. Now as I look back, since you are a well-respected leader of the scholarly world, you wouldn’t possibly say anything without good reasons. I can think of three possible reasons for your objection [to the inclusion of Dai’s letter]. First, the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi are all eminent worthies with moral perfection. It is therefore undesirable to contradict their established doctrines…. Second, it is important for a student of the classics to follow the methodology of his own field. Han Learning has its own methodology, and so does Song Learning. Now since Dai specialized in textual technicalities and excelled in etymology, it would be better for him to stay away from [philosophical discussions of] the meanings of [Human] Nature, and the [Heavenly] Decree (<i class="calibre9">ming</i> <span>命</span>) so that his weakness may not be exposed and his strength obscured. Third, it may be argued that one can only exert oneself to become a Confucian scholar, but one cannot attain sagehood through learning. One can hardly avoid exaggeration when one tries to characterize an antiquarian scholar in terms of the moral qualities of a sage. As far as I can see, your objection probably arises from these three contradictions. <sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1494" id="calibre_link-1587" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>It must be pointed out that when Zhu Yun raised his objection to Hong Bang, he did not give any specific reasons. The above three reasons, therefore, were all conjectures on the part of Hong. In my judgment, the most likely explanation is that Zhu’s objection was based on something very close to the second reason listed in Hong’s letter, namely, a Han Learning philologist should never meddle with philosophical speculation typical of Song Learning.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1221" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Dai’s letter to Peng Shaosheng, written in 1777, is actually a summary of his major philosophical arguments in both <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> and <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>. Thanks to Zhang Xuecheng, we already know that from the very beginning, Zhu had disapproved of Dai’s adventures in philosophy and had contemptuously called Dai’s <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> and his other philosophical pieces “empty talk.” Obviously, Zhu didn’t change his view after Dai’s death and he honestly believed that by asking Hong Bang to exclude the letter from the <i class="calibre9">xingzhuang</i> he was rendering his beloved friend a last important service. From his strictly philological point of view, he just couldn’t bear to see the image of Dai as a great classical scholar marred by a proclivity for philosophical nonsense. To allow Dai’s “empty talks on philosophy” to be handed down to posterity was only to subject him to ridicule in history, for his admiration for Dai’s classical scholarship had reached such an emotional height that he seized every opportunity to quarrel heatedly with Qian Zai <span>錢</span><span>載</span> (1708&ndash;1793) when the latter denounced Dai’s philology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1495" id="calibre_link-1588" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>There can be no doubt that Hong Bang was fully aware of Zhu’s radical philologism. Hence, toward the end of his letter, he defended Dai’s <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> in the following way: “Among Dai’s writings on Human Nature and the Heavenly Decree, none is more comprehensive than his study of the <i class="calibre9">Book of Mencius</i>. Nevertheless, he titled this study <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> [Mengzi ziyi shuzheng]. Hence, it is not a work talking about Human Nature and the Heavenly Decree. It is rather a work dealing exclusively with etymology and textual technicalities.” <sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1496" id="calibre_link-1589" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">43</a></small></sup> By arguing that the title of the <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> suggests philology rather than philosophy, Hong unwittingly revealed, at the same time, an important psychological secret of Dai’s&mdash;an inner tension created by psychological pressures of philologism. Actually, Dai’s final adoption of a philological title as well as philological form of presentation for his major philosophical work makes sense only when it is understood as an indirect reply to the philologists’ charge that in doing philosophy he was engaged in “empty talk.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1497" id="calibre_link-1590" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">44</a></small></sup> He was merely trying to say that his philosophy was an inevitable outgrowth of his philology. This is typical of Dai’s response to the challenge of the philologists, which we have already observed in his revisions of <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Unfortunately, however, Hong’s letter has given rise to a serious modern misunderstanding of the destiny of Dai’s philosophy vis-à-vis the intellectual climate of mid-Qing China. Commenting on Dai’s adoption of a philological title, Hu Shi indicated that Dai did this because he had to yield to the authority of the Cheng-Zhu school. “It turned out, however,” Hu deplored, “that in the end, the opposition of the followers of the Cheng-Zhu school just proved to be unavoidable.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1498" id="calibre_link-1591" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">45</a></small></sup> Here, Hu misread the situation completely. As has been shown above, if Dai ever yielded to an authority, it could only have been the authority of Han Learning. Furthermore, speaking of the opposition of the Cheng-Zhu school in this context, Hu has practically identified Zhu Yun as a Cheng-Zhu follower, which is an impossible thing to do.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1102" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Zhu Yun, a leader of the philological movement, contributed greatly to the rise of the so-called Han Learning in eighteenth-century China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1499" id="calibre_link-1592" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">46</a></small></sup> According to Sun Xingyan <span>孫</span><span>星</span><span>衍</span> (1753&ndash;1818), he was extremely critical of classical studies since the Southern Song, when, in his opinion, they were marked by emptiness and Buddhist influence. To him, true classical scholarship could only be founded on sound philology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1500" id="calibre_link-1593" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">47</a></small></sup> Zhang Xuecheng, a disciple of Zhu, characterized his mentor as a scholar who followed strictly the interpretations of Han exegetes in everything from etymology, mathematics, and textual technicalities to the meanings of the classics.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1501" id="calibre_link-1594" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">48</a></small></sup> The imperial <i class="calibre9">Siku quanshu</i> compilation project was initiated in 1773 largely on his suggestion.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1502" id="calibre_link-1595" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">49</a></small></sup> It is true that, unlike Ji Yun <span>紀</span><span>昀</span> (1724&ndash;1805), he did not attack the Cheng-Zhu school openly. Nevertheless, it seems too far-fetched to suggest that a scholar with his kind of philological orientation would have been opposed to Dai’s philosophy in defense of the Cheng-Zhu school. Hu Shi was apparently misled by Chu’s remark, “Why should there be further discussions in addition to those of the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi?” By this remark, as far as I can judge, Chu meant to say that even Cheng-Zhu philosophy was “empty talk.” Why should Dai want to add still more? As a radical philologist, Chu was equally contemptuous of Dai and the Cheng-Zhu school on this score. In a word, he was, like many other leading philologists of the day, an antiphilosopher.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In this connection, we must also say something about the Cheng-Zhu school as it was during the lifetime of Dai Zhen. The Cheng-Zhu teachings, of course, remained orthodox in the sense that they continued to be tested in examinations, but we obviously cannot identify everybody who studied the Cheng-Zhu texts for examination purposes as a follower of the Cheng-Zhu school. There must also have been many moralists who still lived, thought, and talked quite comfortably within the confines of the Cheng-Zhu weltanschauung, but these people were no more Cheng-Zhu Confucians than all churchgoers are Christians. What was conspicuously lacking in the Cheng-Zhu school during the reign of Qianlong (1736&ndash;1795) was, therefore, an intellectual spokesman who could defend the Cheng-Zhu philosophical position ably and intelligently.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1503" id="calibre_link-1596" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">50</a></small></sup> Both Zhu Zeyun <span>朱</span><span>澤</span><span>澐</span> (1666&ndash;1732) and Wang Maohong <span>王</span><span>懋</span><span>竑</span> (1668&ndash;1741), the two fine Zhu Xi scholars of the Qing Period, were long dead when Dai began to write philosophically in the early 1760s. Even if we take the Cheng-Zhu school as state ideology, the Qianlong Period did not produce a political spokesman comparable to Lu Longqi <span>陸</span><span>隴</span><span>其</span> (1630&ndash;1693), Xiong Cil<span>ü</span> <span>熊</span><span>賜</span><span>履</span> (1635&ndash;1709), Li Guangdi <span>李</span><span>光</span><span>地</span> (1642&ndash;1718), or Zhang Boxing <span>張</span><span>伯</span><span>行</span> (1652&ndash;1725). Hence, by Dai’s time, the Cheng-Zhu school had become philosophically impoverished.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1504" id="calibre_link-1597" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">51</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1096" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>On the other hand, the tide of Han Learning, in which Dai participated, was very much on the rise. According to the contemporary account of Yuan Mei <span>袁</span><span>枚</span> (1716&ndash;1797), scholars of the day all competed with each other in promoting Han Learning and attacking Song Learning. This intellectual fashion almost carried the whole empire, the south as well as the north.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1505" id="calibre_link-1598" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">52</a></small></sup> Hu Qian <span>胡</span><span>虔</span> (<i class="calibre9">juren</i> 1796), a friend of Zhang Xuecheng, also made a similar observation. In praising Xu Shen <span>許</span><span>慎</span>, the Han lexicographer, and denouncing Zhu Xi, Hu wrote that “ten thousand mouths almost speak with one voice.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1506" id="calibre_link-1599" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">53</a></small></sup> With the so-called Song Learning weakened beyond repair, it could not possibly have threatened Dai Zhen so much as to require him to present his philosophical ideas under the veil of philology. Moreover, as we have seen, Dai’s criticism of Song Learning, from <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> to <i class="calibre9">Preface</i>, and finally in <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>, clearly reveals a process of escalation that defies all disguises, no matter how clever and skillful. In fact, it is doubtful that he ever had any intention of concealing his philosophical differences with Song Confucianists. In his “Da Peng Shaosheng shu” (Reply to Peng Shaosheng), he said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The central ideas in my <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i>, together with the various arguments set forth in my <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i>, are all sharply dissimilar from the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> you espouse. It was in deference to your wishes that I showed them to you. Now in your letter, you say that we have differences as well as similarities. On my part, however, I think we are totally different and there is not even the slightest similarity between us.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1507" id="calibre_link-1600" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">54</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>This is a perfect example showing that Dai had no scruples about driving his philosophical differences with the so-called School of Song Learning beyond the breaking point.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Dai’s debate with Peng Shaosheng took place in 1777, only a month before his death. According to the evidence, Peng was the only scholar who had the privilege of reading the <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> while Dai was still alive. If it is at all justifiable to say that during Dai’s lifetime his philosophy had been seriously challenged by the Cheng-Zhu school, then this probably was it, although Peng’s credentials for membership in that school are not entirely unproblematic.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1508" id="calibre_link-1601" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">55</a></small></sup> Other contemporary scholars who had criticized Dai’s philosophical ideas from the Cheng-Zhu point of view included Yao Nai <span>姚</span><span>鼐</span> (1732&ndash;1815), Weng Fanggang <span>翁</span><span>方</span><span>綱</span> (1733&ndash;1818), and Cheng Jinfang <span>程</span><span>晉</span><span>芳</span> (1718&ndash;1784). But a close scrutiny reveals that all their serious critical pieces were written only after Dai’s death, largely because neither <i class="calibre9">Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in Mencius</i> nor <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> was published until 1777&ndash;1779.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1509" id="calibre_link-1602" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">56</a></small></sup> Of the three, probably only Yao had actually exchanged views with Dai on problems concerning Song philosophy when both were in Beijing.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1510" id="calibre_link-1603" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">57</a></small></sup> However, since Yao had been a great admirer of Dai and even asked to become his disciple in 1755, it is rather unlikely that their philosophical discussions could have been very heated.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1511" id="calibre_link-1604" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">58</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1205" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the above, I have briefly reviewed the general state of affairs in which the adherents of Song Learning found themselves in the second half of the eighteenth century. The aggregate evidence shows rather conclusively that this school, in sharp contrast to that of Han Learning, lacked not only leadership but also vitality. It was in no position to put up any effective or organized resistance to the dynamic intellectualism of Dai Zhen. The revitalization of Cheng-Zhu orthodoxy and its counterattack against Han Learning in general and Dai Zhen in particular did not take place until about half a century after Dai’s death. Under the influence of Yao Nai, Fang Dongshu <span>方</span><span>東</span><span>樹</span> (1772&ndash;1851) wrote a powerful systematic critique of Han Learning, the <i class="calibre9">Hanxue shangdui</i> <span>漢</span><span>學</span><span>商</span><span>兌</span> (Evaluation of Han Learning), in 1824&mdash;a year that may be taken as the beginning of the decline of Qing philologism. Writing on January 25, 1861, Li Ciming, with the exaggeration and sentimentality typical of a Chinese diarist, held Yao Nai responsible for having transformed China, within a short span of less than forty years, from a world of profound learning to one of complete illiteracy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1512" id="calibre_link-1605" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">59</a></small></sup> Hence, if the Cheng-Zhu school as a formidable philosophical enemy of Dai Zhen during the latter’s lifetime was imaginary, existing only in the mind of modern historians, it was, nevertheless, a real one in the middle of the nineteenth century.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>With the development of his philosophical ideas, Dai’s attitude toward Cheng-Zhu orthodoxy grew increasingly antagonistic and uncompromising. His relationship with philology was an entirely different story, however. Throughout his life, but especially in his later years, he displayed a deep-rooted ambivalence toward philology. On the one hand, his faith in the fruitfulness of various new methods and techniques as they were firmly developed in the broad realm of classical philology was almost unlimited. He believed, with other leading scholars of the day, that philology was the only key to open the arsenal of classical texts in which the sages’ <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> was hidden. Yet on the other hand, he refused to stress the importance of philology beyond its methodological significance. In his view, there was a natural connection leading classical philology to Confucian philosophy. To rest content with philological probing itself was to mistake the means as the end. Interestingly enough, we find him, at times when he was not fully on guard, even speaking in contempt of philology. To penetrate the depth of his ambivalence toward philology, it is necessary to examine some of his oral remarks, which, in my judgment, are psychologically much more revealing than his formal writings.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Dai once told Duan Yucai:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Matters pertaining to such fields as etymology and mathematics may be compared to sedan-chair bearers, whose function is to carry the sedan-chair rider. To identify me as a person good only at such matters as etymology and mathematics is to mistake a sedan-chair rider for a sedan-chair bearer.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1513" id="calibre_link-1606" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">60</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>A slightly different version of this remark is also given by Zhang Xuecheng as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1216" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>I take etymology, phonetics, astronomy, and geography to be my four sedan-chair bearers; the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> I am trying to make clear is the mandarin who rides in the sedan-chair. What a pity the so-called outstanding scholars of our time are qualified only to communicate with my sedan-chair bearers.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1514" id="calibre_link-1607" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">61</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>The analogy in both versions is the same, but the emphasis is somewhat different. In Duan’s version, Dai was mainly concerned with his own intellectual identity; he did not want to be taken as a philologist, even an archphilologist. In Zhang’s version, he used the same sedan-chair analogy to achieve a different purpose, namely, to express his disdain for those philologists who, because of inability or lack of interest, or both, refused “to rise from the grasp of the minute and disconnected to the grasp of the whole.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1515" id="calibre_link-1608" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">62</a></small></sup> The difference between these two versions is no cause for suspicion. The sedan-chair analogy was probably a favorite of Dai’s, which he must have used on many occasions. In both cases, however, it is unmistakable that the common theme was to disparage philology and promote philosophy. Psychologically, there is still something deeper than just that. I strongly suspect that by making remarks like these he was consciously responding to the challenge of both Zhu Yun and Qian Daxin. The reference to “the so-called outstanding scholars of our time” in Zhang’s version makes this identification almost inevitable. Conceivably, Dai may have been greatly annoyed by the repeated criticism of these two esteemed friends that he simply wasted time in “applying his good self to a field of futility,” that is, to “empty talk on philosophy.” The philologists of the day just could not bring themselves to recognize, as he did, the existence of a natural connection between classical philology and Confucian philosophy. In frustration and anger, he therefore issued his stinging retort that they were qualified only to make friends with his sedan-chair bearers.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1103" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>That Dai’s above remarks were aimed at philologists such as Zhu Yun and Qian Daxin can be confirmed by another oral remark of his preserved in Jiang Fan’s <i class="calibre9">Guochao Hanxue shicheng ji</i> (Record of the transmission of the masters of the school of Han learning). Chiang related, “Dai Zhen once told people, ‘Among contemporary scholars, I consider Qian Daxin to be number two.’ For Dai implied that he himself was by far the number-one scholar.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1516" id="calibre_link-1609" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">63</a></small></sup> Here, we must pause and ask, Precisely on what ground could Dai claim his superiority over Qian in learning? Needless to say, the claim could not possibly have been made on the ground of erudition, which was, by and large, a commonly accepted standard among Qing philologists. As Paul Demiéville has rightly pointed out, “As far as erudition goes, Qian Daxin seems to have been the greatest scholar of his time, greater than both Zhang Xuecheng and Dai Zhen.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1517" id="calibre_link-1610" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">64</a></small></sup> We must, therefore, look elsewhere for a sensible answer. Fortunately, a valuable clue to the problem is furnished by the following autobiographical statement Dai once made to Duan Yucai: “Learning consists primarily in mastery of essence (<i class="calibre9">jing</i> <span>精</span>), not pursuit of erudition. In my own case, I have never pursued erudition (<i class="calibre9">bo</i> <span>博</span>).”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1518" id="calibre_link-1611" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">65</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>What Dai called “mastery of essence” (<i class="calibre9">jing</i>) is very close in meaning to what Zhang Xuecheng called “essentialism” (<i class="calibre9">yue</i> <span>約</span>) or “specialization” (<i class="calibre9">zhuanjia</i> <span>專</span><span>家</span>), which, in the context of their discussions, must be understood as characteristic more of philosophy than of philology. I believe it was by resorting to a criterion more philosophical than philological that Dai, in this mid-Qing context of Confucian learning, pronounced Qian Daxin to be the first runner-up, and reserved the number-one place for himself. Revealingly enough, it was also on the very same ground that Zhang Xuecheng, quite independently of Dai, came to the conclusion that Dai “was actually the number-one scholar of the Qianlong Period.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1519" id="calibre_link-1612" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">66</a></small></sup> Even a late Qing critic of Han Learning such as Zhu Yixin <span>朱</span><span>一</span><span>新</span> (1846&ndash;1894) said, when making a comparison between Dai and Qian: “Among the scholars of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, [Dai] Dongyuan and [Qian] Zhuding <span>竹</span><span>汀</span> were two giants, one excelling in the classics (Dai) and the other in history (Qian). Zhuding surpassed Dongyuan in terms of erudition, but was inferior to the latter in profundity.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1520" id="calibre_link-1613" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">67</a></small></sup> It is interesting that in his first judgment, Zhu followed precisely Qian’s own criterion of erudition, which, as we have seen above, is also the one adopted by Demiéville.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1521" id="calibre_link-1614" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">68</a></small></sup> In the second judgment, however, Zhu apparently shifted to Dai’s emphasis on “mastery of essence,” which he characterized as “profundity.” Dai’s message contained in this remark, therefore, can be fully understood only in the light of his sedan-chair analogy. In Dai’s eyes, since Qian, with all his erudition, never rose “from the grasp of the minute and disconnected to the grasp of the whole,” he was a sedan-chair bearer. On the other hand, Dai did not hesitate to assign to himself the number-one place in the scholarly world of the day because, in his self-definition, he was always a Confucian philosopher, riding comfortably in the sedan-chair. In a still deeper sense, however, this remark of his may not have been intended simply as a personal criticism of Qian Daxin. What he really meant to say was that philology can never claim to be Confucian learning of the highest order. By virtue of its being immediate to <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, only philosophy can make such a claim in Dai’s scheme of things. Once again, Dai responded to the challenge of the philologists in his typically subtle and indirect way.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>There is another aspect of Dai’s oral remarks that illustrates his strained relationship with the philologists. By this I refer particularly to his open attacks on the Cheng-Zhu school. Let me first quote a systematic classification of Dai’s oral remarks by Zhang Xuecheng:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1283" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Generally speaking, Dai’s oral remarks may be classified into three types. Speaking to prominent court officials of high scholastic standing, he tended to be more or less agreeable. Only occasionally did he express his own ideas, but only to the extent to which he considered that such ideas were acceptable to them. He never wanted to elaborate on his ideas. In conversations with his disciples, however, he was truly helpful by always giving them enlightening instructions. Talking with his admirers who were not learned enough to follow his teachings, his style was extremely elusive. He was often enigmatically abstruse and therefore beyond grasp.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1522" id="calibre_link-1615" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">69</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>All three categories of people can be identified. The “prominent court officials of high scholastic standing” referred to, among others, Zhu Yun, Qian Daxin, Lu Wenchao <span>盧</span><span>文</span><span>弨</span> (1717&ndash;1796), Qin Huitian, and Wang Mingsheng <span>王</span><span>鳴</span><span>盛</span> (1722&ndash;1798). The “disciples” were Duan Yucai and Wang Niansun. Dai’s “admirers” were numerous, but here Zhang must have had Feng Tingcheng <span>馮</span><span>廷</span><span>丞</span> and Wu Yingfang <span>吳</span><span>穎</span><span>芳</span> specifically in mind.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1523" id="calibre_link-1616" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">70</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>People in the first category were all leading philologists of the day, whose support and sympathy could mean a great deal to the cause of the reconstruction of Confucian philosophy that Dai was championing. I strongly suspect that some of Dai’s anti&ndash;Cheng-Zhu remarks were intended to arouse feelings of comradeship among his fellow philologists. Take the following two remarks, recorded by Zhang Xuecheng, for example:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Now, with my appearance on the scene, the time probably has arrived for Zhu Xi to run out of luck. Anyway, he has been fortunate enough to dominate the intellectual world for over five hundred years.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1524" id="calibre_link-1617" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">71</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>and</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>I have written my <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> in the hope that I shall eventually find my niche in the Confucian temple.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1525" id="calibre_link-1618" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">72</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>It is quite understandable that Zhang found such remarks repugnant. But the question is, what sort of psychological force had driven him to say things like this?</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1083" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>To say that Dai had a “devious” or “impure” mind (<i class="calibre9">xinshu weichun</i> <span>心</span><span>術</span><span>未</span><span>醇</span> or <i class="calibre9">xinshu buzheng</i> <span>心</span><span>術</span><span>不</span><span>正</span>), as Zhang persistently did, is probably right, but does not explain much.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1526" id="calibre_link-1619" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">73</a></small></sup> It only gives us a different question: Why did Dai happen to have a “devious” or “impure” mind? I suggest that in making such remarks, Dai was also responding to the psychological pressures of philologists, but from a different direction. If, by way of his sedan-chair analogy, he was to show the nonfinality of philology in Confucian learning, his avowed candidacy for a place in the Confucian pantheon occupied by Zhu Xi was to tie his new philosophy to the philological movement. He was trying to make his fellow philologists see that his dedication to philosophical work, on the solid foundation of Qing philology, was by no means an expression of personal idiosyncrasy. On the contrary, he would like to think that in doing philosophy, he was serving the common cause of the Qing philological movement. After all, his philosophy was the synthesis of Qing philological findings, and, moreover, the school of Han Learning could not expect to prevail over that of Song Learning in its bid for Confucian orthodoxy without a final, decisive victory on the philosophical battleground. Dai’s remarks, as quoted above, seem to suggest that his aspiration to replace Zhu Xi in the Confucian temple, if it ever came true, would symbolize the establishment of a new Confucian orthodoxy rather than just a personal triumph for Dai. His special reference to his <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> is also significant. Isn’t it clear that he was taking this opportunity to answer the charge of Chu Yun and Qian Daxin that <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> “was empty talk on philosophy and should not have been written”?</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It is obvious that these oral remarks by Dai appealed to emotion rather than to reason. Yet this is probably precisely why Zhang Xuecheng had found Dai agreeable to leading scholars of the day. It may be noted that the mid-Qing philological movement was from the beginning a highly emotionally charged one, with several of its leaders harboring, to varying degrees, strong anti-Song (or, more precisely, anti-Cheng-Zhu) feelings.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Before Dai came into contact with this movement in 1754, he had no quarrel with Song Confucianism. On the contrary, under the influence of Jiang Yong, he sometimes even defended the Cheng-Zhu philosophical tradition.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1527" id="calibre_link-1620" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">74</a></small></sup> However, his attitude toward Song Confucianism took a drastic iconoclastic change after his meeting with Hui Dong in Yangzhou in 1757. More than anybody else, Hui was responsible for giving the Qing philological movement the name of Han Learning. From a strictly philological point of view, he accused Song Confucianists of philological illiteracy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1528" id="calibre_link-1621" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">75</a></small></sup> His iconoclasm reached its emotional peak when he said, “Song Confucianism was even more disastrous than the burning of books by the Qin.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1529" id="calibre_link-1622" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">76</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Ji Yun, a chief editor of the <i class="calibre9">Complete Library of the Four Branches</i>, was another scholar who apparently pushed Dai deeper into the anti-Song campaign. Ji’s tactics against the Cheng-Zhu school were unique in that he launched, simultaneously, a frontal attack and a flanking attack. As a chief editor of <i class="calibre9">Complete Library of the Four Branches</i>, he made biting criticisms of Song Confucianism in a systematic and organized way throughout the massive <i class="calibre9">Siku quanshu zongmu tiyao</i> <span>四</span><span>庫</span><span>全</span><span>書</span><span>總</span><span>目</span><span>提</span><span>要</span> (Catalogue of the Complete Library of the Four Branches)<i class="calibre9">.</i><sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1530" id="calibre_link-1623" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">77</a></small></sup> As a popular writer, he composed numerous fables and anecdotes to expose the hypocrisy of Cheng-Zhu moralists.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1531" id="calibre_link-1624" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">78</a></small></sup> He was indeed the only scholar in traditional China who ever attempted to undermine the influence of Song Confucianism not only in high culture but in popular culture as well. It is conceivable that some of Dai’s anti&ndash;Cheng-Zhu remarks may have been but echoes of Ji’s utterances.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1226" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>I must hasten to add, however, that I am not suggesting that Dai’s philosophical writings are all products of a deliberate need to satisfy the anti-Song feelings of his fellow philologists.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1532" id="calibre_link-1625" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">79</a></small></sup> His philosophical differences with Zhu Xi are genuine differences, which even the critical Zhang Xuecheng found little room to doubt. What disturbed Zhang was rather the inconsistency between the pen and the tongue. Chang was particularly worried about the disintegrating influence of Dai’s oral remarks, for not long after Dai’s death, he already heard many prominent scholars saying, “When the day comes that Dai’s learning reigns supreme, it will be as easy to demolish Zhu Xi as to break down a decayed stump.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1533" id="calibre_link-1626" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">80</a></small></sup> This last quote is extremely revealing. It tells us that Dai’s strategy of appealing to the philologists’ longing for Confucian orthodoxy was, after all, not without effect. Zhang Xuecheng was very observant in detecting the inconsistencies between Dai as a writer and Dai as a conversationalist. With all his profundity in psychological observation, however, he failed to fathom the depth of Dai’s inner tension arising from the latter’s self-identity as a Confucian philosopher vis-à-vis the antiphilosophical temper inherent in Qing philologism. It is in terms of this inner tension that Dai’s inconsistencies must be understood.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Finally, I conclude this study with a brief review of Dai’s intellectual development, focusing on his changing views of Confucian learning. Heretofore, historians have generally discerned in Dai’s life two stages of development, with his visit to Yangzhou in 1757 as the dividing line.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1534" id="calibre_link-1627" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">81</a></small></sup> In what follows, however, I try to establish that Dai’s thought underwent altogether three stages of development, reaching full maturity only in the last decade of his life. This development is nowhere more clearly shown than in his discussions of the structure of Confucian learning, to which I now turn.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In a letter to Fang Ju <span>方</span><span>矩</span> dated 1755, Dai wrote: “From antiquity to the present, there have been altogether three different approaches to learning: some take the philosophical approach, others take the philological approach, and still others take the literary approach. Of the three, however, the literary approach must be regarded as the last in importance.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1535" id="calibre_link-1628" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">82</a></small></sup> As far as I know, this is the earliest clear formulation of the well-known triptych of Confucian learning&mdash;philosophy, philology, and literary art&mdash;although scholars had long pursued the three types of intellectual activity before Dai Zhen. What is particularly noteworthy in this statement is the fact that Dai did not treat the three branches of Confucian learning as of equal value. This point becomes more readily recognizable when we turn to his letter to Zheng Yongmu <span>鄭</span><span>用</span><span>牧</span>, probably written in 1750, in which he further stated, “Today there are many learned men who excel in literary art and philology, but none of them seems interested in seeking to know the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1536" id="calibre_link-1629" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">83</a></small></sup> Here his partiality for philosophy is too obvious to be ignored. Taking these two letters together, it is clear that during this early stage, philosophy was placed far above philology and literary art in his intellectual system. Philology fared better than literary art, but paled noticeably beside philosophy. This explains why, in the same letter to Fang Chu, he did not hesitate to praise Song Confucianists as philosophically sound in spite of all their philological imperfections.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1101" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>His second stage, in which philology figured centrally in his conceptions of learning, lasted roughly from 1757 to 1766. It was during this period that he told Duan Yucai: “Philosophy, philology, and literary art each has its own fountainhead. I should like to think that I have found all three fountainheads.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1537" id="calibre_link-1630" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">84</a></small></sup> Two points may be observed in this connection. First, to say that philosophy, philology, and literary art come from separate “fountainheads” implies, logically, that they are not interrelated. This is decidedly different from his earlier view, as his letter to Fang Ju makes clear: literary art was first linked to what he called “root,” which is largely identifiable with philosophy, and then eventually to the “ultimate root,” which was none other than <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> itself. Second, his whole conception of Confucian learning took on a fundamental structural change. The earlier hierarchical structure was replaced by a more or less egalitarian one, in which philosophy could no longer claim its priority over either philology or literary art. But Dai’s egalitarianism is much more apparent than real. In fact, through this structured readjustment, he elevated philology to a place that was almost immediate to the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. Thus, we find him saying, in 1765, that “only if philology is clear, can the ancient classics be understood; and only if the classics are understood, can the sages’ philosophical ideas then be grasped.” Between philology and “the sages’ philosophical ideas” (<i class="calibre9">Dao</i>), there is little room left for philosophy as a legitimate branch of inquiry in Confucian learning.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Dai’s radical philological point of view in the second stage should probably occasion little surprise, since it was during this period that the impact of the philological movement on him was the strongest. In fact, the view to which he subscribed was widely shared by many other philologists of the time. Zhang Xuecheng has told us:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The so-called learning as conceived by scholars of our time consists only of [studies of] terminology in the classical dictionary <i class="calibre9">Erya</i> and etymology [based on] the <i class="calibre9">liushu</i>, or Six Graphic Principles, which are, in their opinion, all that matters to our world. As for the philosophical works of Zhou [Dunyi] and the Chengs (Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi), or the literary writings of Han [Yu] and Ouyang [Xiu], they simply cast them aside with a sniff. Even the open-minded ones among them do no more than divide learning into three branches of philosophy, philology, and literary art, and take each on its own merit.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1538" id="calibre_link-1631" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">85</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1050" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In this passage, it may be noted, Zhang presented two current views of Confucian learning. The first view was apparently too narrow to be embraced by Dai, but the second one was almost surely Dai’s. It not only fit well with Dai’s “fountainhead” theory just quoted, but also echoes Zhang’s formulation as given in his letter to Zhang Runan <span>章</span><span>汝</span><span>楠</span> right after his first encounter with Dai in 1766.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1539" id="calibre_link-1632" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">86</a></small></sup> It may be recalled that although Dai’s philosophical career was well under way toward the end of this stage, his declaration of philosophical independence from the Cheng-Zhu school was not officially proclaimed until he “smashed the Supreme Ultimate Chart of the Song Confucianists” in his traumatic experience of 1769. Hence, throughout this stage, his criticism of Song Confucianism was mainly confined to the realm of classical philology. In this stage&mdash;unlike the first one&mdash;he could no longer accept Cheng-Zhu philosophy as basically sound, but&mdash;unlike the final stage&mdash;his own systematic philosophy was not yet fully established. It was probably because of this interregnum that philosophy became temporarily out of focus in his view of Confucian learning.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the last decade of his life, Dai concluded his long intellectual development with a final, definitive view of Confucian learning. According to Duan Yucai, Dai had retracted the “fountainhead” theory and had told Duan, “Philosophy is the fountainhead of philology and literary art. How could there be a fountainhead of philosophy? What I said before is an overstatement.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1540" id="calibre_link-1633" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">87</a></small></sup> In another context, Duan further quoted his master’s words as follows: “Only after one becomes thoroughly familiar with philosophy can he then engage in philology and literary art.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1541" id="calibre_link-1634" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">88</a></small></sup> This last statement explains what Dai meant by “philosophy is the fountainhead of philology and literary art.” Clearly, he now returned to his early position by stressing the immediacy of philosophy to the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. He seems to say that to engage in philology and literary art without the “central vision” provided by philosophy can lead only to blindness. At any rate, he appears to have fully regained his confidence in philosophy.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>But why should he now deny philosophy its “fountainhead”? Duan Yucai explained that this is because the first “philosophy” as preserved in the Six Classics is the creation of the sages, and is itself the “fountainhead” of our political, social, and moral order.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1542" id="calibre_link-1635" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">89</a></small></sup> This explanation is in basic agreement with Dai’s own theory of <i class="calibre9">ziran</i> <span>自</span><span>然</span> (natural) and <i class="calibre9">biran</i> <span>必</span><span>然</span> (necessary), according to which sagehood consists primarily in creatively transforming the natural to the necessary, which is synonymous with <i class="calibre9">li</i>, or “principle.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1543" id="calibre_link-1636" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">90</a></small></sup> It was, in the final analysis, Dai’s emphasis on the creativity of the human mind that eventually led to his realization of the absurdity of speaking of “fountainhead” in the case of philosophy.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Dai’s final view of Confucian learning is further expressed in his “Yu mou shu” (Letter to Someone) written in 1777, which reads, in part:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1178" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the study of the classics, elucidation of the meaning of words comes first. The next step is to understand the grammar of the text. However, if one’s final goal is to search for the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, then he must purge himself completely of all his dependence. Although the etymology of the Han scholars was based on an orthodox line of transmission, at times it suffered from forced interpretations. The Jin exegetes had even more far-fetched interpretations and groundless speculations. Those of the Song judged by introspection; thus, they often accepted many errors, renouncing precisely what was not wrong…. Scholars since the Song have wrenched their own ideas into identity with what the ancient sages and wise men intended to say, without really understanding their spoken and written language.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1544" id="calibre_link-1637" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">91</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Basically, the structure of Dai’s final view bears a remarkable resemblance to that of his early one. Nevertheless, it also shows marks of his struggles with both Song philosophy and Qing philology during the middle stage. The structure is again hierarchical, with philosophy as the lord and philology and literary art, in that order, as maids. But no longer would he be so compromising as to maintain that Han Confucianists were philologically correct but philosophically unsound, while Song Confucianists were just the opposite. On the contrary, he was now as much critical of the Han philologically as he was of the Song philosophically. Freedom from all dependence in the search for truth was thus both the starting point and the terminal point of Dai’s intellectual life. Quite symbolically, his was a life that began with a minor philological question at the age of ten,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1545" id="calibre_link-1638" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">92</a></small></sup> but that ended with a major philosophical answer five years past the age at which Confucius knew the Decree of Heaven.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1546" id="calibre_link-1639" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">93</a></small></sup></span></div>

Starting in 1943, Hu Shi spent almost two decades in a special investigation of this cause célèbre.

Moreover, contrary to the charge that Dai made false references to the <i class="calibre9">Yongluo dadian</i> <span>永</span><span>樂</span><span>大</span><span>典</span> text to cover up his plagiarism, Hu Shi was able to show that on a number of occasions, Dai followed the <i class="calibre9">Yongluo</i> text even to a fault. Although the whole matter is too complicated to be dealt with adequately here, it is nevertheless clear that the case usually lined up against Dai is based only on some misinterpreted circumstantial evidence. It is also interesting to note that modern scholars such as Meng Sen <span>孟</span><span>森</span> and Wang Guowei <span>王</span><span>國</span><span>維</span>, who charged Dai with plagiarism, were invariably unsympathetic toward Dai’s anti&ndash;Neo-Confucian philosophical point of view. It is only fair that any responsible scholar who still wishes to press the same charge against Dai must of necessity take full account of Hu Shih’s findings.

In this short piece of 1765, Dai said: “It has often been said that there is Han Confucian classical learning and there is Song Confucian classical learning; the former is philological in approach, the latter philosophical. I am greatly puzzled by this statement. Alas, if the so-called philosophical ideas [of the sages] can be obtained by sheer speculation apart from the classics, then anyone would be able to grasp them out of emptiness. If that is the case, what do we need classical learning for?” Clearly, this is a subtle way of saying that Song Confucianism is sheer speculation without textual basis in the classics. This passage contrasts sharply with the text of his 1755 letter to Fang Ju <span>方</span><span>矩</span>, in which he wrote: “The <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> of the sages is contained in the Six Classics. [In understanding the classics,] the Han Confucianists are philologically correct but philosophically unsound, whereas the Song Confucianists are philosophically sound but philologically incorrect” (<i class="calibre9">DWJ</i>, 144).</span></div>

During the last decade of his life, however, Dai respected Jiang only as an ordinary senior scholar. This psychological change on the part of Dai may be explained by the fact that he no longer shared Jiang’s faith in Cheng-Zhu Confucianism.

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1213" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the learned judgment of modern intellectual historians, Dai Zhen <span>戴</span><span>震</span> (1724&ndash;1777) and Zhang Xuecheng <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span> (1738&ndash;1801) are the two towering scholars in eighteenth-century China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-5" id="calibre_link-81" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> Perhaps nothing would strike the contemporaries of Dai and Zhang, including their common friends, such as Zhu Yun <span>朱</span><span>筠</span> (1729&ndash;1781) and Shao Jinhan <span>邵</span><span>晉</span><span>涵</span> (1743&ndash;1796), as more absurd than this modern judgment. In their own times, Dai was widely acknowledged as the foremost leader of the new philological movement in Confucian classical studies, whereas Zhang, though well respected as a serious theorist of history and literature in a small coterie of learned friends, was practically unknown to the general intellectual world. With <i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i> <span>考</span><span>證</span> (“philology,” or evidential research) firmly established as the sole criterion of Confucian scholarship in the eighteenth century, the academic standing of Zhang was nowhere near that of Dai. Even as late as the last decade of the nineteenth century when Zhang’s work was gradually gaining recognition, he was still rated far below Dai as a scholar. For example, the young Zhejiang scholar Sun Baoxuan <span>孫</span><span>寶</span><span>瑄</span> (1874&ndash;1924), in his diary of 1894, expressed only a limited appreciation of Zhang’s original ideas and criticized his magnum opus <i class="calibre9">Wenshi tongyi</i> <span>文</span><span>史</span><span>通</span><span>義</span> (General principles of literature and history) as a whole as narrow in conception and interpretation. By contrast, he showed unbounded admiration for Dai when he devoted a whole week in 1898 to a close reading of Dai’s collected essays.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-6" id="calibre_link-82" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1222" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>With the turn of the century, however, a new criterion of scholarly excellence gradually emerged. It was the scholar’s ability to rise above philology to search for the hidden meanings in a classical text that was prized above all other qualities. Here we detect a subtle shift in emphasis in late Qing intellectual history from <i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i> to <i class="calibre9">yili</i> <span>義</span><span>理</span> or, in David S. Nivison’s neat translation, from “philology” to “philosophy.” As a result, since the beginning of the twentieth century, Dai’s philosophy has become the focus of intellectual attention while his philology has been praised rather than studied.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-7" id="calibre_link-83" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> It is also the rise of this modern criterion that has elevated Zhang to the niche in the mid-Qing world of Confucian learning that he truly deserves.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In this study, I propose to examine the intellectual relationship between Dai and Zhang that, hopefully, may also throw some light on the inner complexities as well as tensions in the academic community of eighteenth-century China. It has been well established since Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962) that Dai exerted a considerable influence on Zhang’s early view of Confucian scholarship. It is also common knowledge now, as Nivison has rightly pointed out, that “Zhang both admired and denounced Dai.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-8" id="calibre_link-84" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup> As a matter of fact, Zhang referred to Dai explicitly as well as implicitly in many dozens of his essays and letters, the last one being the essay “Zhedong xueshu” <span>浙</span><span>東</span><span>學</span><span>術</span> (Intellectual tradition of Eastern Zhejiang) written in 1800. Moreover, he not only denounced Dai vehemently but also defended him with equal intensity and vigor. Such strong feelings on Zhang’s part suggest that Dai’s influence on him must have been much more profound and enduring than has been heretofore recognized by scholars. This underrecognition has arisen, however, not so much from misreading and misunderstanding on the part of his modern interpreters as from the fact that some of Zhang’s writings, discovered relatively late in the 1940s and 1950s, have not been sufficiently studied. It is these new materials, now conveniently collected together in the 1985 Beijing, Wenwu edition of the <i class="calibre9">Zhang Xuecheng yishu</i> <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span><span>遺</span><span>書</span> (Remaining writings of Zhang Xuecheng) that compel us to reexamine Zhang’s intellectual development in the light of his lifetime struggles with Dai’s philology as well as philosophy.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">THE FIRST ENCOUNTER</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2474" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>To begin with, we must first clarify the obscurities around Zhang’s first meeting with Dai. Nivison tells the story as follows: “One older scholar to whom Zhu [Yun] may have introduced his pupil (i.e., Zhang) was Dai Zhen, a leading philologist and a man who, unlike most advocates of ‘solid learning,’ was seriously interested in philosophy. It is likely that Zhang first met Dai Zhen in 1766 when Dai was in the capital to lecture and to attempt the <i class="calibre9">jinshi</i> <span>進</span><span>士</span> examination.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-9" id="calibre_link-85" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup> This is a close and learned guess summing up all the modern findings on the event of singular importance in Zhang’s intellectual life. Fortunately, among the above-mentioned new materials, we find a letter in which Zhang gives his own account of his first meeting with Dai. In “A Letter in Reply to Shao Jinhan” (Da Shao Eryun shu), he recalled:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Sometime between spring and summer of 1766, at the suggestion of Zheng Chengzhai <span>鄭</span><span>誠</span><span>齋</span> (i.e., Zheng Huwen <span>虎</span><span>文</span>, 1714&ndash;1784), the Hanlin Compiler, I went to see Mr. Dai at the hostelry of Xiuning <span>休</span><span>寧</span>. I asked him about his learning and Dai outlined it for me in a general way. A suspicion was immediately aroused in my mind that what Compiler Zheng had told me about Dai might be an understatement. I was then staying with our teacher Zhu [Yun] and had the good fortune of making acquaintances with all the accomplished scholars of the time, which, needless to say, had greatly widened my intellectual horizon. However, it was only in Mr. Dai that I found someone who could almost be said to have grasped the essentials of ancient sages and penetrated far into the realm of universal truth.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>At that time, it may be remembered, both Mr. Zhu [Yun] of Daxing and Mr. Qian [Daxin] <span>錢</span><span>大</span><span>昕</span> of Jiading were the two towering figures of highest academic reputation among scholar-officials in the capital. They both admired Dai but only to the extent of Dai’s penetrating and refined studies in textual criticism, philology, etymology, and mathematics. When it came to Dai’s [philosophical] treatises, such as <i class="calibre9">Yuanshan</i> <span>原</span><span>善</span> [Inquiry Into Goodness], they regretted to see [Dai] applying his good self to a field of futility. At that time, I argued forcefully in front of Master Zhu, contending that [Dai’s philosophical] theories were indeed the most rewarding part of his textual investigations. Unfortunately, my position was humble and my words carried little weight. None of the esteemed scholars was listening to me. During that period, you yourself were also in the company of Jiading <span>嘉</span><span>定</span> (Qian) and Daxing <span>大</span><span>興</span> (Zhu). But I didn’t hear you take my side by saying a word to convince both [Qian and Zhu] that [Dai] was actually the number one scholar of the Qianlong Period.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-10" id="calibre_link-86" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1300" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This letter reveals a number of important facts about the first encounter. First, it confirms not only the modern conjecture about the year of the meeting as 1766 but also gives the more precise time as between spring and summer. Second, contrary to the earlier speculation, it was Zheng Huwen, not Zhu Yun, who introduced Zhang to Dai. Zheng had known Dai at a much earlier date when he was the director of Ziyang <span>紫</span><span>陽</span> Academy in Xin-an <span>新</span><span>安</span>, Dai’s native city.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-11" id="calibre_link-87" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> Third, modern scholars are in general agreement that in the first encounter, Zhang was utterly shattered by the powerful logic of Dai’s philological point of view. Now, in light of this letter, we know that Zhang was also deeply impressed by Dai’s philosophical project. This is a very important point to which I shall return later. Fourth, in his “Postscript to Zhu <span>朱</span> and Lu <span>陸</span>” (Shu Zhu Lu pian hou), Zhang deplored that while scholars of the day admired Dai’s philological accomplishments, they nevertheless failed to grasp the central significance of Dai’s contribution to Confucian philosophy. However, he stopped short of identifying these “scholars of the day.” From this letter it is clear that when he made this statement, he had specifically in mind his teacher Zhu Yun and the eminent scholar Qian Daxin, both of whom he highly respected. Thus, the letter provides us with a most important clue to Dai’s inner tension arising from his choice between philosophy and philology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-12" id="calibre_link-88" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Shortly after his first meeting with Dai in 1766, Zhang reported part of their conversation to Zhang Runan <span>章</span><span>汝</span><span>楠</span> as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Formerly in reading books I set out to get the general meaning, and being young and enthusiastic, I applied myself merely to wide reading in all branches of literature, without having any end in view. I was fond of advancing theories that were lofty rather than acute, and attacked textual scholarship, soaring about in emptiness. I was always pleasantly satisfied, supposing that I understood things. But I was astonished when I heard Dai Dongyuan <span>戴</span><span>東</span><span>原</span> of Xiuning shake his fist and shout, “Present-day scholars, no matter what they deal with, are primarily guilty of never having learned to read correctly!” Startled, I asked him what he meant; he said, “If I were unable to comprehend the ideas of ‘before heaven’ and ‘after heaven’ or the subtle wealth of meaning in the books from the He and the Luo, I would not pretend to have read the <i class="calibre9">Classic of Changes</i>; if I were unable to understand the courses of the stars, the variations in the heavens from year to year, the constellations, and the patterns of earth, I would not pretend to have read the astronomy sections of the <i class="calibre9">History</i>.”…We were indeed perfect examples of what he was saying, for we actually never opened a volume of a single Classic of the Four Books. How shameful! How shameful!<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-13" id="calibre_link-89" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1044" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Based on this letter alone, it is only natural to assume, as scholars actually did in the past, that the conversation between Zhang and Dai in their first meeting was confined to philology. However, the above-quoted letter to Shao Jinhan shows beyond doubt that their conversation must have also turned to Confucian philosophy. I can give two reasons to support this point: First, in preparing Zhang for the first meeting, Zheng Huwen must have, like everybody else, praised Dai’s philology in the highest possible terms. Then why did Zhang find Zheng’s description an “understatement”? This can only mean that during the conversation Zhang discovered, much to his surprise and delight, that Dai was not only a classical philologist but also a Confucian philosopher. Second, after the meeting, Zhang began to defend Dai’s philosophical work, especially <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i>, against the attacks of Zhu Yun and Qian Daxin. This strongly suggests that <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i> must have been mentioned and perhaps even discussed in their conversation. It happened that in early 1766, Dai had just completed the revised and expanded version of his <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i>. He was so excited about this new accomplishment in Confucian philosophy that it was the first thing he told his disciple Duan Yucai <span>段</span><span>玉</span><span>裁</span> (1735&ndash;1815) when the latter arrived in Beijing.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-14" id="calibre_link-90" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> It seems almost certain that when Dai outlined his own scholarly work to Zhang, he would have mentioned <i class="calibre9">Inquiry Into Goodness</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>At this juncture, a further question must be asked, namely, why did Zhang go to the trouble of honoring Dai with a formal visit. Given our knowledge of Zhang’s introverted personality, sometimes even bordering on eccentricity, it was indeed a matter of unusual seriousness for him to initiate such a well-prepared visit to a perfect stranger. It is unlikely that he was primarily motivated by simple curiosity, let alone vanity, to meet and interview a famous scholar. I am inclined to think that at this point, Zhang was experiencing some kind of self-doubt with regard to his pursuit of learning. Nivison has neatly summarized a general distinction Zhang made between two types of scholars as follows: “Intellectual tempers differ. There are, in the broadest terms, those who tend to grasp intuitively the significance of things, to see things in large wholes, and there are others who are naturally interested in detailed matters of fact.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-15" id="calibre_link-91" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> This is almost exactly a Chinese version of Isaiah Berlin’s distinction between the hedgehog and the fox.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-16" id="calibre_link-92" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> According to his self-analysis, Zhang was a person of the first type or, in Berlin’s term, a hedgehog. From childhood, he had developed a keen interest in grasping the general significance of things, as well as a distaste for textual details. Reminiscing with his sons in 1791, he stated:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>When I studied the writers of old, I had more insight than patience. Therefore, I often neglected minute philological and textual matters. However, my intuitive understanding guided me at times to see things often overlooked by previous scholars.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-17" id="calibre_link-93" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>But this hedgehog’s point of view was seriously challenged when he came to seek instruction from Zhu Yun in Beijing in 1765. As he reported in his 1766 letter to Zhang Runan:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Recently, I have come to study under Mr. Zhu. He also says that he disapproves very much of those shallow but bright young scholars who, lacking sufficient knowledge, like to indulge in empty talk of philosophy. Therefore, when he gives instruction to his students, he wants them to begin with investigating hard facts, only after which are they allowed to develop general views of their own.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-18" id="calibre_link-94" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1243" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Beijing in the mid-eighteenth century was the center of what may be called the movement of philologism, and philologists were, by definition, foxes due to either intellectual temper or pressures generated by the movement. By “philologism,” I refer to a widely held belief among radical advocates of philology in Zhang’s time that a philological approach alone can lead to the discovery of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> long buried in the pre-Confucian as well as Confucian texts. After Zhang joined the academic circle of Zhu Yun in 1765, he was directly exposed to the dominant influence of philologism. Surrounded by philological foxes, he was probably somewhat less sure than before about going his own way as a hedgehog. I would venture to suggest that it was most likely this self-doubt that prompted him to pay Dai a formal visit.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Having thus reconstructed the states of mind of both Dai and Zhang on the eve of their first meeting, it should occasion no surprise if the range of their conversation included both philology and philosophy. There remains, though, one more question about their first meeting: what did the meeting mean to Zhang? I am inclined to believe that it had a double meaning for Zhang in a critical moment in his intellectual life. It gave him a challenge as well as a reassurance. The challenge, as has been well established, was a philological one, whereas the reassurance was philosophical in nature. The two are interconnected, however. It probably did not take long for Zhang to discover that Dai never meant to pursue philology for its own sake. On the contrary, Dai had been all along typical of a hedgehog, seeking to “know one big thing”&mdash;the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>&mdash;and placed philology squarely in the service of philosophy. To put it in a different way, Dai, like Zhang, was a person who also sought to grasp the significance of things and, above all, relate everything to a single central vision. To Zhang, who was now in his late twenties but still in quest of intellectual self-definition, this discovery must have been a great revelation. Dai alone was able to make him see the inner connectedness between philology and philosophy. In the age of Confucian intellectualism, a true philosophical vision worthy of pursuit could only be built on solid philological grounds. Perhaps this explains why Zhang was, at least for a while, thoroughly convinced of the importance of philology. But he was also reassured by the encouraging example of Dai that he had been steering his course of study in the right direction after all. His immediate task, however, was how to meet the philological challenge to which we now turn.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">THE SEARCH FOR AN INTELLECTUAL BASE</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>To understand the nature of the “philological challenge” Zhang Xuecheng faced, we need to know something about the general intellectual mode of the Qing Period as distinguished from the preceding age. As keenly observed by the Confucian thinker Gong Zizhen <span>龔</span><span>自</span><span>珍</span> (1792&ndash;1841):</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1169" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> <span>道</span> consists of two main strands, namely, “honoring the moral nature” (<i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> <span>尊</span><span>德</span><span>性</span>) and “following the path of inquiry and study” (<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> <span>道</span><span>問</span><span>學</span>). In the beginning, these two strands do not contradict but lend support to each other; they are expected to end in unity. In the past, however, only a few in a generation or even one in several generations may be regarded as having successfully combined the two strands in such a way. The majority merely followed whichever trend happened to dominate their own times. Since the beginning of our dynasty, the scope of Confucian studies has been greatly broadened. Nevertheless, ours is an age dominated by <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-19" id="calibre_link-95" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1217" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>For want of a better English term, I choose to call <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> “Confucian intellectualism.” I have interpreted Chinese intellectual history during the Ming-Qing transition in terms of the rise of Confucian intellectualism primarily because, as Gong Zizhen and other Qing scholars clearly recognized, the transition was from <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> to <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-20" id="calibre_link-96" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup> Under the dominant mode of “honoring the moral nature” (<i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i>), Confucians of both the Cheng-Zhu <span>程</span><span>朱</span> and the Lu-Wang <span>陸</span><span>王</span> schools tried to enunciate the moral principles of the ancient sages mainly through metaphysical speculation. Philological explication of classic texts was considered at best peripheral and at worst obstructive to the pursuit of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. However, metaphysical disputes between the Cheng-Zhu and Lu-Wang schools eventually led both sides to textual studies in the sixteenth century. Wang Yangming <span>王</span><span>陽</span><span>明</span> (1472&ndash;1529)’s effort to restore the so-called “old text of the <i class="calibre9">Daxue</i> [Great Learning]” initiated a series of philological exercises on this classical text in the seventeenth century. On the Cheng-Zhu side, Luo Qinshun <span>羅</span><span>欽</span><span>順</span> (1465&ndash;1547) also advocated a “return to the sources” as the way to settle philosophical disputes. Defending the Cheng-Zhu theory of “the nature is principle” against Lu Xiangshan’s <span>陸</span><span>象</span><span>山</span> “the mind is principle,” for example, Luo quoted several passages from the <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i> (Classic of Changes) and the <i class="calibre9">Mencius</i> to make his point. He concluded his argument by saying: “Thus if one carries on his studies <i class="calibre9">without seeking evidence in the classics</i> and is utterly arbitrary and opinionated, it is inevitable that he will be misled.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-21" id="calibre_link-97" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> It was this deeply felt need on the part of some late Ming Confucians to “seek evidence in the classics” in support of their philosophical views that step by step pushed Confucianism from within to a new direction. In the middle of the seventeenth century, it resulted in a fundamental shift in the frame of mind from “honoring the moral nature” (<i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i>) to “following the path of inquiry and study” (<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>). Gu Yanwu <span>顧</span><span>炎</span><span>武</span> (1613&ndash;1682), as has been generally held since the eighteenth century, was more responsible than anyone else for the establishment of this new paradigm in Confucian classical learning. His best-known statement, “the proper study of principles is the study of the classics” (<i class="calibre9">jingxue ji lixue</i> <span>經</span><span>學</span><span>即</span><span>理</span><span>學</span>), was one of the fundamental assumptions of Confucianism throughout the entire Qing Period. Once the focus shifted to classical texts, philology, including especially etymology, phonology, paleography, and textual criticism, began to assume a role of central importance in Confucian learning. Almost without exception, Qing classicists believed that philology alone could provide us with the key to the world of ideas and institutions supposedly created by the ancient sages. As Dai Zhen forcefully argued:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>It is precisely because free speculation cannot lead one to the philosophical ideas of the sages of antiquity that one has to seek them from the ancient classics. Since messages contained in the surviving records have gradually fallen into oblivion due to the expanse of time between the past and the present, one therefore has to seek them through philological studies [of the classics]. Thus, only if philology is clear can the ancient classics be understood, and only if the classics are understood, can the philosophical ideas of the sages then be grasped.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-22" id="calibre_link-98" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Since Zhang Xuecheng also shared the intellectualistic assumptions of Qing Confucianism, his initial response to Dai’s philological challenge was not rejection but shock and shame, as clearly shown in his 1766 letter to Zhang Runan quoted above. However, seven years later, in 1773, when Zhang met Dai again, he not only appeared to be completely recovered from his initial shock but also, as Nivison rightly observes, began to “crystallize his own distinctive point of view toward history and letters.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-23" id="calibre_link-99" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> In that year, the two scholars ran into each other twice, first in Ningbo and then in Hangzhou. A brief review of the two encounters will throw considerable light on the extent to which Zhang had reached his self-definition in Confucian learning with regained confidence since he first met Dai in 1766.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>According to Zhang, he had a heated debate with Dai in Ningbo <span>寧</span><span>波</span> on the subject of local historiography. As Dai saw it, the main concern of local history was to give a detailed, accurate account of the geographical, especially territorial, changes of the locality as an administrative unit (i.e., county, prefecture, or province). His emphasis on historical geography led him to such an extreme view that in two of his recently completed local histories, he denied biographical status to Buddhist monks and instead treated them as mere appendages to monasteries or temples. On his own part, however, Zhang took it to be the true function of local history to preserve what he called “the unpublished documents and the memories of the living elders” (<i class="calibre9">wenxian</i> <span>文</span><span>獻</span>) of a locality that are of contemporary relevance and practical usefulness. Citing Sima Qian’s <i class="calibre9">Shiji</i> <span>史</span><span>記</span> (Records of the Grand Historian) as authority, he argued that it is in the nature of history to give greater attention to the recent than to the remote past. Historical geography, in Zhang’s view, is important only for the study of the antiquity of a locality. It was on these grounds that Zhang came to the conclusion that Dai, with all his erudition and profundity in classical learning, did not understand history at all.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-24" id="calibre_link-100" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1179" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Thus, the dispute on local history reveals unmistakably the differences between Dai as a philologically oriented classicist and Zhang as a present-minded historian. In the case of Dai, it can be readily seen that he was applying the same kind of philological techniques in his study of the classic of historical geography&mdash;the <i class="calibre9">Shuijing zhu</i> <span>水</span><span>經</span><span>注</span> (Commentary on the Classic of Waterways)&mdash;to the compilations of local histories.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-25" id="calibre_link-101" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> It is also important to note that by saying that Dai, a great classicist, did not understand history, Zhang was not only advocating the autonomy of history but also elevating history to a status comparable to that of classical scholarship. I shall return to this point later.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In Hangzhou, Zhang overheard Dai’s severe criticism of Zheng Qiao <span>鄭</span><span>樵</span> (1104&ndash;1160)’s <i class="calibre9">Tongzhi</i> <span>通</span><span>志</span> (General History). From a strictly philological point of view, Dai found <i class="calibre9">General History</i> full of errors, especially in the section on astronomy. Zhang disagreed profoundly, but he kept silent at the time. Later he wrote a series of essays in defense of Zheng Qiao. In his view, <i class="calibre9">General History</i> as a historical synthesis is a truly outstanding work in terms of its “broad conception” (<i class="calibre9">honggang</i> <span>弘</span><span>綱</span>) as well as its grasp of the “meanings” (<i class="calibre9">yi</i> <span>義</span>) of the history of Chinese learning. To denounce this monumental work philologically was wholly to miss its main purpose.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-26" id="calibre_link-102" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> Here we encounter the problem of what is known in the West as the hermeneutic circle. As methodological individualists, Dai and other Qing philologists seem to have held that, in the process of understanding and interpretation, one must understand the parts before one can begin to grasp the whole. On the other hand, as a methodological holist, Zhang tended to place his emphasis on comprehension of the whole as a precondition for understanding the parts. This turned out to be one of Zhang’s fundamental disagreements with Dai, which he developed further in later writings.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-27" id="calibre_link-103" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Thus, the two meetings in 1773 show unmistakably that Zhang’s intellectual struggle with Dai’s radical philology finally came to fruition. Unlike during the first conversation, Zhang was no longer a passive listener. On the contrary, he was able to refute Dai’s views point by point from his own intellectual base&mdash;history. Let us turn to see how he established and developed this intellectual base of his own.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1028" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Zhang was a holistically oriented theorist in the age of Confucian intellectualism. Like classicists of the day, he was equally committed to the intellectualist ideal of scholarship as a Confucian calling. However, he was, by intellectual temper, disposed to history rather than classics. By his own admission, he showed a natural aptitude for history since childhood, but had little talent for classical philology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-28" id="calibre_link-104" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> His first long discussion with Dai in 1766 helped shape his academic career in two important ways. First, he became keenly aware that one could not possibly make one’s mark in whatever specialization in Confucian learning without first meeting the basic intellectualist requirement of grounding it in empirical, especially textual, scholarship. In Zhang’s case, needless to say, it was historical scholarship. Second, greatly encouraged by Dai’s example of making philology subservient to philosophy, he began to develop his theories of history and literature by working extensively in a great variety of texts. The results were the two projected books, <i class="calibre9">Wenshi tongyi</i> (General principles of literature and history) and <i class="calibre9">Jiaochou tongyi</i> <span>校</span><span>讎</span><span>通</span><span>義</span> (General meaning of bibliography), whose origins can both be traced to 1772.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-29" id="calibre_link-105" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup> Here a word about the relationship between these two works is in order.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As Nivison rightly points out, the term <i class="calibre9">wenshi</i> has both a literal meaning (literary art and historical writing) as well as a specific meaning (literary and historical criticism) as traditionally used by bibliographers. On the other hand, for Zhang, <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i> “was a free-ranging historical study of books and traditions of writing and learning to which they belong, a study that was to be somehow at the same time both explanatory and critical.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-30" id="calibre_link-106" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> Moreover, Nivison also describes the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i> as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>It is a theoretical work, ostensibly on the uncompromising subject of bibliography; in other words, it is a book about books&mdash;how to analyze and catalog them, after comparing texts to determine questions of authenticity, authorship, and completeness. Certainly it is this, but it is also in tight and systematic form a presentation of Zhang’s most fundamental theses on the philosophy of history and the criticism of literature and scholarship. It is a basic statement of his philosophical position as far as it had developed at this time.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-31" id="calibre_link-107" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>This is certainly an accurate description of the book. Here, however, an interesting puzzle emerges: thus described, where are we to draw the line between Zhang’s <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i> and <i class="calibre9">wenshi</i>? In the process of considering this puzzle, I have stumbled on a startling discovery. Since the whole matter is too complicated to be adequately treated here, I can only give a brief report of my findings.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It has been a generally accepted view that Zhang began writing his <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> in 1772. As this view is firmly established from Zhang’s letters to friends written in 1772 and 1773, there seems no reason to question it. Let me begin by citing some of these letters. He first mentioned <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> in his 1772 letter to Zhu Fenyuan <span>朱</span><span>棻</span><span>元</span> (1727&ndash;1782) in which he reported:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Since leaving the capital (i.e., in 1771), I have busied myself much with writing: I have worked over the entire field of letters and have written a <i class="calibre9">Wenshi tongyi</i>; and although the work is not complete, I have shown the general drift in three essays from the first part (i.e., <i class="calibre9">neipian</i> <span>內</span><span>篇</span>) of it, which I copied into a letter to Qian Daxin.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-32" id="calibre_link-108" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Then in his 1773 letter to Yan Dongyou <span>嚴</span><span>冬</span><span>友</span>, he said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1327" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>I thought I would cull out the essence of my reflections and make up a study of bibliography (<i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i>); so I studied the writings of Ban Gu <span>班</span><span>固</span>, Liu Xiang <span>劉</span><span>向</span>, and Liu Xin <span>劉</span><span>歆</span> reasoning back from them to Zhou <span>周</span> institutions, and I examined the <i class="calibre9">Wenxin diaolong</i> <span>文</span><span>心</span><span>雕</span><span>龍</span> and the <i class="calibre9">Shi tong</i> <span>史</span><span>通</span>; I have analyzed and distinguished between assertions and facts, and have classified and evaluated divergent traditions, and have written a <i class="calibre9">Wenshi tongyi</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-33" id="calibre_link-109" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Obviously, these two letters talk about the same thing, only with more details in the second one. If we trust his own words, then what he referred to as the <i class="calibre9">Wenshi tongyi</i> at this early date bears little resemblance to what we now have under the same title. Rather, it fits perfectly the description of the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i>, or, as Nivison says, “it is a book about books.” Hence, a reasonable explanation would be that what Zhang had written up to this time under the title of <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> was later to become part of his <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i>, a title that he did not actually have until, perhaps, 1779. This observation is further confirmed in his preface to <i class="calibre9">Hezhou zhi yu</i> <span>和</span><span>州</span><span>志</span><span>隅</span> (A synopsis of the history of Hezhou), written in 1774, in which he said: “I have shown my [<i class="calibre9">Wenshi</i>] <i class="calibre9">Tongyi</i> to others, and they still have hesitated to read it with confidence, presumably thinking it is mere theory (<i class="calibre9">kongyan</i> <span>空</span><span>言</span>, “empty words”) without any demonstration in reality. My <i class="calibre9">Synopsis</i> in twenty sections will have a hint as to how it may be applied, and by inference, one may see that the <i class="calibre9">Wenshi tongyi</i> is not vague and impractical theory.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-34" id="calibre_link-110" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> In this particular case, it is quite obvious that his reference to <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> would not make sense at all if it were to be identified with the work of the same title as it exists today. What theories or principles can we possibly find in the present <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> that may be “applied” to the bibliographical section in the <i class="calibre9">History of Hezhou</i>? Clearly, Zhang’s statement makes sense only if we substitute the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i> for the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History.</i> As a matter of fact, the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i>, in structure as well as in substance, resembles the bibliographical treatise (“Yiwen zhi” <span>藝</span><span>文</span><span>志</span>) of the <i class="calibre9">Hezhou zhi</i> so much that Nivison even suggests that it was a development of the latter.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-35" id="calibre_link-111" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1391" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As far as I can judge, what really happened may be surmised to have been as follows. In 1772, he had already developed some central ideas about what he called <i class="calibre9">wenshi jiaochou</i> in a number of essays. These essays, as the above-quoted letter of 1773 to Yan Dongyu clearly indicates, turned out to be about the theory of bibliography (<i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i>) rather than that of literary and historical writing (<i class="calibre9">wenshi</i>). In other words, they were the first drafts of essays that later went to form the first part (<i class="calibre9">neipian</i>) of the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i>. However, since at this time the title of the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i> was nonexistent, he therefore referred to “the three essays” he had shown friends (including Qian Daxin) as “from the first part of the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History.</i>” This confusion has been further aggravated by the fact that both the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> and the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i> are divided into “first part” (<i class="calibre9">neipian</i>, “Inner Chapters”) and “second part” (<i class="calibre9">waipian</i> <span>外</span><span>篇</span>, “Outer Chapters”), which makes the detection doubly difficult. For decades, scholars have tried to identify the “three essays” in the present <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> without getting anywhere. Now at least we are more or less sure that they must be among the eighteen essays in the first part of the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i>, especially those in chapter 1 dealing with general principles.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Nivison makes a sensitive comment on this problem. He says:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In these letters Zhang mentions for the first time the name of the volume of essays which is now his best-known piece of writing. But we can only guess what this early <i class="calibre9">Wenshi tongyi</i> must have been. Most of the work now in existence was written later. Moreover, there is an indication that Zhang at one time intended to use this title as a collective title for all his writings, or at least for all that he proposed to save.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-36" id="calibre_link-112" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Two points in this comment particularly deserve attention. First, it has been well established that practically all the important theoretical essays in the present <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> were written much later, between 1783 and 1792.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-37" id="calibre_link-113" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup> So the early <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> is more likely to have been the predecessor of the present <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i>. Second, it is also well grounded to say that Zhang had originally intended to use <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> “as a collective title for all his writings.” As Nivison further explains, “Zhang may, however, have modified this intention after changing the title of his <i class="calibre9">Jiaochou l</i><span>ü</span><i class="calibre9">e</i> <span>校</span><span>讎</span><span>略</span> to <i class="calibre9">Jiaochou tongyi</i> (which could not very logically be included in another <i class="calibre9">tongyi</i>).”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-38" id="calibre_link-114" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup> This certainly makes sense, but there is also another possibility. By the time he wrote the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i> in 1779, new ideas may well have grown in his mind to the extent that he decided to reserve the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> as the title for a more ambitious project. Moreover, we can easily see the vast differences between the early <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> and the later one from his entirely different attitudes toward them. From 1772 to 1774, he was very anxious to show his essays of the early <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> to his friends in hopes of being appreciated. However, in the case of the later one, he made a special point to keep his most original ideas concealed from the reading public during his lifetime. As his letter to Wang Huizu <span>汪</span><span>輝</span><span>祖</span> of 1796 makes abundantly clear, he was afraid that these ideas “might startle the world, horrify common folks, and be severely criticized by people.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-39" id="calibre_link-115" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup> It seems safe to conclude that the essays for the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> he referred to between 1772 and 1774 were the first drafts of what became the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1414" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The discovery of the simple fact that the early <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> was in reality the first version of the <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i> throws a good deal of new light on the development of Zhang’s thought in response to Dai’s philological challenge. In the first place, contrary to the previous speculation, in the early 1770s, Zhang did not write on topics of a highly philosophical nature like those in the present <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>. His essays during this period were largely distillations of bibliographical studies (<i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i>), close to the textual base he had specifically chosen to develop. This shows that he had indeed taken Dai’s words of 1766 to heart&mdash;one must not theorize without the support of some work of substance.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the second place, in his letter to Qian Daxin, originally written in 1772 but probably revised in 1798,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-40" id="calibre_link-116" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup> Zhang described what he was doing as <i class="calibre9">wenshi jiaochou</i> <span>文</span><span>史</span><span>校</span><span>讎</span>. What did he refer to by this term? Now we know that in 1772 he could not have possibly referred to the two famous books later published under the names of <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i> and <i class="calibre9">wenshi</i>, respectively. At this juncture, we must return to the question raised earlier: Where to draw the line between the <i class="calibre9">wenshi</i> and the <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i>? His grouping of the two parts together indicates that he had conceived of the two parts as inseparable from each other. As his work progressed, however, he gradually came to the realization that there were problems unique to the methodology of <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i> that needed to be treated separately&mdash;hence, the <i class="calibre9">Jiaochou tongyi</i> of 1779. From beginning to end, Zhang promoted <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i> as a legitimate field of study in Confucian learning, the function of which was not indiscriminate collection and cataloging of texts but clarification of the different traditions of thought and scholarship through systematic classification of texts.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-41" id="calibre_link-117" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup> Important as it was, Zhang nevertheless did not regard <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i> as an end in itself. Rather, it was to serve the higher purpose of his literary and historical studies (<i class="calibre9">wenshi</i>) that reveal the truth about <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. Thus, it may not be too far-fetched to suggest that his deliberate choice of the expression <i class="calibre9">wenshi jiaochou</i> was intended to challenge the hegemony of Dai’s classical scholarship built on philology (<i class="calibre9">jingxue xungu</i> <span>經</span><span>學</span><span>訓</span><span>詁</span>). However, from 1772 to 1783, he devoted himself wholly to building his own intellectual base through studies in historical bibliography (<i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i>). A newly discovered manuscript confirms my observation here. In a letter to Qian Dian <span>錢</span><span>坫</span> (courtesy name Xianzhi <span>獻</span><span>之</span>, 1744&ndash;1806), a relative of Qian Daxin, dated 1778, Zhang began by praising Qian’s profound knowledge of classical philology (<i class="calibre9">xungu wenzi</i> <span>訓</span><span>詁</span><span>文</span><span>字</span>). Then he went on to reflect on his own work as a contrast:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>As for myself, I can only understand the general meanings [of the classics] but I am unable to engage in philological studies. Following my own inclination, I would much prefer to discuss the historical work of Ban [Gu], Liu [Xiang] and Liu [Xin]. I set for myself the central task of delineating the origins as well as the traditions of all the writings. However, I am not sure if I have really grasped the ideas of the ancients.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-42" id="calibre_link-118" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2475" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This new evidence helps establish two important facts about his early thinking. First, as late as 1778 he still characterized himself primarily as a historical bibliographer. There is no hint whatsoever of his discovery of the philosophical ideas concerning history and literary writing that are found in the present <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>. Second, the contrast between Qian’s “philology” and his own “bibliography” reveals that he was consciously developing his intellectual base in <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i> as a counterchallenge to <i class="calibre9">xungu</i> of the classicists of his day, including, especially, Dai Zhen. As a matter of fact, later in this letter, he specifically mentioned Dai’s excellence in “philology” (<i class="calibre9">xungu</i>) while at the same time criticizing his excessive competitiveness to the extent of “pretending to know what he did not really understand.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-43" id="calibre_link-119" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup> In making this criticism, he must have had in mind his remark of 1773 that “Dai the classicist did not understand history.” There can be little doubt that the methodological tool of Zhang’s bibliographic studies was as central to his critical understanding of literature and history as Dai’s tool of philological researches was to his interpretations of the Confucian classics.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the third place, we can now distinguish two stages in Zhang’s intellectual development since his first meeting with Dai in 1766. The first stage stretched approximately from 1771, when he began writing a projected book, to 1783, when he produced his first essays of what became the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>. During this period, he was more emphatically concerned with establishing and solidifying his intellectual base by way of <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i> than developing his philosophical views on history and writing. His <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i> of 1779 may be taken as the representative product of this stage. The second stage covered the period from 1783 to his death in 1801. During these two decades, his main effort was to work out in a systematic fashion the central ideas of his <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>, which, unfortunately, remained more or less incomplete. The most productive years in this stage turned out to be 1788 to 1790, when a breakthrough took place in his theoretical thinking. Previously, due to the confusion arising out of the title of <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>, we generally assumed that he had been working on <i class="calibre9">wenshi</i> and <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i> simultaneously since 1771. Now, with this confusion removed, we can discern more clearly than ever before a sensible pattern in his intellectual growth from the textual base to the theoretical superstructure. Here Dai’s influence is unmistakable. As Zhang emphatically pointed out, Dai’s lifetime work in philology (<i class="calibre9">xungu</i>) was but a preparation for the reconstruction of Confucian philosophy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-44" id="calibre_link-120" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1051" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Needless to say, the two stages of Zhang’s intellectual development must be understood in relative terms. His emphasis in the first stage was placed on <i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i> and in the second stage on <i class="calibre9">wenshi</i>, but in neither case was it a matter of total exclusion of the other. However, true to the intellectualist spirit of his age, in both stages he demonstrated a remarkable consistency in testing the validity of his ideas by applying them to empirical research projects. It often resulted in a symbiotic growth of theory and practice in Zhang’s work. We have already seen how closely his <i class="calibre9">General Meaning of Bibliography</i> and <i class="calibre9">Hezhou zhi</i> were related to each other. Now let us briefly examine how his other major project, the <i class="calibre9">Shiji kao</i> <span>史</span><span>籍</span><span>考</span> (Critique of historical writings), helped the writing of his <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>. He first proposed this ambitious project to Bi Yuan <span>畢</span><span>沅</span> (1730&ndash;1793), governor of Henan, in 1787, and then from 1788 on, he worked on it, with interruptions, until the end of his life.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-45" id="calibre_link-121" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup> As Nivison rightly observes, “The enormous labor required by such a work was not expended for nothing, for it must have been a major stimulus to Zhang’s thinking during the years when he was writing the most interesting of those essays expressing his historiographical theories.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-46" id="calibre_link-122" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup> I wish to cite Zhang himself to substantiate this observation. In 1788, he wrote two letters to Sun Xingyan <span>孫</span><span>星</span><span>衍</span> (1753&ndash;1818) that bear importantly on our discussion here. The first letter, written in mid-spring, says:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Recently, I have been working on the <i class="calibre9">Critique of Historical Writings</i> project together with Hong [Liangji <span>洪</span><span>亮</span><span>吉</span>, 1746&ndash;1809] and Ling [Tingkan <span>凌</span><span>廷</span><span>堪</span>, 1747&ndash;1809] on behalf of His Excellency [Bi Yuan]. Having read a great variety of books, I have made some progress [in my own learning]. Probably I would be able also to take this opportunity to complete the writing of my <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-47" id="calibre_link-123" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">43</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>The second letter, written a few months later, further states:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>After I complete this project for His Excellency [Bi Yuan], I would like to use all the findings made in the course of it to establish my own theories. However, I would do this only for my own enjoyment. I would not dare to publish them at the moment. But nor would I dare to conceal them from a few friends who really understand me.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-48" id="calibre_link-124" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">44</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>The letters speak for themselves. However, it must be noted that it was in the second letter that Zhang first articulated what proved to be the most celebrated of his theories, “the Six Classics are all history.” His attempt at a new classification of historiographical bibliography led to the discovery of this idea that, in turn, also served as a guiding principle in his compilation of the <i class="calibre9">Critique of Historical Writings</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-49" id="calibre_link-125" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">45</a></small></sup> Not coincidentally, early in 1789, after having worked on the project slightly over a year, he was able to produce no fewer than twenty-three core essays of the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> within a period of two months. Such a sudden enlightenment even surprised Zhang himself, who later said, “In my whole life, I have never produced things at a speed as fast as this.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-50" id="calibre_link-126" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">46</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">“THE SIX CLASSICS ARE ALL HISTORY”</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1125" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Zhang’s central thesis in the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>, “the Six Classics are all history,” is one of the most thoroughly discussed topics in modern historical scholarship of China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-51" id="calibre_link-127" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">47</a></small></sup> In this study, no attempt will be made at a comprehensive review of this thesis and its full implications in Qing intellectual history. Rather, it will be examined strictly from the point of view of intellectual challenge and response between Zhang and Dai.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The late Professor Qian Mu <span>錢</span><span>穆</span> (1895&ndash;1990) was the first among modern scholars to suggest that Zhang’s thesis was intended to challenge the dominant paradigm of classical philologism of his day by questioning its fundamental assumptions.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-52" id="calibre_link-128" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">48</a></small></sup> Let us take this paradigm as our point of departure. By the second half of the eighteenth century, Gu Yanwu’s apt catchphrase, <i class="calibre9">jingxue ji lixue</i> (“the proper study of principles is the study of the classics”), quoted earlier, had become something of a self-evident truth. It was such a widespread notion that Zhang also copied the phrase into one of his notebooks.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-53" id="calibre_link-129" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">49</a></small></sup> As the leading philosophical spokesman of Qing classical philologism, Dai Zhen elaborated on the implications of that notion in many of his letters and occasional writings. The following succinct statement in Dai’s letter to his leading disciple, Duan Yucai, written a few months before his death, may be taken as an example:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Since I was seventeen years old, I have set the quest for <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> as my life goal. I was convinced that <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> can be found only in the Six Classics and the works of Confucius and Mencius. But unless we study the meanings of the words, institutions, and terminologies [in the classical texts] we will not be able to understand the language of the texts. Song Confucians ridiculed philology and ignored language. Thus, they may well be compared to people who wish to cross rivers without boats or climb high without ladders.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-54" id="calibre_link-130" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">50</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>This statement may very well be understood as a commentarial unpacking of Gu Yanwu’s original idea. It makes clear not only Gu’s deep distrust of metaphysical speculation but also his advocacy of the philological approach to the classics as the only way to repossess the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. Implicit in this statement are three important assumptions: first, the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> had already been discovered by the sages in classical antiquity, especially Confucius and Mencius; second, this <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is recorded in the texts of the Six Classics; third, only philology can explicate the original meanings of these ancient texts. It was specifically against similar arguments by Dai Zhen, as we shall see, that Zhang developed his thesis “the Six Classics are all history.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As noted earlier, 1789 was the most fruitful year of Zhang’s intellectual life as far as the writing of his <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> was concerned. In that year, he wrote a preface to a group of theoretical essays that reveals unmistakably that the crystallization of his central vision of Confucian learning resulted as much from a genuine lifetime quest of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> as from a decade-long inner struggle with Dai’s challenge. As late as 1789, twelve years after Dai’s death, the specter of his greatest intellectual rival continued to haunt him. Thus, he wrote:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1029" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>I am only qualified to discuss literature and history (<i class="calibre9">wenshi</i>), and cannot claim that I know the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. However, if I exclude literature and history from the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in my discussion, then literature and history would not be worthy of their names. I therefore examined the origin of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> and wrote these thirteen essays. I wish to show how literature and history actually began, as well as how Confucian learning eventually evolved into literature and history. Those Confucian scholars are mistaken when they say that the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> resides in a realm outside literature and history.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-55" id="calibre_link-131" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">51</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>In writing the last sentence of the above quote, Zhang particularly had Dai in mind. This point is fully borne out by his “Discussing Writing Again with Zhang Zhengfu <span>章</span><span>正</span><span>甫</span> ” (You yu Zhengfu lun wen) written in 1789 or 1790, where he said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The historical writings of Sima [Qian <span>司</span><span>馬</span><span>遷</span>, c. 145&ndash;85 <small class="calibre7">B.C.</small>] and Ban [Gu, c. 32&ndash;92] and the literary works of Han [Yu <span>韓</span><span>愈</span>, 768&ndash;824] and Liu [Zongyuan <span>柳</span><span>宗</span><span>元</span>, 773&ndash;819] are related to <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> much in the same way as are the philological studies of Ma [Rong <span>馬</span><span>融</span>, 76&ndash;166] and Zheng [Xuan <span>鄭</span><span>玄</span>, 127&ndash;200] and the classical commentaries of Jia [Kui <span>賈</span><span>逵</span>, 30&ndash;101] and Kong [Yingda <span>孔</span><span>穎</span><span>達</span>, 574&ndash;648]. But Dai [Zhen] says that these [historical and literary writings] are only “art” (<i class="calibre9">yi</i> <span>藝</span>), not <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. This is quite comparable to a person who happens to come to the capital by boat denying that there is also a land route to Beijing.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-56" id="calibre_link-132" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">52</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>In light of this letter, it is clear that Zhang’s preface of 1789 was but a subtle criticism of Dai without mentioning his name. He meant that his <i class="calibre9">wenshi</i> (literature and history) was no less immediate to <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> than Dai’s <i class="calibre9">jingxue</i> (classical scholarship). Here we must also point out that Zhang’s criticism was directed specifically against Dai’s “Letter to Fang Xiyuan <span>方</span><span>希</span><span>原</span> [Ju <span>矩</span>]” (Yu Fang Xiyuan shu), dated 1755. It was in this letter that Dai explicitly stated, on the one hand, that the writings of Sima Qian, Ban Gu, Han Yu, and Liu Zongyuan could only be regarded as “art” (<i class="calibre9">yi</i>) rather than <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> and, on the other hand, that “the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> of the Sages is all contained in the Six Classics.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-57" id="calibre_link-133" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">53</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Zhang rejected all three assumptions of Qing philologism as repeatedly elaborated by Dai. To begin with, he did not share Dai’s unlimited faith in philology. He showed considerable respect for the technically sophisticated philology of Dai and other contemporary classicists. However, technical competence in philology was far from being decisive in the interpretation of the meanings of a classical text. “In the past several thousand years,” he said, “Confucian scholars have failed to reach agreements” on such technical matters as the Six Graphic Principles (<i class="calibre9">liu shu</i> <span>六</span><span>書</span>) or the ancient system of phonetics. As a methodological holist, he believed that it was possible to grasp the general meanings of classical texts without the technical assistance of philology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-58" id="calibre_link-134" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">54</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1235" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Zhang also seriously questioned the validity of the other two assumptions of Qing philologism, namely, all important truths about <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> had already been discovered by ancient sages and they are all preserved in the Six Classics (an assumption that, it may be noted, had been generally accepted in the Confucian tradition since the Han dynasty). He was able to challenge such a long-established tradition because he had developed a wholly new conception of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. As modern students of Zhang generally agree, Zhang’s <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is thoroughly historicized.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-59" id="calibre_link-135" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">55</a></small></sup> As lucidly summarized by Nivison: “Indeed, the Classics by themselves, Zhang thinks, are not sufficient to reveal the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> fully. For what they do reveal, they reveal by showing what has been and what has happened in the past. Ultimately it is history itself, the course of events, that reveals the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, and obviously the Classics cover only a part of this.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-60" id="calibre_link-136" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">56</a></small></sup> What concerns us here, however, is not Zhang’s now well-publicized view of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> as such but how he used it to formulate his central thesis, “the Six Classics are all history,” as a response to Dai’s radical philology. We have seen that in his preface of 1789, he argued vigorously that his <i class="calibre9">wenshi</i> has as legitimate a claim to manifesting the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> as Dai’s <i class="calibre9">jingxue.</i> This is a view that he held to the end of his life. In 1796, he wrote to Zhu Gui <span>朱</span><span>珪</span> (1731&ndash;1807) and presented him a copy of the first printed edition of the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>. In this letter, he returned to his favorite theme, but this time speaking exclusively of classics and history:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In antiquity, people never drew a distinction between classics and history, or took either one as more important than the other. In my unconventional view, without a clear understanding of history, even great masters of the Confucian classics, like Fu Sheng <span>伏</span><span>勝</span> [third and second centuries <small class="calibre7">B.C.</small>] and Kong Anguo <span>孔</span><span>安</span><span>國</span> [c. 156&ndash;74 <small class="calibre7">B.C.</small>], Jia Kui and Zheng Xuan, could at most attain half of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. What I try to present in my [<i class="calibre9">Wenshi</i>] <i class="calibre9">Tongyi</i> is an attempt at a holistic grasp of the essentials of the ancients.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-61" id="calibre_link-137" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">57</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>What is particularly revealing about this statement is that it was again a criticism of Dai Zhen. A few lines back, he practically repeated his view about Dai in their 1773 debate on local history that with all his profundity in philology, Dai nevertheless did not know anything about history. Against this background, we are almost certain that the following passage from part 3 of his essay “On the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>” (Yuan Dao), is a contrast between Dai and himself:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>For that part of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> which is complete in the Six Classics and of which the meanings and implications are hidden in the past, it is sufficient for textual and philological studies to bring it to light. However, as to events and changes that occurred in later times, the Six Classics cannot possibly say anything about them. It is therefore important [for people in later times] to produce writings from time to time according to principles abstracted from the Six Classics in order to illustrate the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-62" id="calibre_link-138" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">58</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1236" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>According to this view, Dai, like the great Confucian masters of the Han dynasty, grasped no more than half of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>At this juncture, we must pause and ask a further question. Would Zhang admit that since he did not study the classics by way of philology, his understanding of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> was therefore also partial? The answer must be a resounding no. As the last sentence of his letter to Zhu Gui, quoted above, indicates, he was confident that he had arrived at a holistic understanding of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in its essentials, though not the details. As a holistically oriented historian, he discovered a truth of singular importance: “the Six Classics are all history.” But the reverse is not true; historical writings must not be taken as classics. As a matter of fact, he considered the term “classic” (<i class="calibre9">jing</i>) to be a misnomer or a historical error. In his essay (“Jingjie” <span>經</span><span>解</span> (An explanation of [the term] classic), he tried to show that etymologically, <i class="calibre9">jing</i> meant no more than outlines. It was commonly used in Mohist and Legalist rather than Confucian texts. Only long after Confucius’s death was the term <i class="calibre9">jing</i> sacralized and applied to texts of the Confucian school. “In the beginning,” he emphatically pointed out, “the Six Classics were not necessarily venerable titles.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-63" id="calibre_link-139" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">59</a></small></sup> The classics are sacred not because they are classics, but because they are originally historical in nature. As he expressed it unequivocally elsewhere, “Men of later ages venerated the classics because they are the history of the Three Dynasties (i.e., Xia <span>夏</span>, Shang <span>商</span>, and Zhou <span>周</span>).”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-64" id="calibre_link-140" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">60</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>With the thesis “the Six Classics are all history,” Zhang not only demolished Dai’s monopolistic claim to the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> but also sacralized history at the expense of classical scholarship of his day. Like all students of Zhang, I fully recognize the profundity and richness of this thesis in its philosophical as well as historical implications. It is far from my intention to simplify it by way of psychological reduction. Under no circumstances can intellectual history be reduced to personal psychology. All I am suggesting here is that had it not been for Dai’s challenge, it is almost certain that Zhang would not have formulated and argued his thesis in the way he actually does in the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">ZHU XI AND LU XIANGSHAN: TWO INTELLECTUAL GENEALOGIES</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1346" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Finally, Zhang’s lifelong intellectual tension with Dai Zhen culminated in his historical reconstruction of the two rival Neo-Confucian genealogies of Zhu Xi <span>朱</span><span>熹</span> (1130&ndash;1200) and Lu Xiangshan (1139&ndash;1192). Dai’s death in 1777 provided Zhang with an opportunity to reflect on the strengths as well the weaknesses of his rival’s scholarship. This he did in an essay entitled “Zhu and Lu.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-65" id="calibre_link-141" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">61</a></small></sup> Then, in 1800, a year before his own death, he wrote another essay under the title “Zhedong xueshu” (The intellectual tradition of Eastern Zhejiang), in which he traced his own intellectual ancestry all the way back to Lu Xiangshan. Though a quarter century apart, the two essays nevertheless complement each other in meaning and therefore constitute a single unit. What is left unsaid in the earlier essay (“Zhu and Lu”) is said in the later one (“The Intellectual Tradition of Eastern Zhejiang”), at least by implication if not by design.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-66" id="calibre_link-142" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">62</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In these two pieces of writing, he reconstructed two intellectual genealogies beginning with Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan, respectively. Before we comment on their substance, let us first look at the two genealogies. In “Zhu and Lu,” the Zhu genealogy runs as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>First generation: Huang Gan <span>黃</span><span>榦</span> (1152&ndash;1221) and Cai Chen <span>蔡</span><span>沈</span> (1167&ndash;1230); second generation: Zhen Dexiu <span>真</span><span>德</span><span>秀</span> (1178&ndash;1235), Wei Liaoweng <span>魏</span><span>了</span><span>翁</span> (1178&ndash;1237), Huang Zhen <span>黃</span><span>震</span> (1213&ndash;1280), and Wang Yinglin <span>王</span><span>應</span><span>麟</span> (1223&ndash;1296); third generation: Jin L<span>ü</span>xiang <span>金</span><span>履</span><span>祥</span> (1232&ndash;1303) and Xu Qian <span>許</span><span>謙</span> (1270&ndash;1337); fourth generation: Song Lian <span>宋</span><span>濂</span> (1310&ndash;1381) and Wang Wei <span>王</span><span>褘</span> (1323&ndash;1374); fifth generation: Gu Yanwu <span>顧</span><span>炎</span><span>武</span> and Yan Ruoju <span>閻</span><span>若</span><span>璩</span> (1636&ndash;1704).</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>It must be pointed out that the idea of “generation” in this essay is used very loosely, but it does not affect our discussion here. Then, in “The Intellectual Tradition of Eastern Zhejiang,” the following lineage from Lu Xiangshan is established:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Yuan Xie <span>袁</span><span>燮</span> (1144&ndash;1224), Yuan Su <span>袁</span><span>肅</span> (<i class="calibre9">jinshi</i>, 1199) and Yuan Fu <span>袁</span><span>甫</span> (<i class="calibre9">jinshi</i>, 1214); Wang Yangming (1472&ndash;1529), Liu Zongzhou <span>劉</span><span>宗</span><span>周</span> (1578&ndash;1645), Huang Zongxi <span>黃</span><span>宗</span><span>羲</span> (1610&ndash;1695), Mao Qiling <span>毛</span><span>奇</span><span>齡</span> (1623&ndash;1716), Wan Sida <span>萬</span><span>斯</span><span>大</span> (1633&ndash;1683) and Wan Sitong <span>萬</span><span>斯</span><span>同</span> (1638&ndash;1702); Quan Zuwang <span>全</span><span>祖</span><span>望</span> (1705&ndash;1755).</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1347" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>With regard to the two genealogies themselves, I wish to make the following observations: First, they are lists of “Confucian scholars” rather than “Neo-Confucian philosophers.” In both essays, Zhang explicitly stated that his criteria of selection were “mastery of the classics and respect for tradition” (<i class="calibre9">tongjing fugu</i> <span>通</span><span>經</span><span>服</span><span>古</span>) as well as avoidance of “empty talk on moral nature” (<i class="calibre9">kongyan dexing</i> <span>空</span><span>言</span><span>德</span><span>性</span>). Nowhere is his Confucian intellectualism more clearly revealed than in these two genealogies. Second, according to his “Postscript to Zhu and Lu,”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-67" id="calibre_link-143" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">63</a></small></sup> he wrote the earlier essay as a criticism of Dai Zhen. He traced Dai’s intellectual lineage from Gu Yanwu all the way back to Zhu Xi to show that Dai, in attacking Zhu Xi, “failed to understand his own historical position.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-68" id="calibre_link-144" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">64</a></small></sup> Third, in the essay “Zhu and Lu” of 1777, what is conspicuously missing is the genealogy of the Lu school. It is in the “The Intellectual Tradition of Eastern Zhejiang” (1800) that this missing genealogy is provided. However, a closer scrutiny reveals that this genealogy does not cover the Lu school as a whole but is restricted to Lu’s followers in Eastern Zhejiang. There can be no question that Zhang’s genealogical reconstruction in 1800 was intended primarily to place himself in the Lu tradition vis-<span>à</span>-vis Dai in the Zhu tradition. This point is fully borne out by the fact that Yang Jian <span>楊</span><span>簡</span> (1140&ndash;1226), the leading disciple of Lu Xiangshan, and Qian Dehong <span>錢</span><span>德</span><span>洪</span> (1497&ndash;1574) and Wang Ji <span>王</span><span>畿</span> (1498&ndash;1583), the two most outstanding philosophical heirs of Wang Yangming, are omitted from Zhang’s genealogy even though all were natives of Eastern Zhejiang. In other words, this genealogy was tailored to the precise specifications of his own intellectual identity.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Zhang’s reconstruction of the two Neo-Confucian genealogies throws a new light not only on his intellectual relationship with Dai but also his own stature as a philosophical spokesman of Qing Confucian intellectualism. Due to space limitations, however, only a brief account of these two related aspects can be given below.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-69" id="calibre_link-145" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">65</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>According to Nivison, Zhang discovered Huang Zongxi rather late, probably as late as 1795, after his own work had been basically accomplished. Only then did he begin to fully realize the importance of Eastern Zhejiang historical scholarship. On this basis, therefore, Nivison dismisses the notion that Zhang was a “member” of the “Eastern Zhejiang School”: “To talk of an ‘Eastern Zhejiang School’ as including Zhang Xuecheng is to fall into Zhang’s own historical-essentialist manner of speaking. Influence there may be, but Zhang’s self-identification with a special Zhejiang tradition was a lifetime’s afterthought.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-70" id="calibre_link-146" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">66</a></small></sup> To call Zhang’s self-identification with the “Eastern Zhejiang Intellectual Tradition” “a lifetime’s afterthought” is a true insight. But this insight needs to be developed so that the very nature of Zhang’s “afterthought” may be brought to light. To begin with, we must first ask the question why in his “Zhu and Lu” of 1777 is only the intellectual genealogy of Zhu Xi given, but not that of Lu Xiangshan? Was this due to the fact, as Nivison has shown, that Zhang was unfamiliar with Huang Zongxi’s work until as late as 1795? This is certainly an important part of the answer, but not the whole story. The other part, I would suggest, lies in the fact that Zhang was yet to reach the full maturity of his thought and scholarship. Now we know that in 1777 Zhang’s work was largely concentrated on his bibliographical and methodological (<i class="calibre9">jiaochou</i>) studies. His theoretical breakthroughs, such as “the Six Classics are all history,” were still a decade away, and the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> did not really exist except as a title. He could not justifiably conceive the intellectual rivalry between Dai and himself in terms of Zhu Xi versus Lu Xiangshan in the Southern Song or Gu Yanwu versus Huang Zongxi in the early Qing, as he actually did in “The Intellectual Tradition of Eastern Zhejiang.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1348" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Our next question, then, is when did he identify himself with the Qing tradition of historical scholarship in Eastern Zhejiang beginning with Huang Zongxi? It is true that the death of his friend Shao Jinhan in 1796 provided him with the occasion to review this tradition. He particularly praised Huang Zongxi, Shao Tingcai <span>邵</span><span>廷</span><span>采</span> (1648&ndash;1711), and Quan Zuwang for their contributions to the study of history,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-71" id="calibre_link-147" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">67</a></small></sup> but it is not clear whether he also considered himself a latter-day heir to this tradition. Moreover, there is evidence to the contrary. In 1797, he wrote a letter to Zhu Xigeng <span>朱</span><span>錫</span><span>庚</span> in which he summed up his characterization of Dai in “Zhu and Lu” with basically the same genealogy. However, the Qing part of the genealogy reads as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Down to the beginning of our dynasty, Gu Yanwu, Huang Zongxi, and Yan Ruoju all followed this [Zhu] tradition even more closely than in the genealogy of Confucian classicists of the Han dynasty. Dai’s classical scholarship actually took the works of these scholars as its point of departure. And yet he was harshly critical of the learning of Zhu Xi. This is indeed like a person who drinks the water but forgets its origins.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-72" id="calibre_link-148" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">68</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>It is most surprising that even as late as 1797, Zhang not only placed Huang Zongxi in the Zhu Xi tradition but also regarded him as one of Dai’s intellectual ancestors. Even if we consider this to have been a mere “slip” on Zhang’s part, the very “slip” itself is not without some deep psychological significance. At least it reveals that at this time, his self-identification with the East Zhejiang tradition of historical scholarship was not yet final. This simple fact also explains why he was unable to establish a genealogy for the Lu school in his 1777 essay on “Zhu and Lu.” In this sense, then, his “The Intellectual Tradition of Eastern Zhejiang” of 1800 was indeed “a lifetime’s afterthought.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1325" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In 1800, his eyes were failing and his health in general deteriorated rapidly. He was no longer able to write without assistance. Already he knew that his days were numbered. Nevertheless he found it necessary to give a finishing touch to his magnum opus. “The Intellectual Tradition of Eastern Zhejiang” was the last theoretical essay to go into the core chapters of the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>. There cannot be the slightest doubt that it must have meant a great deal to him. What, then, were some of the compelling reasons that prompted Zhang to write this last essay? We can only make a few guesses. First, as he was about to turn over the drafts of his <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> to a friend for final editing, he must have discovered that the 1777 essay on “Zhu and Lu” was grossly unbalanced in content. It traced Dai Zhen’s intellectual genealogy all the way back to Zhu Xi but said nothing about how his own work could be linked to the tradition of Lu Xiangshan. This is exactly the gap that the essay “The Intellectual Tradition of Eastern Zhejiang” was intended to close.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-73" id="calibre_link-149" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">69</a></small></sup> Second, with his own system of Confucian learning basically completed, he now probably felt justified to take Dai and himself as each representing a main line of approach to the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in the Confucian tradition, namely, Dai’s classical studies as opposed to his historical ones. To find a definite place for himself in the history of Confucian learning, he also needed an intellectual genealogy of his own, and nothing could serve this purpose better than the Eastern Zhejiang tradition of historical scholarship. It was obviously for this reason that he had to assign the pivotal role in this tradition to none other than Huang Zongxi, whom, it may be recalled, he had generously offered to Zhu Xi’s school three years earlier. As he said in “The Intellectual Tradition of Eastern Zhejiang”:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>It is generally acknowledged today that Gu Yanwu was the founder of Confucian learning of our dynasty. Gu, however, actually belonged to the intellectual tradition of Western Zhejiang. It is less well known that there was also a contemporary scholar, Huang Zongxi, from Eastern Zhejiang who stood shoulder to shoulder with Gu as the two towering figures. Intellectually, he not only followed in the wake of Wang Yangming and Liu Zongzhou but also broke new ground for Wan Sida and Wan Sitong. Thus, compared to Gu, we must say that his intellectual lineage was much longer. Gu was a follower of Zhu Xi and Huang of Lu Xiangshan…but they respected each other and never exchanged derogatory remarks…. Therefore, the Eastern Zhejiang and the Western Zhejiang have been two parallel rather than conflicting traditions. The emphasis of the Eastern Zhejiang tradition is placed on <i class="calibre9">zhuanjia</i> <span>專</span><span>家</span> (specialization), whereas that of the Western Zhejiang tradition is on <i class="calibre9">boya</i> <span>博</span><span>雅</span> (erudition), each following its own established practice.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-74" id="calibre_link-150" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">70</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Here, Zhang exaggerated the historical importance of Huang Zongxi to the point of contradicting his own account of Gu Yanwu as given in the long genealogy of the Zhu school in the essay “Zhu and Lu.” He presented Gu Yanwu as an isolated scholar by confining him geographically to the Western Zhejiang (Zhexi <span>浙</span><span>西</span>) region even though he knew very well that Gu’s influence had been nationwide all along.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-75" id="calibre_link-151" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">71</a></small></sup> This exaggeration is perfectly understandable, however, once we realize that he was in fact indirectly comparing himself to Dai Zhen.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Last but not least, Zhang’s last essay must be understood in light of his central idea in the <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i>, “The Six Classics are all history.” An important passage of “The Intellectual Tradition of Eastern Zhejiang” reads, in part, as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Learning in the period of the Three Dynasties (i.e., Xia, Shang, and Zhou) consisted only of history, not classics…. Men of later ages venerated the classics because they are the history of the Three Dynasties…. In the Eastern Zhejiang intellectual tradition, scholars interested in philosophical topics such as “nature” and “destiny” have invariably turned to study history. This is precisely why it is so excellent.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-76" id="calibre_link-152" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">72</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1417" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Modern interpreters generally believe that by this statement Zhang referred only to the Eastern Zhejiang tradition during the Qing Period, because it is obviously untenable if extended earlier than the seventeenth century.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-77" id="calibre_link-153" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">73</a></small></sup> This turns out not to be the case, however. In his “Biography of Shao Jinhan” (Shao Yutong Biezhuan), also written in 1800, he said explicitly: “Since the Southern Song, Confucian philosophers in Eastern Zhejiang by and large devoted themselves to historical scholarship as a way to study such topics as ‘nature’ and ‘destiny.’ This tradition passed from generation to generation.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-78" id="calibre_link-154" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">74</a></small></sup> It is beside the point to say that Zhang exaggerated his case incredibly, which he indeed did. The real question is why he did it. As far as I can discern, he was probably suggesting two points. First, since according to the theory of “the Six Classics are all history,” the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is fully revealed only in history, the long tradition from which he comes has been on the right track all along. Eastern Zhejiang philosophers never engaged in “empty talk”; they did philosophy by way of history. Second, the dominant paradigm in Confucian learning from Gu Yanwu to Dai Zhen must now be radically modified. Instead of “the proper study of principles is the study of classics” (<i class="calibre9">jingxue ji lixue</i>), he would propose to say “the proper study of principles is the study of history” (<i class="calibre9">shixue ji lixue</i> <span>史</span><span>學</span><span>即</span><span>理</span><span>學</span>). This seems implicit in his exaggerated statement about the Eastern Zhejiang tradition since the Southern Song. Thus, the two justly famous theses in his <i class="calibre9">General Principles of Literature and History</i> turn out to reinforce each other and jointly form a powerful argument against Dai’s classical philologism. With this last essay, Zhang concluded his long intellectual struggle with Dai at the very end of his life.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The significance of Zhang’s two Neo-Confucian genealogies, however, far transcends the personal dimension of his intellectual development. With all their imperfections, the two genealogies nevertheless reveal Zhang’s profundity and incisiveness as an intellectual historian who alone among his contemporaries penetrated beneath the surface of textual studies to discover the deeper meanings of the apparently thoughtless activities of mid-Qing philologists. This is not to suggest, of course, that he made this discovery wholly unaided. As shown above, his final views on both Neo-Confucian traditions in the Qing Period evolved over decades as his response to the challenge of Dai’s classical philologism gradually deepened. As he followed Dai’s work closely, at some point it must have dawned on him that behind much of Dai’s anti&ndash;Zhu Xi talk on philological grounds, there was a hidden philosophical project that was nevertheless continuous from Zhu Xi.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1126" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Philologists in eighteenth-century China including Dai, almost without exception, counterposed their own philologically orientated Han Learning to the metaphysical speculation of Song Learning. This Han-Song opposition implies that a complete rupture occurred between Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism and Qing classical scholarship in the mid-seventeenth century. Zhang, as far as I am aware, never took part in this type of discourse; we have yet to discover in his writings that he took the Han Learning&ndash;Song Learning distinction as meaningful. From his point of view, both Neo-Confucian traditions continued well into the Qing Period. What did change was the frame of mind, with “honoring the moral nature” (<i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i>) giving way to “following the path of inquiry and study” (<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>). He was aware, perhaps more fully than most contemporary scholars, that his was an age of <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> and, what is more, he accepted it wholeheartedly. In this sense, he not only shared Dai’s intellectualist outlook but also, like Dai, assumed the responsibility as a philosophical spokesman for Qing Confucian intellectualism. There is a difference, however, in that while Dai may be construed as a spokesman from the Zhu Xi tradition,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-79" id="calibre_link-155" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">75</a></small></sup> Zhang’s apologia for Confucian intellectualism was clearly made from the Lu-Wang position.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It was relatively easy and straightforward for Zhang to demonstrate that Dai was, in fact, a latter-day heir to Zhu Xi. After all, <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> has been traditionally accepted as a built-in feature of the Zhu Xi tradition. On the other hand, his effort to bring the Lu-Wang tradition into accord with Qing intellectualism was a heroic one. His arguments are complex, circuitous, and, at times, even tortuous. One or two examples may be given here. He often emphasized that in learning, one must first see the “large whole” (<i class="calibre9">dati</i> <span>大</span><span>體</span>) rather than getting lost in details. This is, needless to say, a reference to the Mencian idea of “establishing the nobler part of one’s nature” as particularly emphasized by Lu Xiangshan. In Mencius and Lu Xiangshan, this “large whole” could only mean a person’s “moral nature.” But for Zhang, it turned out to be an intellectual ability to grasp holistically the central significance of things. Sometimes he also referred to this as <i class="calibre9">zhuanjia</i>, which literally means “specialist” or “specialization.” We must not confuse it with the term “specialist” in the modern sense, however. What his <i class="calibre9">zhuanjia</i> “specializes” in is none other than the hedgehog’s “one big thing.” Let us take another example. In some of his essays, he made references to Wang Yangming’s <i class="calibre9">zhi liangzhi</i> <span>致</span><span>良</span><span>知</span> (extending good-knowing), which again is moral in nature. In Zhang’s hands, however, <i class="calibre9">liangzhi</i> <span>良</span><span>知</span> also took an intellectualistic turn. What he meant by that term is but a scholar’s intuitive inclination toward a particular type of intellectual work.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-80" id="calibre_link-156" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">76</a></small></sup> In this way, he intellectualized the Lu-Wang tradition to suit the needs of his Eastern Zhejiang historical scholarship. With the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> historicized on the one hand and the Lu-Wang tradition intellectualized on the other, he succeeded in raising Confucian intellectualism to a new height in eighteenth-century China.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1104" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">T</span>he best way to characterize Confucianism in the Qing dynasty (hereafter Qing Confucianism) is to contrast it with what is called Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism. Song-Ming Neo-Confucians were primarily moral philosophers debating among themselves endlessly on metaphysical questions such as whether “moral principles” (<i class="calibre9">li</i> <span>理</span>) are inherent in “human nature” (<i class="calibre9">xing</i> <span>性</span>) or in “human mind” (<i class="calibre9">xin</i> <span>心</span>). By contrast, Qing Confucians were, first and foremost, scholars devoting themselves painstakingly to philological explication of classical and historical texts. As a result, the Song-Ming Period witnessed the emergence and development of the rivalry between two major philosophical systems represented, respectively, by the Cheng-Zhu and the Lu-Wang schools, whereas the Qing Period took great pride in having reestablished the Confucian canon on the foundations of critical scholarship aided by the newly sharpened tools of philology. This is precisely why “classical scholarship” (<i class="calibre9">jingxue</i> <span>經</span><span>學</span>) has been generally identified by modern intellectual historians as the quintessence of Qing Confucianism as opposed to metaphysical speculation in Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1259" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As the above contrast clearly indicates, while both Song-Ming Neo-Confucians and Qing Confucians studied the same body of sacred texts, they were nevertheless guided by two entirely different paradigms. Such being the case, it can be safely assumed that a radical paradigm shift must have taken place during the Ming-Qing intellectual transition. An inquiry into the question of why and how this epoch-making shift occurred in the first place will therefore provide us with a convenient point to retrace Qing Confucianism to its origins.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To begin with, it may be straightforwardly stated that the whole process of intellectual change that eventually led to the establishment of textual scholarship as the central task of Confucianism in the Qing Period had been initially triggered and propelled by forces generated from within the Neo-Confucian philosophical development of the sixteenth century. To illustrate this point, two striking examples may be cited from the two opposing sides of Neo-Confucianism. In 1518, Wang Yangming <span>王</span><span>陽</span><span>明</span> (1472&ndash;1529) made a great effort to restore what he called “the Old Text of the <i class="calibre9">Great Learning</i>” (<i class="calibre9">Daxue guben</i> <span>大</span><span>學</span><span>古</span><span>本</span>) with the explicit purpose of challenging the textual authority established by Zhu Xi in the twelfth century. The latter, as we all know, made some subtle rearrangement and emendation of the <i class="calibre9">Great Learning</i> to support his philosophical position, which has since been accepted as the standard text. Now, Wang Yangming needed the same text to ground his philosophical views, which are the opposite of Zhu Xi’s. It was this need that pushed him into the domain of textual research. This is clearly shown in his most important philosophical synopsis, entitled “Inquiry on the ‘Great Learning’ ” (Daxue zhangju), which is based wholly on his 1518 text. Our second example is Luo Qinshun <span>羅</span><span>欽</span><span>順</span> (1465&ndash;1547), a leading philosopher of the Cheng-Zhu school and revered critic of Wang Yangming. His sustained philosophical debate with Wang over the years also contributed much to the rise of textual scholarship. In 1515, Wang made a selection of passages from several dozens of Zhu Xi’s letters and published them three years later under the title <i class="calibre9">Zhuzi wannian dinglun</i> <span>朱</span><span>子</span><span>晚</span><span>年</span><span>定</span><span>論</span> (Zhu Xi’s final conclusions arrived at late in life).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2065" id="calibre_link-2083" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> The purpose of this whole exercise, according to his preface, was to show that in his later years, Zhu Xi had abandoned his earlier mistaken views and arrived at conclusions similar to those now held by Wang. This work, however, drew harsh criticism from Luo, who pointed out, rightly, that many of the passages are from letters that can be easily dated to the early life of Zhu Xi. In his reply, Wang conceded that he did, indeed, fail to pay sufficient attention to the problem of dating. This exchange between Luo and Wang further testifies to the ever-growing importance of textual criticism in late Ming Neo-Confucian controversies. What is even more significant is Luo’s novel methodological suggestion regarding how the endless metaphysical dispute in Neo-Confucianism can be ultimately settled. Defending Zhu Xi’s theory of “the nature is principle (<i class="calibre9">xing ji li</i> <span>性</span><span>即</span><span>理</span>)” against Wang’s “the mind is principle (<i class="calibre9">xin ji li</i> <span>心</span><span>即</span><span>理</span>),” he quoted extensively from a variety of classical texts in support of his case. In concluding, he argued: “If one carries on his studies without seeking evidence in the classics and is utterly arbitrary and opinionated it is inevitable that he will be misled. It is wrong to allow oneself to be misled, worse yet to mislead others.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2066" id="calibre_link-2084" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> Here the very notion of “seeking evidence in the classics” turned out to be quite prophetic about where Confucianism was to be heading, for “evidential investigation” (<i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i> <span>考</span><span>證</span>) constituted the central methodological principle of Qing classical scholarship.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1194" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>To be sure, neither Wang nor Luo can be called a textual scholar. By getting themselves involved in textual entanglements even to such a limited degree, both philosophers nevertheless set examples, rather unwittingly, for others to follow. As a result, the two rival Neo-Confucian schools, Cheng-Zhu versus Lu-Wang, were moving their battlefield from philosophy to philology in an ever-increasingly fast pace.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>By general consensus, Gu Yanwu <span>顧</span><span>炎</span><span>武</span> (1613&ndash;1682) was the founding father of Qing classical scholarship; the new paradigm of research he established practically dominated the world of learning throughout the Qing Period. As also commonly held, he was more responsible than anyone else for turning Confucian scholars away from metaphysical speculation, and at the same time, opening up the field of classical study based on textual evidence. However, his break with Neo-Confucianism was by no means complete. Contrary to the long-established view since Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929), Gu did not dismiss or attack Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism summarily and indiscriminately. Of the two major Neo-Confucian schools, he was clearly partial to the Zhu Xi tradition and all of his sharp criticisms were directed against Wang Yangming and his followers. This is especially shown in his enthusiastic endorsement of Luo Qinshun in the latter’s debate with Wang Yangming on the question of Zhu Xi’s <i class="calibre9">Final Conclusions</i> mentioned above. Moreover, Gu’s famous and influential statement that “the proper study of moral principles consists primarily in the study of the classics” can also be read as his answering to Luo’s clarion call “to seek evidence in the classics.” It is true that Gu departed from the Ming Neo-Confucian tradition by shunning metaphysics altogether. However, insofar as Gu also emphasized that the ultimate purpose of his advocacy of textual research on the classics was to bring the Confucian Way to light (<i class="calibre9">mingdao</i> <span>明</span><span>道</span>), he was still carrying on the same sacred mission as did his Neo-Confucian predecessors, but taking an entirely different path.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2067" id="calibre_link-2085" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1112" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The above account suggests two closely related points of considerable historical importance with regard to the transition from Ming Neo-Confucianism to Qing Confucianism. First, it was the inner logic of the Neo-Confucian development as exemplified, especially, in its endless metaphysical controversies that pushed itself to a point at which reexamination of the original texts became absolutely necessary. This is the case because Neo-Confucian thinkers of all persuasions had to validate their claims to knowledge of the Confucian Way by citing the authority of these texts. Thus, they initiated a movement that may be most appropriately described as “return to the sources”&mdash;a movement that took more than a century for Qing Confucian scholars to bring to completion. Second, at the methodological level, the Ming-Qing intellectual transition can indeed be defined in terms of a shift from the philosophical to the philological approach. In this sense, the transition may be viewed as more characteristically discontinuous than continuous. The discontinuity involved here is also a matter of degree, however, for the philological turn had already begun with some of the philosophical followers of Wang Yangming in the late Ming, notably Jiao Hong <span>焦</span><span>竑</span> (1540&ndash;1620), who, quite remarkably, opened up several areas of textual research only to be fully developed by early Qing scholars. In view of these two closely related points, it would make little sense to take the beginning of Qing Confucianism to be a sudden and negative reaction to Ming Neo-Confucianism, as suggested by the received wisdom. Instead, it was not only largely continuous with but also necessitated by the internal development of Ming Neo-Confucianism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1215" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This continuity is nowhere more clearly shown than in the textual criticism developed in early Qing. Two outstanding examples may be given to substantiate this observation. First, in 1654, Chen Que <span>陳</span><span>確</span> (1604&ndash;1677) wrote a famous essay on the text of the <i class="calibre9">Great Learning</i> that immediately created a stir in the academic community. Through textual analysis and terminological comparisons with other ancient sources, he came to the conclusion that the <i class="calibre9">Great Learning</i> is a document of much later date and therefore must be rejected as a sacred text directly linked to the teaching of Confucius. In his view, Wang Yangming could have well saved the trouble to restore the “ancient text” had he only known that the very authenticity of the <i class="calibre9">Great Learning</i> as a Confucian text is in serious question. As a follower of Wang Yangming, however, he openly admitted that the main point he was making in this textual study was a philosophical one, namely, to demolish the textual basis of Zhu Xi’s theory about the relationship between “knowing” and “acting.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2068" id="calibre_link-2086" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup> Second, from the 1670s on, Yan Ruoju <span>閻</span><span>若</span><span>璩</span> (1636&ndash;1704) began to engage himself in a long-term research project on the sixteen chapters in the “ancient script” <i class="calibre9">Guwen Shangshu</i> <span>古</span><span>文</span><span>尚</span><span>書</span> (Classic of History), whose authenticity had long been suspect since Zhu Xi. In the end, Yan was able to prove once and for all that they were indeed forgeries of the fourth century <small class="calibre7">C.E.</small> It is significant to note, however, that in this study of a purely philological nature, Yan made every effort to place himself squarely in the Zhu Xi tradition of Neo-Confucianism. He not only specifically acknowledged his indebtedness to Zhu Xi for having initiated him into this project but also, more important, professed to cling to the latter’s general intellectual position that Confucian moral principles must be grounded in a deep understanding of classical texts. It is also strikingly odd that in this book, Yan interspersed his textual analysis with harsh attacks on Lu Xiangshan <span>陸</span><span>象</span><span>山</span> (1139&ndash;1192) and Wang Yangming. When Mao Qiling <span>毛</span><span>奇</span><span>齡</span> (1623&ndash;1716) read an early draft of Yan’s study, he was so furious that he immediately set out to write a refutation of it also on evidential grounds. As a follower of Wang Yangming, he was keenly aware of the negative philosophical implications of Yan’s work for the Lu-Wang school as a whole, for one of the forged chapters contains a passage about “the mind of man versus the mind of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>,” which he took to be a textual basis more crucial to the School of Mind (<i class="calibre9">xinxue</i> <span>心</span><span>學</span>) of his own day. From his letters to Yan, it is clear that his defense of the chapters of the <i class="calibre9">History</i> in ancient script was actually a defense of his own philosophical position.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">2</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>With the full flowering of classical studies in the second half of the eighteenth century, Qing Confucianism reached its peak. By this time, the philological tools of various kinds including, especially, etymology, phonology, paleography, and collation had been developed to near technical perfection. By applying these new techniques to the study of classical and historical texts in a systematic and sustained manner, mainstream Confucians in the mid-Qing Period radically changed our understanding of the Confucian canon. As a matter of fact, mid-Qing Confucians were not only very much excited about this unique contribution of theirs to the Confucian tradition but also took great pride in it. Justified or not, they consistently believed that it is philology, not metaphysical speculation, that can unlock the door to the classical world of ancient sages. This general sense of excitement and pride is best expressed in the following powerful statement made by Dai Zhen <span>戴</span><span>震</span> (1724&ndash;1777) in 1765:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Alas, if the so-called moral principles of the sages can be obtained by sheer speculation apart from the classics, then anyone is able to grasp them out of emptiness. If that is the case, what do we need classical scholarship for? It is precisely because free speculation cannot lead one to a proper understanding of the moral principles of the ancient sages that one has to seek it from the ancient classics. Since messages contained in the surviving records have gradually fallen into oblivion due to the expanse of time between the past and the present, one therefore has to seek them through philological studies of the classical texts. Thus, only if philology is clear can the ancient classics be understood, and only if the classics are understood, can the sages’ moral principles then be grasped.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2069" id="calibre_link-2087" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1244" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This statement is clearly a further elaboration of Gu Yanwu’s original proposal that “the proper study of moral principles consists primarily in the study of the classics.” It not only makes more explicit Gu’s deep distrust of metaphysical speculation but also argues more cogently for the central importance of philology in classical scholarship. It may be noted, however, that when Gu first introduced the paradigm change a century earlier, he merely indicated in general terms that “the right way of reading the classics must begin with a thorough investigation of the language in which they are expressed” but did not go much further.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2070" id="calibre_link-2088" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> This difference between Gu and Dai testifies to the enormous growth of classical scholarship during the century that separated the two Confucian scholars. It was on the foundation of this accumulative scholarship that Dai was able to give philological methodology a most precise and clear formulation.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Qing Confucianism assumed its most distinctive shape during the Qianlong reign (1736&ndash;1795), as the learned world in Qing China entered its most creative period. We must now try to describe that distinctive shape in its own terms with a view to determining more precisely the nature and place of Qing Confucianism in the history of Chinese thought.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To begin with, it is important to know how Qing Confucianism was perceived by its own advocates. In this connection, a keen observation made by Gong Zizhen <span>龔</span><span>自</span><span>珍</span> (1792&ndash;1841) serves our purpose admirably well. Gong was personally trained in all kinds of classical philology by his maternal grandfather, Duan Yucai <span>段</span><span>玉</span><span>裁</span> (1735&ndash;1815), the leading disciple of Dai Zhen, and later became a founder of the New Text school. With these credentials, what he had to say about Qing Confucianism certainly deserves our serious attention. In 1817, he reflected on the state of Confucian learning in his day as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The Confucian Way consists of two main strands, namely, “honoring the moral nature” (<i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> <span>尊</span><span>德</span><span>性</span>) and “following the path of inquiry and study” (<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i> <span>道</span><span>問</span><span>學</span>). In its original conception, these two strands are supposed not to contradict but rather lend support to each other. However, in actual practice, it turns out that each of the two approaches to the Way tends to dominate the learned world in a given period. The expected harmonious unity between the two has never been realized. As a result, the majority of Confucian scholars merely follow whichever approach happens to be dominant in their own times. With the founding of our dynasty, the scope of Confucian studies has been enormously broadened. However, ours is an age dominated by the mode of intellectual inquiry. Thus, since the beginning of the Qianlong era (1736&ndash;1795), “inquiry and study” has been established as the standard requirement which a Confucian must meet by definition.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2071" id="calibre_link-2089" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1063" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Before we can explore the full implications of this important statement, however, a word of clarification is in order. The two key terms, <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> and <i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>, are taken from the “Zhongyong” (Doctrine of the Mean), referring, respectively, to moral cultivation and intellectual inquiry. Generally speaking, in the Neo-Confucian context, both approaches are conceived to be relevant to man’s quest for <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. The moral approach consists primarily in the awakening of moral faith by way of meditation and metaphysical speculation. By contrast, the intellectual approach implies that every advance in our knowledge of the world brings us a step closer to the total understanding of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, and only by “inquiry and study” can knowledge be acquired, whether it concerns knowledge of a classical text or that of “a blade of grass.” It was precisely the difference in emphasis of these two approaches that philosophically divided the Cheng-Zhu school and the Lu-Wang school. By and large, the former took both as equally important for the attainment of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, whereas the latter not only entrusted the central role to the moral approach but also assigned intellectual inquiry to a place of insignificance.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>When Gong used these two terms, he generally followed this Neo-Confucian distinction between the moral approach and the intellectual approach. However, in suggesting that Qing Confucianism was dominated by “intellectual inquiry,” he had specifically in mind the prevailing mode of classical scholarship of his own time. By the mid-eighteenth century at the latest, there was a general consensus among mainstream Confucian scholars that the original philosophical messages of ancient sages had been grossly misinterpreted by Song-Ming Neo-Confucian thinkers who, under the influence of Buddhism, relied too heavily on metaphysical speculation. The only reliable method to recapture the original meanings of ancient Confucianism, they insisted, was to subject every classical text to a most rigorous and critical examination based on the newly developed philology. What Gong meant by “intellectual inquiry” (<i class="calibre9">dao wenxue</i>) in the above-quoted statement must be understood in this light.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>We are now in a position to evaluate in more general terms the unique contribution of Qing Confucianism in the history of Chinese thought. In sharp contrast to the Neo-Confucian metaphysical speculation on “moral nature” from Song to Ming, Confucianism in the Qing Period took a decidedly intellectualistic turn. As a result, the study of the classics was fully justified as a Confucian calling. It has been widely held, however, that since Qing Confucianism was concerned wholly with textual scholarship, it involved little or no philosophical thinking on the part of its practitioners. While this view may well have been applicable to many individual cases of mid-Qing classicists who carried on normal research within the philological paradigm, it nevertheless fails to make sense of Confucian intellectualism as a sustained learned movement throughout the Qing Period, which, viewed holistically, does reveal a central philosophical vision radically different from Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism. This new vision is nowhere more clearly shown than in some of the ways in which the Confucian tradition was redefined by Dai Zhen and Zhang Xuecheng <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span> (1739&ndash;1801), the two leading philosophical spokesmen of the learned world in eighteenth-century China.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1218" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In his early years, Dai was a close philosophical follower of Zhu Xi. As clearly shown in his 1750 essay on the question of moral cultivation versus intellectual inquiry, he defended Zhu Xi’s pedagogical emphasis on the latter on the one hand and criticized the exclusive attention of the Lu-Wang school to the former on the other. With regard to the relative importance between “principle” (<i class="calibre9">li</i>) and “mind” (<i class="calibre9">xin</i>) in Confucian philosophy, he also honored the former with a more basic status. With the intellectual component in the Cheng-Zhu tradition as his starting point, he later developed a philosophy uniquely characteristic of his own age in which Confucian intellectualism reigned supreme. Here, one or two examples will suffice for the purpose of illustration. First, his final, definitive view about how moral nature stands in relation to intellectual inquiry and study particularly merits attention. In his later philosophical writings, he clearly moved beyond the moral-intellectual duality in the Cheng-Zhu tradition and came to a position that may be described as intellectual monism. Consequently, he seriously questioned the distinction between moral knowledge and intellectual knowledge, a distinction central to all Neo-Confucianists irrespective of sectarian differences. In this regard, his analogy between man’s physical body and his moral nature is highly illuminating. As he argues, “[The] physical body begins with infancy and ends up with adulthood. So in the same manner, man’s moral nature begins with unenlightened ignorance and ends up with sagely intelligence. [The] physical body grows only because it feeds on nutrition from drinking and eating. Similarly, moral nature also feeds itself on learning and inquiry in order to develop into sagely intelligence.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2072" id="calibre_link-2090" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> In this formulation, moral nature is practically redefined as if it were epiphenomenal to intellectual inquiry. Second, Dai also took over the key concept of <i class="calibre9">li</i> (“principles”) from Zhu Xi and again intellectualized it to serve his own philosophical purposes. He rejected the orthodox Neo-Confucian conception of <i class="calibre9">li</i> as a completely self-sufficient metaphysical entity that “man acquires from Heaven and holds in mind.” Instead, based on etymological evidence, he redefined <i class="calibre9">li</i> in terms of “internal texture of things.” It therefore follows that the only way to discover such “principles” is through intellectual inquiry. In his own words, “With regard to principles of things, they can be established only after things in question are analytically studied with utmost thoroughness.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2073" id="calibre_link-2091" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> Thus, he transformed <i class="calibre9">li</i> from a Neo-Confucian idea of a priori moral principles, which transcend and yet give shape and meaning to things, to something like “laws” or “patterns,” which are inherent in things and thereby constitute the very object of knowledge on the part of man.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It may be further noted, however, what Dai did to the concept of <i class="calibre9">li</i>, <i class="calibre9">mutalis mutandis</i>, applies to the idea of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> as well. He also refused to see <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> as a metaphysical entity. Instead, he took <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> to be the way or ways in which the world, including the natural and the human, ceaselessly evolves. The way one seeks to understand <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, according to him, is also the way one obtains knowledge about <i class="calibre9">li</i>, or “principles,” of things. Hence, his famous remark “The <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> to be reached above is the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> to be learned below,” which clearly implies that <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> can be known only by going through the normal intellectual process even though a higher level of synthesis and abstraction is involved.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2074" id="calibre_link-2092" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1105" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>There can be little doubt that the philosophical system Dai eventually completed toward the end of his life is a radically intellectualistic one. To the extent that it identifies “intellect” as the most distinguishing characteristic of human nature and elevates “knowledge” to a pivotal position in Confucian learning, his philosophy marks the beginning of a new phase in the history of Confucianism. For the first time, the centuries-old absolute presupposition that man’s innate moral sense is the foundation of all intellectual creativities was seriously questioned. It is true that Dai still subscribed to the Mencian view about the moral seed in every human heart. Nevertheless, he argued forcefully that the moral seed will not grow to fruition unless and until planted on fertile intellectual soil. It is indeed no exaggeration to say that he regarded morality as a product of knowledge.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As shown above, Dai Zhen began his intellectualism from within the Cheng-Zhu tradition but in the end, he went far beyond the prescribed limits of that tradition. By contrast, Zhang Xuecheng came from the Lu-Wang background and made every effort to intellectualize its moralistic system. Highly sensitive to the rapidly changing climate of opinion of the eighteenth century, he practically embraced most of the intellectualistic assumptions of contemporary Confucian classicists. Like the majority of Qing Confucians, he believed that only original scholarship, not speculation, can lead to a true understanding of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. His version of intellectualism is nowhere more characteristically revealed than in his repeated attempts at a reconstruction of the two major Neo-Confucian genealogies: the Cheng-Zhu versus the Lu-Wang. Toward the end of his life, he drew up altogether two lists of names representing the lines of transmission of the two contending schools. Several observations may be made with regard to these two reconstructed genealogies. To begin with, his explicitly stated criteria of selection are illuminating. According to him, an intellectual heir to either Zhu Xi or Lu Xiangshan must meet two basic requirements: positively, he must be comprehensively knowledgeable about the classics and respectful of tradition; negatively, he must not engage in “empty talk on moral nature.” As a result, those included in his lists are mostly “scholars” rather than “philosophers.” Second, he no longer took the difference between Zhu and Lu as intellectual inquiry versus moral cultivation. Instead, he saw it as the inevitable expressions of two opposing tendencies in man’s intellectual nature. Those who tend to grasp intuitively the significance of things and see things in large wholes would become followers of the Lu-Wang school, whereas those who tend to pursue knowledge of a vast number of subjects as well as at various levels would become followers of the Cheng-Zhu school. What is referred to above as “intuitive grasp of the significance of things” is actually Zhang’s redefinition of the term <i class="calibre9">zun dexing</i> (honoring moral nature). It is indeed remarkable that he was able to turn such a central Confucian notion about moral nature into something purely intellectual without apparently showing traces of deep psychological tension. In the very same manner, he also intellectualized Wang Yangming’s idea of <i class="calibre9">liangzhi</i> <span>良</span><span>知</span> (innate knowledge of good) by reinterpreting it as a scholar’s intuitive inclination toward a particular type of intellectual work, be it classics, history, or poetry.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1349" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Last but not least, his justly famous thesis, “The Six Classics are all history,” was also part and parcel of the rising Confucian intellectualism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2075" id="calibre_link-2093" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> According to his reconstructed genealogies, Qing classical scholars from Gu Yanwu to Dai Zhen were the true heirs of the Cheng-Zhu school, whereas Eastern Zhejiang historians from Huang Zongxi <span>黃</span><span>宗</span><span>羲</span> (1610&ndash;1695) and Quan Zuwang <span>全</span><span>祖</span><span>望</span> (1705&ndash;1755) to Zhang himself developed the Lu-Wang tradition in a new direction. Instead of engaging in “empty talk” on such general principles as “human nature” and “destiny,” Eastern Zhejiang historians have always, said Zhang, devoted themselves to historical scholarship to show how these principles actually operated in concrete human situations. In this connection, it is important to point out that Zhang’s famous thesis was formulated with the specific purpose of challenging the classicists’ monopolistic claim to the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. As shown earlier, a generally accepted assumption among Qing scholars under the new paradigm was that the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> discovered by sages of antiquity is all recorded in the classical texts and that the newly refined philological tools are capable of explicating the original meanings of these texts. Zhang considered this conception of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> fundamentally mistaken. To him, <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> was but the quintessence of the civilized way of life and as such, it constantly evolved in history. Ancient sages did not create the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>; they only discerned it in the everyday social activity of men and women. In his view, therefore, the Six Classics as historical texts of ancient sages could only reveal the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> as it had evolved up to the end of classical antiquity. They could not possibly say anything about the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> as it continued to manifest itself in the course of events and changes in later times. The real message behind Zhang’s thesis is thus unmistakable: the classicist, insofar as his specialization is confined to the texts of the Six Classics, is by definition incapable of seeing the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> fully. On the other hand, it is the historian with a comprehensive understanding of the historical process from the past to the present who is eminently qualified to grasp the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in its essentials. In this way, he pushed intellectualism beyond the limit of the dominant paradigm of the classicists from Gu Yanwu to Dai Zhen. Critical inquiry and study as a methodological principle, he insisted, must extend to texts of all varieties, not merely the Six Classics, because historical and literary scholarship has a claim to the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> no less legitimate than classical scholarship. Thus, we see that he greatly broadened the intellectual base of Confucianism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1372" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The extent to which Zhang intellectualized the Lu-Wang tradition may be most clearly shown by a brief contrast with its Song-Ming Neo-Confucian version. For Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming, <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> or <i class="calibre9">li</i> (principles) and the mind (<i class="calibre9">xin</i>) are really indistinguishable whether the concept of mind is understood in its cosmic or individual sense. They generally assumed that <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> and the mind share the same spiritual substances of which the moral order as we find it in the cosmos or in the human world is constituted. This is precisely why Neo-Confucians of the Lu-Wang persuasion always emphasized that in our quest for <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, the moral approach must take precedence over the intellectual approach. By moral approach, it is meant that the “original mind” (Lu) or “innate knowledge” (Wang) be followed at all times as our infallible guide. The intellectual approach, on the other hand, is at best peripheral and at worst misleading because <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, being internal to the mind, cannot be studied from without as if it were an ordinary object of knowledge. In Zhang’s intellectualized system, by contrast, “history” takes the place of “mind” and, consequently, <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> and history are viewed as the inside and the outside of each other. <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in itself is indeed “above form” and therefore inaccessible to direct observation. However, we can instead grasp in understanding the invisible <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> by tracing its historical process of objectification. Thus, to know <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is to know history. As a historian, he apparently did not believe that there was an a priori shortcut to knowledge of the past.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Finally, Zhang’s self-definition as a follower of the Lu-Wang tradition also made it necessary for him to assign the concept of mind (<i class="calibre9">xin</i>) a proper place in his system of thought. However, when he came to grips with this problem, it turned out that he was once more well served by his most favorite strategy, namely, intellectualization. The pivotal function of the mind is emphatically stressed in his discussions about how to reconstruct the past. As a genealogist of philosophical schools and historian of ideas, he often spoke in such a way as if the final goal of explicating a text was to transcend language in order to get at the thoughts of its author. His direct borrowing of the Chan Buddhist expression “transmission from mind to mind without a written text” (<i class="calibre9">fawai chuanxin</i> <span>法</span><span>外</span><span>傳</span><span>心</span>) further testifies, in particular, to the influence of Lu Xiangshan, who advocated more enthusiastically than any other Neo-Confucian thinker that moral ideas of ancient sages be directly grasped through a transhistorical meeting of minds.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2076" id="calibre_link-2094" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> However, it can be easily demonstrated that the “mind” Zhang speaks of throughout his writings is a pure knowing mind without the built-in moral substance of what Lu called the “original mind.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1227" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In keeping with Zhang’s redefinition of the rivalry between the two major Neo-Confucian schools in terms of the opposing tendencies in man’s intellectual temper, he made another strategic move by developing a methodology uniquely suited to the type of scholarship he was then advocating in order to counterbalance the radical philology so exceedingly glorified by his contemporary classicists. At first he also shared the classicist’s enthusiasm about philology as a sharp tool capable of bringing to light messages of the sages hidden in classical texts. However, as his own distinct point of view about the Confucian tradition was being gradually crystallized, in time he grew increasingly critical of the philological approach as practiced in his day. His main complaint about philology was that it was effective only in getting to know the details through textual exegesis but quite inadequate to the task of grasping the large whole. This is the case because, in his eyes, the philologist fails, more often than not, to rise above the language of the text and penetrate into the thought of the author. To avoid getting lost in details in the search for <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, he therefore proposed to establish a new methodology with “grasp of the large whole” and “leap into the minds of the ancients” as two basic principles. As we know, these two principles were originally formulated by Lu Xiangshan to serve the purpose of moral cultivation. The two key terms “large whole” (<i class="calibre9">dati</i> <span>大</span><span>體</span>) and “mind” (<i class="calibre9">xin</i>) are taken from Mencius, referring to man’s moral nature and moral mind, respectively. Zhang retained the old terms but transferred them from the moral to the intellectual domain. He had to make this subtle but profound change because he was faced with a question wholly different from that of his predecessors. For Lu-Wang Neo-Confucians, the primary question was “How to become a sage?” For Qing Confucian scholars, however, the very first question they must seek to answer was rather “How can we be sure that we understand the ideas of ancient sages correctly?” It was his dissatisfaction with the classicist’s answer to this question that prompted him to offer his own methodological principles with a distinctive Lu-Wang undertone. In this particular area, his intellectualization of the Lu-Wang tradition consists of two interrelated moves. First, the original moral approach with its special emphasis on the transhistorical meeting of minds was transformed into methods of interpretation and understanding allowing the possibility of getting hold of the authorial intent of a given text through as well as beyond its language. Second, the notion that the search for <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> must begin with a firm grasp of the “large whole” (<i class="calibre9">dati</i>) also provided a model for his methodological formulation. To the radical philological point of view that mastery of every technical detail is prerequisite to the understanding of a given text as a whole he opposed the principle that grasp of the whole alone can give meaning to scholarly research and determine the relevance of technical details to a chosen subject matter. Put in more general terms, he may well be characterized as a methodological holist particularly concerned with the relation of parts to the whole in interpretation. With the formulation of methodological holism, his intellectualization of the Lu-Wang tradition became complete.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Dai Zhen and Zhang Xuecheng were the two most philosophically minded scholars who happened to live in the era when Confucian intellectualism reached its pinnacle. The former was a philologically oriented classicist coming from the Cheng-Zhu background, while the latter was an intellectual historian identifying himself as a custodian of the Lu-Wang tradition. Together, their new and divergent conceptions about the Confucian tradition sum up exceedingly well the multifarious developments of mainstream Confucianism to the end of the eighteenth century. In this sense, Dai and Zhang are expressing not only their own views but also those of their predecessors, including Gu Yanwu, Huang Zongxi, Chen Que, Wang Fuzhi <span>王</span><span>夫</span><span>之</span> (1619&ndash;1693), and Yan Yuan <span>顏</span><span>元</span> (1635&ndash;1704).</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">3</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1247" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>While the main emphasis and contribution of mid-Qing Confucianism lay primarily in the domain of classical and historical scholarship, new developments in political and social thought also took place in early and late Qing. A brief account of them is now in order.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To begin with, the Confucian idea of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> <span>經</span><span>世</span> (ordering the world) requires a word of clarification. Broadly speaking, the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is always expected to function in two major categories that correspond, respectively, to the classical expression of “sageliness within and kingliness without” (<i class="calibre9">neisheng waiwang</i> <span>內</span><span>聖</span><span>外</span><span>王</span>). In the Song-Ming Neo-Confucian context, the former refers to the cultivation of moral nature and the latter to “putting the world in order,” that is, <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i>. Being this-worldly in nature, the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is ultimately to seek full realization in the human world, not merely contented with salvation of the individual by way of moral cultivation. This is precisely why Zhu Xi’s Four Books is headed by the <i class="calibre9">Great Learning</i>, for as a general outline of the whole Confucian project, this particular text states in no uncertain terms that the process of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>’s realization begins with moral cultivation of the self but ends with “order of the state” and “peace of the world,” which are what <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> is all about. Such being the case, it is little wonder that the notion of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> was deeply rooted in the consciousness of many a devout Confucian whose irresistible impulse to put the world in order often broke out in times of extreme adversity and chaos. Under such circumstances, almost as a rule, many Confucians would throw themselves into political and social action by either promoting reform or voicing protest, or both.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Having thus clarified the role of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> in the Confucian scheme of things, let us proceed to review the functional dimension of the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> during the Qing Period. The <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> anxiety seized Confucian consciousness twice during the Qing, first in the seventeenth century and later in the nineteenth, both responding to a sustained political and social crisis.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1277" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The first <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> movement actually started during the late Ming but continued into the early Qing. The Manchu conquest in 1644, needless to say, shocked all the Confucians beyond measure and thereby further deepened their consciousness of the political and social crisis. Take the first generation of Qing Confucians as an example: divergent as their intellectual orientations were, Gu Yanwu, Huang Zongxi, and Wang Fuzhi all emphasized that the ultimate importance of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> lies in its wondrous function to set things right when the human world goes terribly wrong. As a matter of fact, it was this Confucian impulse toward “reordering the world” that initially prompted them to restudy the Six Classics with the avowed purpose of clarifying the true nature of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. As Gu Yanwu clearly stated, “I decided not to do any writing unless it had a relation to the actual affairs of the contemporary world as indicated in the Six Classics.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2077" id="calibre_link-2095" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> It was his firm belief that only a thoroughgoing study of the classics can bring <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> to light, which in turn will save the world from all of its current troubles. Huang Zongxi went a step further. He proposed to enlarge the core of Confucian learning by combining the study of classics with that of history, especially history of the most recent past, for whether the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> can function to improve the world hinges, according to him, entirely on whether its practitioners can make creative use of historical experience to solve contemporary problems. Here we see how he started an intellectual tradition in Eastern Zhejiang that culminated in the work of Zhang Xuecheng. A similar view was also independently developed by Wang Fuzhi, who anticipated Zhang’s definition of the aim of historical studies in terms of “setting the world in order” (<i class="calibre9">jingshi</i>) by a full century.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The pervasive <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> trend continued well into the second generation, of which Li Yong <span>李</span><span>顒</span> (1627&ndash;1705) and Yan Yuan may be taken as the two most outstanding representatives. Li was a Neo-Confucian philosopher from Shaanxi who largely followed the teaching of Wang Yangming but also gave due recognition to the contributions of the Cheng-Zhu school. Throughout his life, however, he never strayed from his Confucian idealism centering around the notion of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i>. Among his early works, several bear the titles of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> and “current affairs.” In reply to a disciple in 1656, he made the categorical statement that “the central purpose of Confucian learning consists wholly in setting the world in order” as opposed to the Daoist “nonaction” and the Buddhist “nirvana.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2078" id="calibre_link-2096" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> Yan Yuan agreed to this view when he learned of it in 1692. With his overwhelming emphasis on the importance of political and social practice, he transformed late Ming Neo-Confucian quietism into a most radical form of activism. His sages were no longer “sitting” sages but men of action, and his <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> was neither a metaphysical entity nor a linguistic construct but a driving force of the human world constantly in motion. Indeed, of all early Qing thinkers, he alone may be said to have formulated a most powerful philosophy with the Confucian notion of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> at its very center.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>This long-lasting commitment to the ideal of “setting the world in order” during the Ming-Qing transition contributed, to a considerable extent, to a reorientation in Confucian political and social thinking. As a result, a number of noticeable new attitudes and ideas emerged. Due to space, however, only a few may be briefly indicated here.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>First of all, Huang Zongxi’s famous treatise, <i class="calibre9">Mingyi daifang lu</i> <span>明</span><span>夷</span><span>待</span><span>訪</span><span>錄</span> (Waiting for dawn: A plan for the prince), written in 1662, deserves special mention.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2079" id="calibre_link-2097" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> In this little classic, he not only made a most penetrating and devastating criticism of Chinese despotism, especially its Ming version, and all the institutional malfunctions associated with it, but also offered a comprehensive blueprint for restoring the Confucian world to order.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1263" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>On the one hand, the treatise crystallized his lifetime reflections on the deep-rooted troubles that eventually brought about the fall of Ming and the Manchu conquest; on the other hand, it also consolidated his views about the functional dimension of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> developed through a penetrating study of Confucian political principles in the classics vis-<span>à</span>-vis a close reading of dynastic histories beginning with the founding of the first unified empire. This work was enthusiastically received by its earliest readers, who generally hailed it as a set of reform proposals, which, if duly implemented, would “set the world right” (<i class="calibre9">jingshi</i>).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>One of Huang’s arguments against imperial autocracy is particularly indicative of where Confucian political and social thought was heading. It runs roughly as follows: Sovereigns in postclassical times such as the First Emperor of Qin and the founding emperor of Han violated the terms of service originally expected of a universal king. Instead of advancing the interests of the people, they abused the enormous power vested in them by identifying their supreme private interests with the common good of the empire. They looked upon the empire as if it were their private property and, as a result, the people did not even dare to think of their own interests.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>This argument may well be regarded as the sharpest expression of a general sense shared by many a Confucian in the seventeenth century. Gu Yanwu also offered his view as follows: it is in human nature that everyone should care for his own family and cherish his own children. Even if the Son of Heaven loves the people, he still cannot possibly do better than what they can do for themselves. Therefore, the only way for the common good to prevail in the world is for the Son of Heaven to see to it that all people can pursue their legitimate self-interests, each in his individual way. In Gu’s own words, “with all the individual self-interest (<i class="calibre9">si</i> <span>私</span>) in the world combined, the common good (<i class="calibre9">gong</i> <span>公</span>) is formed.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2080" id="calibre_link-2098" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1113" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Obviously, both Huang and Gu revealed a keen sense of distrust as far as the imperial power was concerned. It appears that they finally came to the realization that the centuries-old Neo-Confucian project known as “Bringing <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> to the world with the blessing of the sovereign” (<i class="calibre9">dejun xingdao</i> <span>得</span><span>君</span><span>行</span><span>道</span>) was but an illusion. Consequently, in their efforts to establish a better social and ethical order, often at the local level, through a variety of educational, cultural, and philanthropic activities, they tended to seek support not so much from the state as from the local elite and the wealthy. It is particularly significant that the focus of Confucian economic thinking was steadily shifting to the question of how to protect the wealthy from the state. Huang Zongxi, Gu Yanwu, Wang Fuzhi, and Tang Zhen <span>唐</span><span>甄</span> (1630&ndash;1704), to give only a few notable examples, all insisted that wealth must be kept in local communities in the care of those who created it so that in times of extreme adversity, such as famine, the poor may be provided with immediate assistance or relief. On the other hand, they also emphatically pointed out that if wealth is wholly concentrated in the imperial treasury, then the people will forever be deprived of access to it. Out of this deep skepticism about the function of the state grew a general notion that the operation of public enterprises ought to be entrusted to private entrepreneurs rather than state bureaucrats. As time went on, this notion became increasingly popular among Confucians and eventually was embodied in the system of “official supervision and merchant operation” at the end of the nineteenth century. In this regard, it may be noted, the interpenetration between the emerging business culture and Confucianism since early Qing is unmistakable.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the realm of social, economic, and ethical thought, Qing Confucianism generally exhibited a tendency toward relaxation of moral absolutism. Above, we have seen how Gu Yanwu and Huang Zongxi took “common good” and “self-interest” as mutually complementary. In fact, this new reading is equally applicable to many other Confucian polarities, notably “righteousness versus profitableness,” “frugality versus luxury,” and, above all, “heavenly principle versus human desire.” All these polarities, which had been previously understood as mutually exclusive opposites, were now redefined in relative terms. Of early Qing Confucians, Chen Que did more than anyone else to accord “human desire” a legitimate place in the Confucian scheme of things. His statement that “heavenly principle consists in the proper fulfillment of human desires” anticipated Dai Zhen’s ethical theory by exactly a full century.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2081" id="calibre_link-2099" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> This important revision, in particular, shows how Confucianism reoriented itself toward the changing social and economic realities in the seventeenth century. Needless to say, it was also closely linked to the Confucians’ commitment to the ideal of the amelioration of human affairs (<i class="calibre9">jingshi</i>). As Dai Zhen repeatedly assured his readers, his redefinition of “principles versus desire” was prompted by the simple fact that more often than not, those in power condemn the basic needs of the common people as “human desires” and summarily reject their demands for fulfillment in the name of “heavenly principles.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2082" id="calibre_link-2100" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">4</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1160" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Our account of Qing Confucianism would not be complete without a brief note on the nineteenth century. By the 1820s at the latest, the peak of mainstream Confucianism focused on classical and historical scholarship was over, even though the research tradition continued well into the twentieth century. The nineteenth century witnessed two major departures from mainstream Confucianism. The first was a pervasive revival of the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> consciousness, as clearly marked by the publication in 1827 of an enormous collection of Qing writings on practical matters relating to state and society under the title <i class="calibre9">Huangchao jingshi wenbian</i> <span>皇</span><span>朝</span><span>經</span><span>世</span><span>文</span><span>編</span> (Illustrious Qing dynasty documents on statecraft), edited by He Changling <span>賀</span><span>長</span><span>齡</span> (1785&ndash;1848) and Wei Yuan <span>魏</span><span>源</span> (1794&ndash;1856). It was a revival because the title unmistakably suggests a direct borrowing of Chen Zilong’s <span>陳</span><span>子</span><span>龍</span> <i class="calibre9">Huang Ming jingshi wenbian</i> <span>皇</span><span>明</span><span>經</span><span>世</span><span>文</span><span>編</span> (Illustrious Ming dynasty documents on statecraft) compiled in 1638. Like the rise of the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> movement in the seventeenth century, the revival was also a response to the deepening political, social, and economic crisis since the beginning of the Jiaqing reign (1796&ndash;1820). However, unlike its predecessor two centuries earlier, the revived <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> movement grew rapidly in influence with time, especially after the Opium War of 1839&ndash;1842. From Zeng Guofan <span>曾</span><span>國</span><span>藩</span> (1811&ndash;1872) to Kang Youwei <span>康</span><span>有</span><span>為</span> (1858&ndash;1927), <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> was gradually being established as one of the four major fields of Confucian studies, along with moral philosophy (<i class="calibre9">yili</i> <span>義</span><span>理</span>), philology (<i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i>), and literary art (<i class="calibre9">cizhang</i> <span>詞</span><span>章</span>). Insofar as history figured centrally in <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> studies, the revival was very much continuous with the original movement. But it is also important to note that by the end of the nineteenth century, the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> category was already expanded to encompass Western learning, including contemporary political history, institutions, commerce, science, military tactics, and even Christianity. Thus, it was the idea of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> that provided late Qing Confucians with the much-needed justification to seek knowledge of practical relevance to China from the West. Hence, the famous formula, “Chinese learning for the fundamentals and Western learning for practical use.” It was rather natural for Western learning, especially science and technology, to be thus accommodated in Confucianism, for the Confucian idea of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i>, being particularly attentive to all kinds of practical problems, always emphasized the importance of technical expertise and its innovation.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Another new departure of Confucianism was the rise of the so-called New Text school, which began quietly with Zhuang Cunyu <span>莊</span><span>存</span><span>與</span> (1719&ndash;1788), an obscure scholar in the heyday of mainstream classical scholarship. Mid-Qing classicists often referred to their philological approach to classical texts as Han learning on the assumption that they generally followed the model of textual exegesis of the Han dynasty. However, in the course of his research, Zhuang discovered that there was an early Han exegetical tradition that had been completely ignored by classical philologists of his day. This was the Gongyang school (later known as the New Text school), with Dong Zhongshu <span>董</span><span>仲</span><span>舒</span> (ca. 179&ndash;ca. 104 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>) as its most outstanding representative. According to this tradition, Confucius was a prophet who wrote the <i class="calibre9">Chunqiu</i> (Spring and Autumn Annals) to convey his ideas about how a future king of a unified China should establish his institutions. But these ideas were not explicitly expressed in writing. Instead, they were transmitted orally from generation to generation by the followers of the prophet. According to this view, therefore, the <i class="calibre9">Spring and Autumn Annals</i> is not a simple historical text to be read literally. On the contrary, it is a repository of the prophet’s “esoteric words and great principles” whose meanings can only be grasped by way of interpretation beyond the literal sense of the text.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1035" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Such being the case, the New Text tradition had remained virtually untouched by mainstream Confucians until Zhuang Cunyu appeared on the scene, for the simple reason that philology was wholly inadequate to the task. Viewed in this way, Zhuang’s excursion in New Text studies may well be understood as an isolated anomaly in the practice of the so-called Han Learning. As Ruan Yuan <span>阮</span><span>元</span> (1764&ndash;1849), the nineteenth-century patron saint of Han Learning, rightly observed, Zhuang’s work remained obscure during his lifetime because his approach was completely out of step with mainstream classical scholarship. Thus, it would take about half a century for the significance of his studies on the Gongyang tradition to be generally recognized due, first, to the efforts of Liu Fenglu <span>劉</span><span>逢</span><span>祿</span> (1776&ndash;1829), his grandson, and Song Xiangfeng <span>宋</span><span>翔</span><span>風</span> (1776&ndash;1860), his grandnephew, and then through the influential writings of Gong Zizhen and Wei Yuan.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In more general terms, it may be suggested that nineteenth-century Confucianism took two turns, a practical turn in the revival of the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> impulse and an interpretive turn in the rediscovery of the Gongyang tradition. We have seen that the former was a direct response to the ever-deepening political and social crisis. Was it also the case that Zhuang Cunyu’s turn to the New Text school of Dong Zhongshu was, as his biographer Gong Zizhen said, motivated by his “secret desire to improve the world”? Not exactly. Evidence rather suggests that it began, first and foremost, as an internal revolt against mainstream classical scholarship. By the middle of the eighteenth century, the majority of philologically trained classicists tended to be obsessed with technical details in their normal research. More often than not they failed to rise from the grasp of the minute and disconnected from the grasp of the whole. But his shreds-and-patches approach could not possibly meet the spiritual needs of those Confucians who were primarily interested in discovering broad visions in classical and historical texts. As a result, a subtle methodological shift occurred: interpretation began to be emphasized as equally important as, if not more important than, philological explication. In his search for the “great principles” in the <i class="calibre9">Spring and Autumn Annals</i>, Zhuang Cunyu was undoubtedly one of the earliest harbingers who set the interpretive turn in motion. From a purely methodological point of view, he may well be classed with Zhang Xuecheng and Dai Zhen, even though their pursuits in scholarship were worlds apart from one another. Interpretation was not only central to Zhang’s quest for meanings in history; Dai was also more interpretive than philological in his attempt to reconstruct a new Confucian philosophy, for which he was severely criticized by many fellow philologists.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-993" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In spite of their separate origins, the two new developments of Confucianism eventually converged in the middle of the nineteenth century to form the powerful movement of reformism. On the one hand, New Text Confucians such as Gong Zizhen and Wei Yuan pushed for practical changes by expanding the notion of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> beyond its traditional limits. On the other hand, <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> scholars unconnected to the Gongyang tradition such as Bao Shichen <span>包</span><span>世</span><span>臣</span> (1775&ndash;1855) also advocated fundamental institutional reforms. However, it was Kang Youwei who most successfully combined both trends, the interpretive and the practical, into one well-integrated academy in Canton. At the same time, he began to develop his most radical interpretation of the New Text Confucianism. Thus, in a study of the so-called forged classics, <i class="calibre9">Xinxue weijing kao</i> <span>新</span><span>學</span><span>偽</span><span>經</span><span>考</span> (A study of the “New Text” forgeries [Guangzhou: 1891]), he made a heroic attempt to prove that many of the Confucian texts philologically explicated by mainstream Qing classicists were actually forged by what he called the Old Text school under the leadership of Liu Xin <span>劉</span><span>歆</span> (d. 22 <small class="calibre7">C.E.</small>) for the support of the New Dynasty of Wang Mang <span>王</span><span>莽</span> (9&ndash;23 <small class="calibre7">C.E</small>.). He claimed that the true Confucian teachings can only be found in the sage’s own writings, principally the <i class="calibre9">Spring and Autumn Annals</i>, for even the <i class="calibre9">Lunyu</i> (Analects) suffered falsifications in the hands of Liu Xin and his colleagues. In another major work, <i class="calibre9">Kongzi gaizhi kao</i> <span>孔</span><span>子</span><span>改</span><span>制</span><span>考</span> (A study of Confucius as a reformer [Shanghai: Shanghai shudian, 1992: (1896)]), he further presented Confucius as a prophet-reformer who laid down plans for institutional reforms not only for his own age but for future generations as well. Following the Gongyang interpretation, he believed that Confucius’s <i class="calibre9">Spring and Autumn Annals</i> contains a theory of three-stage progress in human history, namely, Disorder, Relative Peace, and Universal Peace. In his view, therefore, the primary and real duty of every Confucian must by definition consist in carrying out reforms and initiating changes necessary for his own time as originally envisioned by Confucius. Thus, the convergence of the practical turn and the interpretive turn finally culminated in Kang’s version of Confucian reformism. However, as Kang had incorporated too many Western ideas and values into his political philosophy, he also brought Qing Confucianism to an end.</span></div>

<div class="chaptitle"><span class="calibre4"><a href="#calibre_link-316" id="calibre_link-2155" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 calibre4 pcalibre1"><span class="calibre11">6. The Two Worlds of <i class="calibre5">Honglou meng</i> (Dream of the Red Chamber)</span></a></span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1075" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">T</span>wo worlds in sharp contrast to each other are created by Cao Xueqin <span>曹</span><span>雪</span><span>芹</span> (1716?&ndash;1763) in his novel <i class="calibre9">Honglou meng</i> <span>紅</span><span>樓</span><span>夢</span> (Dream of the Red Chamber), two worlds which, for the sake for distinction, I shall call the “Utopian world” and the “world of reality.” These two worlds, as embodied in the novel, are the world of Daguanyuan <span>大</span><span>觀</span><span>園</span><sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-317" id="calibre_link-331" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> and the world that existed outside it. The difference between these two worlds is indicated by a variety of opposing symbols, such as “purity” and “impurity,” “love” and “lust,” “falsity” and “truth,” and the two sides of the Precious Mirror of Romance. Throughout the book, mention of these two worlds constitutes a most important clue which, if grasped intelligently, will enable us to understand the significance that lies behind the author’s creative intentions.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1017" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>These two worlds are so vividly portrayed and so sharply contrasted that all readers of the novel must, in one way or another, to a greater or lesser degree, be sensitive to their existence. In the past, however, for a long time the nature of “Redology” (<i class="calibre9">hongxue</i> <span>紅</span><span>學</span>)<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-318" id="calibre_link-332" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> was such that its chief efforts were devoted to research on the historical aspect of the novel. Our “Redologists,” being mostly historians or adherents to the historical method, had naturally focused their attention on the world of reality that the novel described, so much so that the other world in the novel&mdash;the ideal world, the castle in the air that the author had “labored ten years to create”&mdash;was utterly neglected. In fact, these scholars’ chief concern had been to demolish this castle in the air and restore it to the bricks and stones that belonged to the world of reality. Under the influence of the “autobiographical approach,” restoration efforts went even further, with a shifting of emphasis from the world of reality in the novel to the world of reality in which the author once lived. In fact, what has been called for half a century Redology, or <i class="calibre9">Honglou meng</i> scholarship, was none other than Cao Xueqin scholarship, or the study of the man Cao Xueqin and his family history. This substitution of Cao Xueqin scholarship for <i class="calibre9">Honglou meng</i> scholarship necessarily involved certain sacrifices, one of the greatest of which, as I see it, is the obscuring of the line of division between the two worlds of the novel. The climax of historical research came during the years 1961 to 1963 when scholars in mainland China conducted an enthusiastic search for the “whereabouts of Daguanyuan inside the capital.” By this, people are given the distinct impression that Cao Xueqin’s garden exists in the world of reality and is part of it. The ideal world in the book is blanked out and, if one may borrow the words of the author, “It is a world wiped clean; only a sheet of white remains!”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Still, it would be unfair to say that during the past few decades no particular notice has been paid to the portraiture of the ideal world in the novel. As early as 1953 or 1954, Yu Pingbo had emphasized the idealistic element of Daguanyuan and observed that, judging from the level of vision on which it was imagined, the garden could well be a creation out of nowhere. He quoted Jia Yuanchun’s words from chapter 18, “Now all beautiful features of Heaven and Earth are assembled,” to illustrate that Daguanyuan was nothing but a paradisiacal mirage conjured up by the author’s pen. In the history of Redology, the point that he made had the significance of what Thomas S. Kuhn called a “paradigm,”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-319" id="calibre_link-333" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> and it is certainly lamentable that circumstances had forbidden him to give full assertion to this revolutionary viewpoint. In 1972, the first piece of writing appeared devoting a full discussion to the ideal world in the novel, a paper entitled “On Daguanyuan,” written by Stephen C. Soong. It argued that the garden definitely did not exist in the real world, that it was in truth an unreal creation born of the author’s imagination to suit his creative intentions. Soong even went as far as to say:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Daguanyuan is a garden that isolates the girls from the outside world, whereby it is hoped that the girls would lead carefree and leisurely lives and avoid being polluted by the filthy influences of the other sex. It would be best if the girls could preserve their youth forever, and not marry away. In this sense, Daguanyuan can be said to be a protective fortress for the girls which exists only in the ideal realm but has no foundation in reality.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-320" id="calibre_link-334" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>This statement, with its unpretentious and apt observation, will be the starting point of my discussion on the two worlds of <i class="calibre9">The Dream of the Red Chamber</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1415" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>To say that Daguanyuan was an ideal world created out of Cao Xueqin’s imagination automatically brings up an important question: If Daguanyuan was a “fairyland” where “no mortal is allowed to tread,” then what would be the position of the “Land of Illusion” (<i class="calibre9">taixu huanjing</i> <span>太</span><span>虛</span><span>幻</span><span>境</span>) mentioned in chapter 5 in relation to the whole book? Certainly we can call this Land of Illusion a dream within a dream and an illusion among illusions, but having established this, will we not be obliged to follow up by saying that in the novel there are three worlds altogether? On this point, the commentator Zhiyan Zhai <span>脂</span><span>硯</span><span>齋</span><sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-321" id="calibre_link-335" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup> (Rouge Ink stone) made the following observation: “Daguanyuan is the Land of Illusion for Baoyu and the twelve golden maidens&mdash;how can this fact be treated casually?”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-322" id="calibre_link-336" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> As Zhiyan Zhai saw it, Daguanyuan was the shadow of the Land of Illusion projected onto the world of man, and originally, these two worlds were one and the same and their images fitted each other exactly. There being no doubt that Zhiyan Zhai, incognito though he (or she) is, was intimately acquainted with the author and his creative intentions, we should feel safe to count his commentaries as the strongest side evidence if, at the same time, sufficient internal evidence is found in the novel itself. On this point, the novel does supply the following direct evidence: In chapter 5, Baoyu follows Qin Keqing “to a place where vermilion railings and white stones, green trees and clear streams came into sight, unvisited by man and unpolluted by dust. In his dream, Baoyu was enraptured and thought, ‘This place is really interesting. I am willing to spend the rest of my life here, even if I have to forsake my family for it.’ ” The place described here was in fact the Daguanyuan that appeared later on in the novel, for in chapter 17, the same line, “vermilion railings and white stones, green trees and clear streams” was magnified into a description of the landscape near Xinfang Yuan <span>沁</span><span>芳</span><span>園</span> before which Jia Zheng and Baoyu passed on their tour of the garden. Also, in chapter 33, the novel tells us that “having moved into the garden, Baoyu felt completely satisfied, and could find nothing more to be unhappy about.” A close comparison between the passages that come before and after these lines will enable us to see the kind of relationship that existed between the Land of Illusion and Daguanyuan.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If this piece of evidence seems a little oblique, a more straightforward and explicit one can be quoted from chapter 17, which tells us how, departing from Hengwu Yuan <span>蘅</span><span>蕪</span><span>苑</span>, Jia Zheng, Baoyu, and others came before a jade-stone plaque.</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2480" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Here Jia Zheng raised the question, “What words should we inscribe here?” The crowd said, “Only Penglai, Land of Fairies, seems fitting,” but Jia Zheng shook his head and said nothing. At the sight of this place, Baoyu was suddenly reminded of something, and searching his memory, it seemed to him that he had seen this place somewhere before, and yet he could not remember on what day or month or year. Jia Zheng then told Baoyu to suggest a title, but Baoyu, with his heart set on recapturing that fleeting scene, could not gather his thoughts to perform this assignment.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Then Jia Zheng specially added the remark:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>“This place is strategic, so you had better come up with a good one.”</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Now where actually had Baoyu seen this jade-stone plaque before? Maybe he could not recall it himself, but readers will remember that in chapter 5, while touring the Land of Illusion, Baoyu had “followed the fairy maiden to a place where they saw a stone plaque, placed sideways, on which were written the words ‘Land of Illusion.’ ” Was not this the very place Baoyu was trying to dig up in his memory? As Jia Zheng had emphatically said, “This place is strategic.” It certainly is, for what place in the novel can be more important than the Land of Illusion? The same jade-stone plaque was later named “Precious Mirror of the Heavenly Fairies” by Baoyu, and Liu Laolao, mistaking the name for “Precious Temple of the Jade Emperor,” kowtowed enthusiastically to it. Thus, by alternately using the names “Penglai, Land of Fairies,” “Precious Mirror of the Heavenly Fairies,” and “Precious Temple of the Jade Emperor,” the author was reminding us time and again that Daguanyuan does not exist on earth, but is in heaven, and that it is not an aspect of reality, but an aspect of the ideal. To put it more precisely, Daguanyuan and the Land of Illusion are indeed one and the same.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2481" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Now that we see that Daguanyuan was actually no less than the Land of Illusion for Baoyu and his female companions, it becomes understandable why the plan for building it must have a pretext as weighty as the home-visit of Yuanchun, the Royal Concubine. One comment in chapter 16 of the Zhiyan Zhai edition says: “Daguanyuan was built to fit the occasion of the home-visit&mdash;this key factor reveals the purpose of the author’s grand design.” In addition to this significant design, an interesting piece of narrative in the opening pages of chapter 17 tells us that after the garden was completed, Jia Zhen offered to lead Jia Zheng on a tour of it to see whether changes should be made anywhere, adding that Jia She had already made his tour&mdash;which seemed to imply that Jia She was the first man to have gone into the garden. This was purposely misleading, however, for later on it was said, “Because Qin Zhong occupied Baoyu’s thoughts, causing him unending grief, Grandma Jia gave orders for Baoyu to be taken into the garden so that he could amuse himself there.” Right after this, we are told that Baoyu stumbled upon Jia Zheng unawares and was ordered to follow him back into the garden to write inscriptions for the tablets. The latter part of this narrative implies at least two things: first, that Baoyu was the very first person to enter Daguanyuan to admire the scenery&mdash;he had been there more than once before Jia Zheng, Jia She, and others went in to examine the completed works; and second, since Daguanyuan had the significance of a Utopia or a Pure Land for Baoyu and the girls, it is imperative that they themselves, rather than anyone else, should perform the task of naming the various pieces of architecture there. The fairyland where “no mortal is allowed to tread” would not permit of pollution by outsiders. Thus, Zhiyan Zhai in his summing-up comment for chapter 17 said: “Baoyu is the beauty of all beauties, and for this reason, he must take up the task of inscribing the tablets in Daguanyuan.” And another comment of his also said: “The accidental nature of the encounter is precisely what intrigues us. If Baoyu was specially summoned to inscribe the tablets, the passage would lose all the literary merits that it now has.” At such points, these commentaries help us penetrate the author’s intentions, thus allowing us to understand the full meaning of many of his statements. And there is seldom an idle word in the <i class="calibre9">Red Chamber</i> narrative.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>We all know that Baoyu did not compose inscriptions for all the tablets in Daguanyuan that day. As a matter of fact, there were so many pieces of architecture in Daguanyuan that Baoyu could not possibly have coined names for them all. Who else had contributed to this task? The answer came in chapter 76, when Daiyu and Shi Xiangyun were spending the Mid-Autumn Festival evening together, admiring the moon and writing poetry. Shi Xiangyun started praising the names “Tubitang” <span>凸</span><span>碧</span><span>堂</span> (Convex Blue Hall) and “Aojingguan” <span>凹</span><span>晶</span><span>館</span> (Concave Crystal House) as being fresh and unconventional, whereupon Daiyu said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>To tell you the truth, these names were coined by me. You remember that year when Baoyu was put to the test&mdash;he thought up names for several places, some were used, some were changed, but there were places he didn’t cover. Afterwards all of us worked together and fixed up names for those places that still didn’t have any. We noted the source of those names as well as the location of each place, and handed them in together for Elder Sister to see; then she brought the list out for Uncle to have a look. To our surprise, Uncle liked our suggestions, and even said, “If I only knew, I would have asked the girls to do it together that day. It would have been such fun.” So, every one of the names suggested by me was adopted, without so much as changing one single character.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>So finally, in this passage, we are given to know whatever was left unsaid previously about that day’s inscription of tablets in Daguanyuan. The truth comes out that, apart from Baoyu, it was the girls, especially Daiyu, who performed the task of naming the various spots in the garden. Once again we are impressed by the author’s grand design, for there is a span of sixty chapters between the previous mention of the episode in chapter 17 and this passage from chapter 76, which for the author meant nearly the end of his portion of the novel. Yet despite this long interval, he was able to link the beginning and end of the narrative together meaningfully.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1018" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Daguanyuan, being the embodiment of the ideal world, was an unreal world that the author had lavished great imagination to create. To Baoyu, the protagonist of the book, it was the only world that had any significance. Baoyu and the girls around him practically treated the world outside Daguanyuan as nonexistent, or, if they took note of it at all, saw in it only negative meaning, for this outside world stands for squalor and degradation. Most readers are also inclined to neglect this outside world of reality and instead fix their gaze on the attractions of the Utopian garden. But Cao Xueqin himself was not guilty of this negligence, for he had attached equal importance and devoted an equal amount of care to the portrayal of the unclean and degraded world of reality. It becomes obvious, therefore, that a difference in viewpoint separates the author, the protagonist, and the reader. It is the inability to settle this important question of viewpoint that impedes the establishment of the “autobiographical approach,” which wishfully lumps Baoyu and the author together as one person.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Successful as he was in creating a Pure Land that existed in the realm of the ideal, Cao Xueqin was deeply aware of the impossibility of disconnecting this Pure Land from the filthy world of reality. Not only is such disconnection impossible, but actually, the two worlds are forever closely integrated, and any attempt to view them as separate entities and to interpret each of them in isolation must result in failure to grasp the novel’s internal coherence. To understand this, it is necessary for us to examine the realistic foundations of Daguanyuan.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The construction of Daguanyuan is clearly related in chapter 16. The site</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>begins on the east side, rising from the garden of the East Mansion, and extends to the north, covering a distance that, if exactly measured, amounts to three and a half <i class="calibre9">li</i>.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>This is followed by a more detailed account:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Orders were first given to the workmen to pull down the walls and buildings in the Ning Mansion’s Huifang Yuan <span>會</span><span>芳</span><span>園</span> so that it can open straight into the east court of the Rong Mansion…. As there is already running water coming into Huifang Yuan from under the north corner of the wall, there is no need to look elsewhere for water. Not enough rocks and plants can be taken from the spot for the present purpose, but bamboos, trees, rocks, pavilions, and even railings can be borrowed from the old garden of the Rong Mansion, where Jia She lived.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>It is a pity that so far, scholars influenced by the “autobiographical approach” have not probed further into these lines, which are pregnant with meaning.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-323" id="calibre_link-337" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> We have already seen that, as the author and critics have repeatedly pointed out, the birth of Daguanyuan was an event of first importance in the novel. Judging from this, the author’s detailed account of the realistic origin of the garden cannot be without motivation. Of course, all our doubts would be cleared if the adherents of the autobiographical approach could establish that Daguanyuan was erected from the old residence of the Cao family, but, this being impossible, we have to look for explanations elsewhere.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1344" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>According to the above-quoted passage, the site of Daguanyuan was a combination of the sites of two older gardens&mdash;the Ning Mansion’s Huifang Yuan and the old garden of the Rong Mansion, where Jia She lived. In chapter 17, with reference to the text, “On it mosses grew in patches, and creepers peeped out from the shadows,” Zhiyan Zhai made the following comment: “(Daguanyuan) being reconstructed from the two older gardens, it is essential to describe it in such a way&mdash;this description reveals an extremely fine perception.” From this we can see that both author and critic, explicitly or implicitly, took pains to remind the reader that important information was concealed in these two older gardens. But what exactly was concealed? An answer to this must begin with an examination of the character Jia She, who was one of the dirtiest people in the novel. Jia She’s character was not presented with the restraint that the author usually observed when exposing the sins of the older generation, a restraint we can perhaps best understand by remembering the saying, “One should cover up for one’s seniors.” Conversely, the ugly deeds given full treatment in the book are largely attributed to the likes of Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and Xue Pan, who belonged to the same generation as Baoyu&mdash;a point that certainly carried “autobiographical” significance.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-324" id="calibre_link-338" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> Nevertheless, the usual restraint on the part of the author did not spare Jia She his lashings. The entirety of chapter 46 was devoted to an account, plus condemnation, of his outrageous efforts to make the maid Yuanyang his concubine. The author opined through the mouth of Xiren: “Really&mdash;we shouldn’t be saying this&mdash;but this Elder Master is a real sex maniac. He just wouldn’t keep his hands off anyone with a halfway decent face.” We suspect, too, that the abundant descriptions of adulterous conduct on the part of Jia Lian were meant to reflect the old proverb “Like father, like son.” What this adds up to is that the garden Jia She once inhabited, and the bamboo, trees, rocks and stones, as well as the pavilions, groves, and railings that had been associated with his presence, must likewise be contaminated.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1340" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>An examination of the garden of the East Mansion reveals even more sordid secrets. As Liu Xianglian’s famous remark goes, “Apart from these two stone lions, I’m afraid nothing in your East Mansion is clean&mdash;nothing, not even your cats and dogs.” Still, this is a general statement and the true character of this place called Huifang Yuan requires further analysis. In the chapters preceding chapter 16, before Daguanyuan came into being, Huifang Yuan was, in fact, the stage on which many of the novel’s important episodes had been enacted. Parts of this garden still identifiable today include Tianxiang Lou <span>天</span><span>香</span><span>樓</span>, Ningxi Xuan <span>凝</span><span>曦</span><span>軒</span>, Dengxian Ge <span>登</span><span>仙</span><span>閣</span>, etc. Of these, Tianxiang Lou was, of course, well known for being a den of iniquity, for chapter 13 was originally entitled, “The Adulterous Qin Keqing Met Her Death in Tianxiang Lou” (Qin Keqing sifeng Longjinwei, Wang Xifeng xieli Ningguofu). Nor did the other two places carry cleaner reputations; Ningxi Xuan was the place where the gentlemen, young and old, gathered for drinking and merrymaking, a place where they went “to do Heaven-knows-what,” in Fengjie’s words. What they did we can easily imagine if we look up chapter 75,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-325" id="calibre_link-339" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> where it tells us that what kept Jia Zhen and others at Tianxiang Lou were the gambling, the dirty talk, and the young boys who were there to satisfy the men’s lustful pleasures. As for Dengxian Ge, it was the place where Qin Keqing’s and the maid Ruizhu’s coffins were temporarily placed after the two had killed themselves, the one by hanging and the other by striking her head against a pillar. And chapter 11 gives us one more scandal about Huifang Yuan&mdash;“On seeing Fengjie, Jia Rui lusted after her.” It was, in fact, in that garden that the two had first encountered each other.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>We can now draw the conclusion that the old garden where Jia She had lived and Huifang Yuan of the East Mansion were in reality two of the dirtiest places in the world, and yet they formed the site and foundation on which Daguanyuan was erected&mdash;that ideal world and cleanest of all human abodes. Can such an arrangement be accidental? Even the cleanest element in Daguanyuan&mdash;the water&mdash;had to be obtained from the aqueducts of Huifang Yuan. On this point, Zhiyan Zhai made the following comment: “Water is the feature that matters most in the garden; hence, it must be given explicit treatment in the writing.” Thus, we become aware of the author’s desire to inform us at all times that the ideal world in the novel was actually erected on the foundation of a real world that harbored the greatest vice. He wanted us to bear in mind that in fact the greatest purity was born of the greatest impurity. If the novel were completed by Cao Xueqin, or if a complete version were handed down to us intact, we would certainly be told that the ultimate fate of that great purity is to return to impurity. “She wanted to be clean, but clean she never was; she said her life was a Void, but was it really so?” These two lines from the prophetic chapter 5 embody not only Miaoyu’s fate, but also the fate of all of Daguanyuan, for among the inhabitants of Daguanyuan, was not Miaoyu the one who was most addicted to cleanliness? On the one hand, Cao Xueqin had devoted wholehearted efforts to the creation of an ideal world&mdash;a world he wished could last forever in the realm of man. On the other hand, his pen had mercilessly carved out a world of reality, the exact foil to that ideal world. All the forces of this world of reality will continuously batter at the ideal world until the latter is completely destroyed. The two worlds of <i class="calibre9">The Dream of the Red Chamber</i> are interwoven in an inseparable relationship. Moreover, the inner dynamics of this relationship push the novel toward a definite direction. It is when this dynamic relationship develops to its utmost that the tragic consciousness of the novel will rise to its greatest height.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The next part of this essay goes a step further to substantiate our two-world theory with an examination of how the people of Daguanyuan themselves looked upon the contrast between squalor and cleanliness. Especially important here are Daiyu’s thoughts as revealed in the famous flower-burial episode, a deeply significant scene that occurs in chapter 23, when Baoyu and his female companions were just starting their ideal life in Daguanyuan. The story tells us:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1172" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It was in the middle of the Third Month. That day, after the morning meal, Baoyu took his copy of the <i class="calibre9">Huizhen ji</i> <span>會</span><span>真</span><span>記</span> to the bridge at Xinfang Gate <span>沁</span><span>芳</span><span>閘</span> and sat down on a stone under the peach blossoms. He opened his book and read it carefully from the beginning. As he came to a place where it told of “fallen blossoms forming a pattern,” a wind swept past, and tore down more than half of the flowers from the peach tree, covering his book as well as the ground with petals. He wanted to shake them off, but fearing they might be trampled upon, he held the petals and went to the edge of the pond, and shook them into the water; the petals, floating on the surface, drifted away out of Xinfang Gate. Going back to the original spot, he saw that there were still a lot of peach blossoms scattered on the ground. Just when he was hesitating, he heard somebody speak behind him, “What are you doing here?” Turning around, he saw it was Lin Daiyu, carrying a flower-hoe on her shoulder, from which was suspended a chiffon sack, and holding a flower-broom in her hand. Baoyu laughed and said: “Good, good, come and sweep up these flowers and dump them on the water, will you? I’ve just dumped quite a few over there.” Lin Daiyu answered: “It isn’t good to leave them on the water. Look, the water here is clean, but once it flows out, it gets mixed up with the dirty and stinking water that people pour from their homes, and the flowers would still be spoilt. In that corner, I have a tomb for flowers. Let’s sweep these up and put them in this silk bag, and cover it up with soil. As the days pass, they will simply dissolve in the soil. Isn’t that much cleaner?”</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Way back in the last years of the Qing dynasty, Peking opera had dramatized this well-known scene, and the famous actors, Mei Lanfang and Ouyang Youqian, had made it popular with their adaptations in the early years of the Republic. Because public interest had converged on Baoyu and Daiyu’s romance, especially the sentimentalism of “Over the flower tomb, Daiyu shed tears for the fallen petals” in chapter 27, while Redologists too often concentrated on the source of the term “flower burial,”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-326" id="calibre_link-340" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> no one has yet given serious thought to the implications behind Daiyu’s act of burying flowers.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Let me state here that Daiyu’s flower-burial episode is the author’s first explicit indication of the difference that lies between the two worlds in the novel. I say first because the episode is the first incident that occurred after Baoyu and his companions had moved into Daguanyuan. Daiyu’s thoughts were obvious enough&mdash;everything in Daguanyuan was clean while everything outside was dirty and smelt of decay, so that burying the fallen blossoms inside the garden and letting them dissolve in the soil would enable them to remain clean forever. Here, of course, the flowers symbolize the female inhabitants of the garden. Daiyu’s flower-burying poem manifests this by saying:</span></div>
<div class="hanging"><span><a id="calibre_link-1342" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Better sweet remains in silken purse be saved</span></div>
<div class="hanging1"><span>And cupp’d in a mound of earth so pure.</span></div>
<div class="hanging1"><span>That which arrived clean, clean it must go,</span></div>
<div class="hanging1"><span>Lest in muddy waters it be soiled.</span></div>
<div class="noindent1"><span>A particular flower was claimed by each young lady during the Feast of the Flowers described in chapter 63, and Fengjie exclaimed in chapter 42, “Isn’t that the Flower Fairy in the garden!” Likewise, the chapter 78 story of Jingwen’s transformation into a flower fairy after she died must be interpreted in the same light. Following this flower symbolism, the only way for the inhabitants of Daguanyuan to preserve their cleanliness and chastity would be to anchor themselves permanently in the ideal realm and not venture beyond it. I have said previously that Baoyu and the girls practically viewed the outside world as nonexistent, but this is only to point out how ardently these people wished that their ideal world could last forever and how they longed for cleanliness of the soul; it does not imply that they were entirely ignorant of realities outside the garden. As the author said, the girls in Daguanyuan were “innocent and naive,” but not childish or stupid. On the one hand, they distinguished sharply between the two different worlds, and on the other, they were well aware of the great harm the world of reality could wreak on the ideal world. These two levels of significance are ingeniously conveyed to us through the use of concrete imagery in the flower-burial episode.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The novel sometimes also depicts the hostility of the outside world in explicit and penetrating language. In chapter 49, when the wonderful life in Daguanyuan was just beginning to unfold with the arrival of such important persons as Xue Baochai, Xing Xiuyan, Li Wen, Li Qi, etc., Shi Xiangyun gave Baochai this frank warning: “You can play and laugh and eat as much as you want to in front of Grandmother or when you’re in the garden. When you’re in Auntie’s chamber, and Auntie happens to be in, you can chat with her and stay a while. But when Auntie is not there, don’t you go in. All of those people in that house are bad&mdash;they want to harm us.” On hearing this, Baochai laughed and said, “Talk of you being naive&mdash;well, you’re not entirely naive; but though you’re not naive, your mouth is far too honest.” Here, Shi Xiangyun was being quite outspoken, and even betrayed a mistrust for Madam Wang. It seemed that when the residents of Daguanyuan ventured outside their Utopia, the only spot they could tread safely was in the presence of Grandma Jia, while everyone else set out to harm them. Grandma Jia was accepted as a kindred spirit chiefly because of her former status as one of the twelve maidens of Zhenxia Ge <span>枕</span><span>霞</span><span>閣</span> and thus, in the eyes of the Daguanyuan crowd, could be accepted as “one of us.” This strong in-group feeling&mdash;“Us” versus “Them”&mdash;that bound the inhabitants of Daguanyuan so closely together must have risen from their awareness of the vast differences between the two worlds.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1341" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>However, in the in-group society of Daguanyuan, not everyone was equal, for the ideal world operates according to a distinct order of its own. Wang Anshi had observed that in the Peach Blossom Spring, the first Utopia ever created in Chinese literature, “there were neither king nor subject, only fathers and sons,” meaning that in the Peach Blossom Spring, though no political order existed, an ethical order did prevail. In Daguanyuan, order was established chiefly on the principle of “love,” and quite logically, the novel concludes with The Celestial Roster of Lovers. However, with this Roster now inaccessible to us, we have no means of finding out exactly what kind of order the author had in mind to establish in his ideal world; all we can say is that apart from “love,” other factors also affect the ranking on the Roster. We should therefore not forget to take into account such attributes as beauty, talent, behavior, and even status. Here I shall only mention one vital clue that scholars have more or less neglected&mdash;the question of Baoyu’s relationship with the girls. On this point, the 1760 version of the novel gives an important comment by Zhiyan Zhai in chapter 46: “All girls that appear in this Record of Love must register with Brother Stone (Baoyu) first.” The term “love” here is the same as that in the Roster of Love. Judging from this, it seems certain that each character’s position on the Celestial Roster must be greatly affected by the degree of intimacy she shared with Baoyu, and a study of how each person registered with Brother Stone becomes essential to our understanding of Daguanyuan’s inner structure.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2482" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This brings us to the question of architectural design in the garden, which I think is highly relevant to the novel’s internal structure and which Stephen C. Soong has, quite correctly, from the point of view of literary criticism, associated with the author’s method of characterization. True to the statement “A man’s house is an extension of himself,”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-327" id="calibre_link-341" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> the hero’s character is often revealed by the way his house is arranged. In his design of Daguanyuan’s setting, Cao Xueqin went even further than this, for he made use of the variations in size and fineness, as well as the distances between the buildings in the garden, to describe the order that prevailed in the ideal world. Some examples illustrating this can be quoted from chapter 17, which tells of how Baoyu made his rounds to inscribe the tablets for the various buildings in the garden. In this chapter, the narrative dwells emphatically on four places&mdash;Xiaoxiang Guan <span>瀟</span><span>湘</span><span>館</span>, Daoxang Cun <span>稻</span><span>香</span><span>村</span>, Hengwu Yuan <span>蘅</span><span>蕪</span><span>苑</span>, and Yihong Yuan <span>怡</span><span>紅</span><span>院</span>, in each case letting the reader in on certain symbolically significant information. As everyone who saw it had enthusiastically exclaimed, Xiaoxiang Guan was a “marvellous place,” and Baoyu gave it the title “Phoenix’s Abode,” signifying its importance as the first stop on the tour of the Imperial Concubine. In the words of Zhiyan Zhai, this “marvellous place” was “the only fitting residence for Daiyu.” Chapter 23 also reported Daiyu as saying to Baoyu, “As for myself, I prefer Xiaoxiang Guan,” at which Baoyu clapped his hands and said, laughing, “You feel exactly as I do, for I was about to ask you to pick this place, too. I’ll live in Yihong Yuan. We two will be close together, quiet and undisturbed.” This is a fine example of how distance and setting are utilized to reflect the special relationship that existed between Baoyu and Daiyu.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>When Jia Zheng asked Baoyu how he liked Daoxiang Cun, Baoyu immediately replied that it was “far inferior to the ‘Phoenix’s Abode,’ ” and then criticized it for its artificiality and lack of natural flavor, much to Jia Zheng’s displeasure. Later, Baoyu failed to produce a poem using Daoxiang Cun as subject matter, a task that Daiyu completed for him. All this shows that Li Wan, who was the occupant of Daoxiang Cun, stood quite low in Baoyu’s opinion, she being the only woman in Daguanyuan who had had a husband and he was, as we all know, one who held definite views toward married women. But it is fitting that Baoyu’s critical attitude should be limited to this oblique way of expression, for after all, Li Wan was his sister-in-law and had an excellent character. The point that is particularly interesting here is the distinction between “artificiality” and “naturalness.” It is indeed not without reason that Li Wan is placed next to last, just above Qin Keqing, in the “Main Register of the Twelve Golden Maidens of Jinling.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Jia Zheng’s remark on Hengwu Yuan was “What a boring place!”&mdash;again betraying the author’s deprecation, but delivered from the mouth of the father so that Baoyu’s opinion could be reserved. In this way, the author ingeniously avoided the problem, pointed out by Yu Pingbo, of having to state explicitly which girl&mdash;Daiyu or Baochai&mdash;was considered superior. Here Zhiyan Zhai gave a comment that is quite perceptive of the author’s intention: “This treatment makes the later story all the more colorful&mdash;before getting any praise, Hengwu Yuan is criticized first. Otherwise, the balance of power between Baochai and Daiyu is a really difficult subject to treat.” And, later in chapter 56, a remark from Tanchun&mdash;“What a pity that two big establishments like Hengwu Yuan and Yihong Yuan should produce nothing profitable!”&mdash;reveals almost casually that the two were rivals in size among the residences in Daguanyuan. Thus, we see clearly the “balance of power” between Baochai and Daiyu&mdash;for although Daiyu and Baoyu lived in close proximity, Baochai’s and Baoyu’s residences were equals in size.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1173" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Where architectural design was concerned, the significance of Yihong Yuan can be seen from three features: first, the fact that Baoyu wanted to give the place the name “Red Fragrance and Green Jade” for its double implication&mdash;a thought that was echoed later when he composed poetry on the order of Yuanchun; second, the fact that Yihong Yuan was the only house in Daguanyuan furnished with a full-size mirror&mdash;symbol of the Precious Mirror of Romance; and third, the fact that all the water in Daguanyuan “collects at this place and then flows out from under that wall.” Zhiyan Zhai was indeed right in saying, “Yihong Yuan was the confluence of all Daguanyuan&mdash;this represents a major theme of the book.” This is because the author is using the garden’s architectural design to show how Baoyu related with each of the girls, and through this, to offer an explanation for the inner structure of the ideal world. It is in this light that we should comprehend Zhiyan Zhai’s statement that everyone who appeared in the Record of Love must register with “Brother Stone” first. What is more, the fact that all the water, after collecting at Yihong Yuan, flowed outside from under the wall, exactly echoes what Daiyu said when she was burying the flowers&mdash;“The water here is clean, but once it flows out, it becomes dirty and stinks.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>So far, this essay has emphasized the concept that the two worlds in <i class="calibre9">The Dream of the Red Chamber</i> were a direct contrast between cleanliness and uncleanliness, and numerous examples have been quoted to support that argument. However, there is one concrete and empirical question that we still have to face&mdash;whether, after all, life in Daguanyuan was all that clean. It is imperative that we answer this question, for if the truth came out that Daguanyuan was actually just as dirty as the world of reality outside, then the point that we are forcing&mdash;that the two worlds are exact foils to each other&mdash;will fall short of solid proof.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To test this vital point in our argument, we can no longer adopt our hitherto method of proof by example, because there cannot be any evidence of what is nonexistent in Daguanyuan&mdash;namely, smut. What we can say is that, in principle, within the realm of Daguanyuan, Cao Xueqin wrote only about love and not lust. Rather, he had given the most vivid descriptions of the lasciviousness of the outside world so that it could serve as a sharp contrast to the life of rarefied emotions that was led by those who dwelt in the garden.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2483" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As every reader knows, Daguanyuan was basically a girls’ world, a world in which no male had ever lived, except Baoyu. Once we made sure that Baoyu led a clean life there, the chasteness of this ideal world would be initially guaranteed. In chapter 31, the author gave us an important clue to this question by telling us that when Baoyu asked Qingwen to bathe with him, Qingwen had laughed and said, “That time Bihen sent you off to your bath, you took fully two or three hours. Not knowing what you were up to, we didn’t dare go in. After you finished, I went in to take a look, and there were puddles of water around the legs of the bed, and even the mattress was dripping wet. Heaven knows how you washed yourself.” A lot seems to be implied in these words, for Qingwen was the maid who shared Baoyu’s room and looked after him at night, after Xiren had found favor with Madam Wang and, in order to appear proper, stayed aloof from him. If Baoyu did anything amiss, Qingwen would be the one most likely to blame, and she was finally banished for this reason. But in fact we know that nothing improper had ever occurred between Baoyu and Qingwen, and that was why, on her deathbed, Qingwen said she had “borne that (ill) name in vain.” To prove that the relationship between the two was a clean one, the author dragged in Deng Guniang, the most notorious whore in the book, to bear witness, and these were her words: “I’ve been in here for a while and listened carefully outside the window. There were only the two of you in the house. If there were anything fishy between you, surely you would have brought it up. Who would have guessed that you two had actually left each other alone? Well, this is not the first time in this world that people have been wrongly accused!” As a matter of fact, Deng Guniang’s testimony not only acquits Baoyu and Qingwen of the charges against them, but also brings out the truth about life in the garden. Even when Baoyu was left alone with Qingwen, his closest maid and the one most open to suspicion, the two had “left each other alone.” It is not hard to deduce from this the truth about everything else in the garden.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-328" id="calibre_link-342" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Finally, a thorny point that needs straightening out is the story, told in chapter 73, of how the maid nicknamed Sha Dajie (Sister Simpleton) by mistake picked up a purse on which an obscene picture was embroidered, something that appeared to be a downright contradiction of what we called the pure Utopian nature of Daguanyuan. Yet an analysis of this episode will show that it precisely confirms our theory of the novel’s two-world structure. This obscene purse must have been dropped by the maid Siqi and her younger cousin Pan You-an while they were philandering in the garden back in chapter 71. However, the narrative at the beginning of chapter 72 tells us that their lovemaking was interrupted by Yuanyang’s intrusion, which means that the pure world of Daguanyuan was on the verge of falling apart but had not yet entered the stage of complete collapse. Chapter 74 tells us that after Siqi had been pinned down as the suspect in adultery, she only bowed her head in silence but did not show any sign of fear or shame. This attitude can only be explained in terms of our analysis of “love” and “lust” (see <a href="#calibre_link-327" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">note 11</a>). Siqi must be deeply in love with her younger cousin. What the world looked upon as unforgivable “adultery” may not be a sin to the author, for he was known to have said, “Those who know love must lust all the more” and “When two people meet in love, they must end in lust.” Indeed, compared with what the outside world knew as “dirty Tang and stinking Han,” this kind of adultery was really nothing at all.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If we change our angle and think of the author as having intentionally presented this case as a scandalous affair, then we must acknowledge that this internal occurrence was an inevitable development in the course of the novel’s unfolding tragedy. We have already pointed out that in the end, the ideal world must be destroyed under the constant attacks launched by the forces of the world of reality. The appearance of the obscene purse in Daguanyuan was precisely the result of this invasion from without. But obviously one internal factor had permitted the invasion&mdash;the factor of “love” in the ideal world. “Love” in the ideal world was certainly pure and chaste, but, like the water in Daguanyuan, it was not static, and must eventually flow away into the outside world. In this sense, the tragic character of the novel was determined from the start. As we have maintained, a dynamic relationship existed between the two worlds of the author’s creation; we can now add to the statement and say that this dynamic relationship was rooted in the concept “when two people meet in love, they must end in lust.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1174" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>A number of signs indicate that from chapter 71 to chapter 80, Cao Xueqin was already actively planning the final annihilation of the ideal world of Daguanyuan. The most noticeable of these signs is found in chapter 76, when Daiyu and Shi Xiangyun amused themselves with poetry writing on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival. It turns out that the last line completed by Daiyu was “And the cold moon buries the souls of the flowers.” They were interrupted by Miaoyu, who came forward and said, “You had a good line in the one I just heard, only it sounded much too ominous. It may have something to do with one’s destiny, so I tell you: don’t go on.” As we know, flowers and plants are symbols for the female denizens of the garden, so if the “souls of the flowers were buried,” as Daiyu sang in her dirge, it must mean that Daguanyuan’s destiny was about to end. We see, therefore, that it was no coincidence that the obscene purse should make its appearance in the pure world at such a time. In fact, C. T. Hsia has compared the appearance of this purse to the appearance of the Serpent in the Garden of Eden that made Adam and Eve fall from Paradise into the world of Man, a comparison cited by Stephen Soong as having hit the nail right on the head.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-329" id="calibre_link-344" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It is generally accepted that the present 120-chapter novel came from the hands of more than one person. We have no way of knowing how Cao Xueqin, who had written the first eighty chapters, wanted to depict the fall of Daguanyuan, as the garden was superficially still enjoying “splendid prosperity” at the end of those eighty chapters. As far as we can guess, the author might make use of strong contrasts to emphasize a sad ending. Thus, while commenting on chapter 42, Zhiyan Zhai revealed, “Portions after [the eightieth chapter] are so disturbing that one finds it unbearable to finish reading them.” In the judgment of Zhou Ruchang, “In the second half of the novel, the original statuses and positions of all characters are to undergo a ‘complete reversal,’ ”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-330" id="calibre_link-345" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> a remark to which every scholar who studies the novel will assent. Perhaps the reversal would not be limited to the characters alone; following them, the ideal world of Daguanyuan, clean and unmolested though it was, could not but undergo a reversal, too&mdash;perhaps in the nature of a fall from prosperity to ruin. As for the people in the novel, reversal would not stop at the level of status and position&mdash;our two-world theory suggests that it must, to a certain extent, involve as well a reversal of cleanliness and uncleanliness.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2484" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>All the residents of Daguanyuan had a love for cleanliness, but it seems that those with the cleanest habits always attracted the most dirt, a fact best seen in chapters 40 and 41. These two chapters described how Grandma Jia led a group that included Liu Laolao to look at Tanchun’s house. The old lady was reported as saying laughingly: “Don’t let’s stay here. The girls don’t like people to come in to sit, they fear it might dirty the house.” After Tanchun, all smiles, pressed them to stay, the old lady laughed and added: “This third lassie of mine&mdash;she’s good, but the two jades (Baoyu and Daiyu) are nasty. In a while, when we’ve gotten drunk, we’ll pick on their places to make a row.” These lines paved the way for the next chapter entitled “Liu Laolao Lies Drunken in Yihong Yuan” (Jia Baoyu pincha Longcui An, Liu Laolao zuiwo Yihong Yuan), in which Baoyu, who hated most the filthiness of old married women, suffered Liu Laolao’s having taken the liberty of lying flat on his bed in Yihong Yuan and making the whole room stink with “her drunken smells.” Obviously, the author had done it on purpose&mdash;he had stained the ideal world’s beauty and cleanliness with ugliness and squalor from the world of reality. In the same chapter, Liu Laolao also had tea in Longcui An <span>櫳</span><span>翠</span><span>庵</span>&mdash;again highlighting the contrast to Miaoyu’s making a fetish out of being clean. This is why after chapter 80, the worst of fates befell Miaoyu. The Album of the Twelve Golden Maidens said of her:</span></div>
<div class="hanging"><span>She wanted to be clean, but clean she never was;</span></div>
<div class="hanging1"><span>She said her life was a Void, but was it really so?</span></div>
<div class="hanging1"><span>Alas, that this quality of gold and jade</span></div>
<div class="hanging1"><span>Should end up mired in mud!</span></div>
<div class="noindent1"><span>The song that Baoyu heard in his dream in chapter 5 also said, “She ended up dirt-laden and filthy, much against her own wishes, like a piece of white jade mired in the mud; no use for princes and knights to sigh for lack of chance to approach her”&mdash;concrete proof that after chapter 80, Miaoyu had completely fallen down in the world and met with a fate worse than death. She was the cleanest person in the ideal world of the novel, and yet, after that ideal world had broken up, she had dribbled into the dirtiest corner in the world of reality. This one example is enough to show how violent the contrast between the two worlds was as the author depicted them.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As cleanliness originally came from squalor, so in the end to squalor, it must ineluctably return. I feel this is the central significance of the tragedy of <i class="calibre9">The Dream of the Red Chamber</i>, and to Cao Xueqin, it must have been the greatest tragedy known to man.</span></div>

<div class="footnote"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-342" id="calibre_link-328" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"><span class="calibre14">12</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we must take a look at Cao Xueqin’s concept of “love” versus “lust.” As we have repeatedly pointed out, the two are at once sharply differentiated and mutually related in the two worlds of the <i class="calibre9">Honglou meng</i>. Not being an ascetic, Cao never regarded lust as an unqualified sin. Nor did he follow some kind of dualism and treat love and lust as distinctly separate entities. In <a href="#calibre_link-343" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">chapter 5</a> of the novel, he early proclaimed the doctrine that “to be attracted by feminine beauty is itself lust; even more so, to experience the feelings of love is to lust” and took his stand against the kind of hypocritical talk which held that “attraction for beauty” and “feelings of love” can exist independently of lust. In general, he believed that love can, and indeed must, embrace lust. When love leads to lust, then lust is essentially love, which is why love is also called “lust of the mind.” Lust, on the other hand, does not have the element of love in its makeup, and he castigated this “lust,” in the narrow sense of the word, as “skin-deep and promiscuous.”</span></div>
<div class="footnote-i"><span>Again, Cao Xueqin’s concept of <i class="calibre9">qing</i> <span>情</span> is not to be equated with the Platonic love of the West. Witness the phrase, “Those who know love must lust all the more,” as inscribed in the Register for Qin Keqing. To recognize this is to understand why the Fairy Disenchantment should instruct Baoyu secretly in the art of love and why, subsequently, Baoyu should want to reenact it with his maid Xiren. This is what the author meant to tell us: that Baoyu was a man fully capable of love and lust, but that what distinguished him was that in his case, lust was ever at the service of love. From this point of view, we need not insist that Baoyu was entirely innocent of carnal knowledge with the other maids in his apartment.</span></div>
<div class="footnote-i"><span>In sum, Cao Xueqin created in Baoyu a character in whom love and lust, purity and pollution, are equally represented. This is a character to mirror and bridge over the two worlds of his creation. The significance of the author’s including in <a href="#calibre_link-315" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">chapter 6</a> the incident of Baoyu’s sexual experiment with Xiren lies, to my way of thinking, in his desire to show that Baoyu’s leaving those pure maidens in Daguanyuan alone from then on was due to an unwillingness rather than an incapability. Were it not for this one explicit incident in <a href="#calibre_link-315" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">chapter 6</a>, there is no telling where the reader’s speculation on this score might lead him to!</span></div>

<div class="head1"><span class="calibre4">THE ORIGINS OF SUN’S THOUGHT</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1365" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">I</span>n an autobiographical sketch written in 1923, Sun Yat-sen <span>孫</span><span>逸</span><span>仙</span> said about his own thought: “Among the various revolutionary ideas I hold, some are adapted from traditional Chinese thought, others are appropriated from theories and practices developed in Europe, and still others are original insights grown out of my own critical reflections.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2173" id="calibre_link-2255" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> On the whole, I believe, this self-analysis can be easily borne out by a thorough investigation of his writings. That would lie beyond the scope of this study, however. The aim of the present chapter is rather a modest one. I shall confine my analysis to the first of the three component parts of Sun’s system of thought, namely, ideas adapted from the Chinese intellectual tradition.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1301" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the past few decades, various attempts have been made to identify the Confucian, Mohist, Daoist, and Legalist elements in Sun’s doctrine of the <i class="calibre9">sanmin zhuyi</i> <span>三</span><span>民</span><span>主</span><span>義</span> (Three Principles of the People).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2174" id="calibre_link-2256" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> However, my approach will be different. Instead of tracing individual ideas in Sun’s ideology of revolution to their original Chinese sources, I shall discuss his thought in relation to Chinese tradition holistically as well as in the context of Chinese intellectual history during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As Martin Wilbur observed, “Sun’s reformist prescriptions seem at all states of their development to reflect the ideas currently fashionable among the then-radical Chinese intellectuals; in short, he absorbed and popularized more than innovated.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2175" id="calibre_link-2257" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Like most educated Chinese youth of his day, Sun was exposed to Confucian classics early in life. By the age of twelve, he had studied the Four Books and the Five Classics, and at twenty, after eight years of English education in Hawaii and Hong Kong, he resumed studies of Chinese classics and history.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2176" id="calibre_link-2258" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup> His resumption of classical and historical studies was an event of great importance in his spiritual and intellectual growth. In 1886, when he was a student at the Canton Hospital Medical School, he is reported to have read Confucian classics and dynastic histories assiduously in his spare time. A complete set of the dynastic histories was found in his dormitory room. At first his schoolmates believed that he had purchased the set for decoration; to their surprise, they soon discovered that he was familiar with the contents of many of the histories. Only then did they begin to realize that his ambition went far beyond the pursuit of a successful medical career.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2177" id="calibre_link-2259" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>There can be little doubt that Sun’s early interest in Chinese classics and history was a genuine one because it remained with him until the end of his life. For example, in July 1924, only a few months before his death, he donated a set of the twenty-four histories and a set of the <i class="calibre9">Sibu beiyao</i> (Essential works of the four categories) to the library of the Whampoa Military Academy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2178" id="calibre_link-2260" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> Obviously, he believed that a basic knowledge of Chinese classics and history was necessary for the training of revolutionaries.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>This enduring interest in the Chinese tradition played an important part in the shaping of his vision of the future of China. It was probably this traditional strain in his thought that prevented him from falling into the trap of radical iconoclasm that characterized many Chinese revolutionary intellectuals, especially the generation that succeeded him. However, Sun’s interest in learning, whether Chinese or Western, was never purely academic. Rather it was, from the very beginning, deeply rooted in his central concern for changing China. Sun said in a short autobiography in Chinese that he wrote in 1896 at the request of the leading British sinologist H. A. Giles:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Since my early years, I had lofty ambitions, and by nature, I longed for the new and the strange. Therefore, most of what I studied was a broad, if impure, mixture of things. In Chinese studies, I loved only the literature of the Three Ages of Antiquity [i.e., Xia <span>夏</span>, Shang <span>商</span>, and Zhou <span>周</span>] and the two Han dynasties. In Western studies, I was most fascinated by the Way of Darwin. But I also read from time to time works on science and political affairs. As for religion, I worshiped Jesus, and as for men, I admire King Tang <span>湯</span> and King Wu <span>武</span>, and America’s George Washington.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2179" id="calibre_link-2261" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1240" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>A close analysis of this passage reveals that Sun’s pursuit of learning was oriented toward change or revolution. First, the fact that of all the sages and worthies in Chinese history he chose to admire only King Tang of Shang and King Wu of Zhou is an unmistakable indication that by 1897, he had already set revolution as his central task. These two sage-kings were heroes to him because both were described traditionally as “revolutionary” leaders (<i class="calibre9">Tang Wu geming</i> <span>湯</span><span>武</span><span>革</span><span>命</span>), comparable, in his mind at the time, to George Washington in U.S. history. Second, his fascination with the “Way of Darwin” was also significant; it indicated his enthusiasm for change or evolution. Although he had direct access to Darwin’s original works, his interest in Darwinism primarily as a theory of social evolution may have been influenced, directly or indirectly, by Yan Fu’s <span>嚴</span><span>復</span> translation of T. H. Huxley’s <i class="calibre9">Evolution and Ethics</i> (1894),<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2180" id="calibre_link-2262" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> as well as by the Confucian idea of historical “progress” as expounded by the Modern Text (<i class="calibre9">jinwen</i> <span>今</span><span>文</span>) school in the late nineteenth century. Third, his statement about “the literature of the Three Ages of Antiquity and the two Han dynasties” was borrowed from Han Yu’s <span>韓</span><span>愈</span> (768&ndash;824) “Fu Li Ao shu” <span>復</span><span>李</span><span>翱</span><span>書</span> (Letter in reply to Li Ao). By “literature,” Han Yu here referred not to poetry or prose but to the Confucian classics and histories. Thus, with Han Yu’s words in mind, Sun’s intention was in all likelihood to seek a general understanding of China’s cultural heritage to renovate China. Clearly, as a man of action, Sun never had as his primary goal to pursue classical and historical scholarship for its own sake. In this connection, it is perhaps relevant to mention Sun’s view about the “succession of the Way” (<i class="calibre9">daotong</i> <span>道</span><span>統</span>) as formulated by Han Yu.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In his famous essay “Yuandao” <span>原</span><span>道</span> (On the True Way), Han Yu wrote: “What Way is this? It is what I call the Way, and not what the Daoists and Buddhists call the Way. Yao <span>堯</span> taught it to Shun <span>舜</span>, Shun to Yu <span>禹</span>, Yu to Tang <span>湯</span>, and Tang to kings Wen <span>文</span> and Wu <span>武</span> and the Duke of Zhou <span>周</span><span>公</span>. These men taught it to Confucius and Confucius to Mencius, but when Mencius died, it was no longer handed down.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2181" id="calibre_link-2263" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> It is very interesting that when the Comintern emissary J. F. M. Sneevliet (“Maring”) visited Sun in Guilin, Guangxi, in December 1921 and asked him what was his “ground for revolution,” the latter gave him the following answer: “China has a <i class="calibre9">daotong</i> which had been transmitted without interruption from Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and Duke of Zhou to Confucius. My own thought, on the one hand, has been built on the basis of this <i class="calibre9">daotong</i> and, on the other hand, it is also an expansion and development of the <i class="calibre9">daotong.</i>”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2182" id="calibre_link-2264" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2485" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This is a very puzzling statement whose exact meaning is not easy to determine. Some Guomindang writers such as Dai Jitao have concluded from this that Sun ought to be viewed as a true modern heir to the Confucian orthodoxy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2183" id="calibre_link-2265" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> Liberal critics of the Guomindang such as Hu Shi, however, have tended to question the authenticity of the statement.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2184" id="calibre_link-2266" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> Whether Sun actually used the term <i class="calibre9">daotong</i> or not in his conversation is now impossible to know. Authentic or not, it is unmistakable that the statement followed Han Yu’s formulation rather closely. In view of his earlier borrowing from Han Yu, as quoted above, we can safely assume that Sun was, as all educated Chinese of his day, quite familiar with Han Yu’s writings. It would not be surprising if Sun indeed had said something to that effect to Sneevliet in 1921. But it would be an exaggeration to suggest that Sun truly considered himself a modern successor of the Confucian tradition transmitted through the ages by the sages. It seems to me that a more reasonable interpretation would be that Sun probably made the above remark to Sneevliet as a subtle, polite rejection of Marxism. All he was saying was that as China had a distinct and long-lasting cultural tradition of its own, revolutionary principles derived from Marxism were not applicable to the Chinese case. I believe that this is the ideological ground on which he rejected the idea of an alliance with Soviet Russia at that time.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2185" id="calibre_link-2267" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It has been suggested that because Sun “was trained in Western medicine and only semi-trained in the Chinese classics, he never became an insider among the upper-class literati.” Because of this background, “Sun and the Kuomintang [Guomindang <span>國</span><span>民</span><span>黨</span>] had their origins on the cultural frontier between China and the West,” and “Sun’s thinking was not formed in the Confucian mold nor, in fact, in any particular mold.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2186" id="calibre_link-2268" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> Although there is indeed a grain of truth in this observation, it is nevertheless an oversimplified view that fails to take full account of the complex and subtle influences the Chinese tradition has exerted on the molding of Sun’s revolutionary ideology. There can be no question that on the surface, his ideology was largely a mixture, or, better, a synthesis of Western ideas. If we examine more closely the deep structure of his thought, however, we would find that there were, layer after layer, component parts of the Chinese tradition.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>What was unique about the “Chinese tradition” in his thought is rather that it consisted of elements of two different origins: those he appropriated from Chinese elite culture as a result of his study of the Chinese classics and histories and those he absorbed from Chinese popular culture as a result of his early association with overseas Chinese communities and secret societies. There is clear evidence that Sun was torn between the two cultures, especially during the period when his Tong Meng Hui <span>同</span><span>盟</span><span>會</span> was founded. He was faced with the difficult choice of which culture&mdash;the secret societies or the literati&mdash;was to play the leading role in his revolutionary organization.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2187" id="calibre_link-2269" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> The origin of Sun’s thought, therefore, did not simply grow “on the frontier between China and the West.” It also originated at the intersection of elite culture and popular culture within the Chinese tradition.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1162" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>However, because a full-scale investigation of Sun’s ideology lies beyond the scope of the present study, in what follows, I shall confine my discussion to the possible bearing of some of the elite elements in the Chinese tradition on the formation of Sun’s revolutionary vision. As I pointed out earlier, I take Sun’s understanding of the Chinese tradition to be more a reflection, to borrow Wilbur, of “the ideas currently fashionable among the then-radical Chinese intellectuals” than an interpretation all his own. To determine the central ideas about the Chinese tradition that had gained currency in Sun’s time, it is necessary to briefly review the intellectual history of China in the second half of the nineteenth century.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">CHINA’S INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>By the early decades of the nineteenth century, the School of Classical Evidentialism (Kaozheng <span>考</span><span>證</span>) had already passed its peak. Political, social, and economic crises of the time further intensified the intellectuals’ dissatisfaction with the kind of textual study that had become increasingly irrelevant to the actualities of life. As a result, two closely related intellectual developments gradually emerged within the tradition of Confucian learning. The first development was the promotion of practical studies for the purpose of “setting the world in order” (<i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> <span>經</span><span>世</span>). The second was the rise of the so-called Modern Text school (<i class="calibre9">jinwen</i>) in classical learning. As we shall see later, both developments originated in a reorientation of Confucian thought toward reform and change. If we follow the <i class="calibre9">ti-yong</i> <span>體</span><span>用</span> (substance-function) distinction in Neo-Confucianism since the Song Period, we may say that the <i class="calibre9">jinwen</i> school sought to reinterpret the “substance” (<i class="calibre9">ti</i>) of the Confucian Way (<i class="calibre9">Dao</i>), whereas the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> movement was concerned with the “functional” (<i class="calibre9">yong</i>) aspects of the Way in the sense that Confucian learning is not “empty talk” but “practically serviceable to society.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Now let us say something about each of the two developments and then link both to Confucian reformism in the late nineteenth century, which, in turn, provided Sun Yat-sen’s revolutionary ideas a base in the Chinese tradition.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The central text of the Modern Text school is the <i class="calibre9">Chunqiu Gongyang zhuan</i> <span>春</span><span>秋</span><span>公</span><span>羊</span><span>傳</span> (Gongyang Commentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals). According to the Modern Text school, the authorship of the <i class="calibre9">Annals</i> was attributable to Confucius himself. Moreover, of the three commentaries (the other two being the <i class="calibre9">Zuo</i> <span>左</span> and <i class="calibre9">Guliang</i> <span>穀</span><span>梁</span> <i class="calibre9">Commentaries</i>, i.e., <i class="calibre9">Zuozhuan</i> and <i class="calibre9">Guliangzhuan</i>) datable to pre-Han times, the Gongyang text alone has preserved the “original messages of the Sage” because it is believed to have been transmitted orally, from Confucius through an unbroken line of Confucian teachers. Early in Han times, scholars of the Gongyang tradition, such as Dong Zhongshu <span>董</span><span>仲</span><span>舒</span> (ca. 179&ndash;ca. 104 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>), already interpreted the <i class="calibre9">Annals</i> as a text in which Confucius conveyed his ideas as to how a new dynasty should establish its new institutions. Dong Zhongshu also pointed out that Confucius actually divided the 242 years of history covered by the <i class="calibre9">Annals</i> into three stages (or “Three epochs”; <i class="calibre9">sanshi</i> <span>三</span><span>世</span>). Later, the idea of <i class="calibre9">sanshi</i> was further developed by the Gongyang school as representing the Epoch of Disorder, the Epoch of Approaching Peace, and the Epoch of Universal Peace. Thus, a Confucian theory of historical evolution was established.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2188" id="calibre_link-2270" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1238" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the eighteenth century, as all Confucian texts were being subjected to rigorous philological examination under the influence of the School of Classical Evidentialism, the <i class="calibre9">Gongyang Commentary</i> also caught the attention of scholars. For example, Kong Guangsen <span>孔</span><span>廣</span><span>森</span> (1752&ndash;1786), who was a student of Dai Zhen <span>戴</span><span>震</span> (1724&ndash;1777), the great classicist of this school, was the first to write a book on the text entitled <i class="calibre9">Gongyang tongyi</i> <span>公</span><span>羊</span><span>通</span><span>義</span> (A general interpretation of the <i class="calibre9">Gongyang Commentary</i> [Guangzhou, 1860]). However, because this work did not follow the Gongyang tradition closely, it was not accepted by the Modern Text school in late Qing as a valid interpretation. Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929), a latter-day follower of the school, traced the beginning of the Qing Modern Text school to Zhuang Cunyu <span>莊</span><span>存</span><span>與</span> (1719&ndash;1788) and Liu Fenglu <span>劉</span><span>逢</span><span>祿</span> (1776&ndash;1829). As a great pioneer of the Modern Text school, Liang told us, Zhuang “omitted trivial philological points and the nomenclature of artifacts, concentrating only on [elucidating] the so-called ‘great principles hidden in esoteric language.’ ”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2189" id="calibre_link-2271" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>However, it was Liu Fenglu who, following the footsteps of Zhuang, rediscovered the meanings of ideas in the Gongyang tradition of the Han dynasty such as “unfolding the Three Epochs,” “going through the Three Periods of Unity,” and “receiving the mandate to reform institutions.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2190" id="calibre_link-2272" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> In other words, the Modern Text school was trying to redefine the Confucian Way in terms of political and social institutions as opposed to the Neo-Confucian definition in terms of immutable metaphysical principles. According to the new conception of this school, the “substance of the Way” (<i class="calibre9">Daoti</i> <span>道</span><span>體</span>) was embodied in institutions that must of necessity change with history as it moves from one “epoch” to another. It was no longer conceived as a metaphysical entity existing in a transcendent realm.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The flourishing of the Modern Text school owed a great deal to the efforts of two nineteenth-century scholars, Gong Zizhen <span>龔</span><span>自</span><span>珍</span> (1792&ndash;1841) and Wei Yuan <span>魏</span><span>源</span> (1794&ndash;1857). Liang Qichao also had the following succinct account of the two men:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The strong advocates of the Modern Text School were perforce Gong and Wei, during whose lives the Qing government was already becoming weak and decadent. The whole nation was drugged by the enjoyment of peace at that time, but these men, as if they alone sensed national dangers and grievances, often came together to discuss grandiose plans for their country…. Therefore, it was their legacy that prompted later Modern Text scholars to discuss politics in classical terms.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2191" id="calibre_link-2273" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>By “later Modern Text scholars” Liang referred, particularly, to his mentor Kang Youwei <span>康</span><span>有</span><span>為</span> (1858&ndash;1927) and himself.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1120" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The type of practical studies developed under the general term <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> also began about the same time. Moreover, <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> studies were often promoted by the same scholars who led the Modern Text Movement. The idea of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> has been an integral part of Neo-Confucianism since Song times because <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> was predicated on the assumption that the “substance” of the Way must of necessity have its “function” to change the world for better. As an early Song Confucian scholar explained: “To activate this substance [of Dao] and put it into practice throughout the empire, enriching the life of the people and ordering all things to imperial perfection&mdash;this is its function.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2192" id="calibre_link-2274" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As I have pointed out elsewhere, the idea of <i class="calibre9">jingshi zhiyong</i> <span>經</span><span>世</span><span>致</span><span>用</span> (practical use of the Confucian principles in reordering the society) formed a strong undercurrent and pulsed vibrantly in the Neo-Confucian tradition. The Neo-Confucian attempt “to activate the substance of Dao and put it into practice” was ever-present down through the centuries and showed its vitality particularly in times of deepened political and social crises such as in the early seventeenth and the late nineteenth centuries.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2193" id="calibre_link-2275" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> This was clearly shown in the case of the two large collections of essays and proposals concerning practical problems of the Ming and Qing societies, which appeared in 1638 and 1827, respectively. It is no accident that the two works shared the same title, <i class="calibre9">Jingshi wenbian</i> <span>經</span><span>世</span><span>文</span><span>編</span> (Documents on statecraft), for the title of the latter, <i class="calibre9">Huangchao jingshi wenbian</i> <span>皇</span><span>朝</span><span>經</span><span>世</span><span>文</span><span>編</span> (Illustrious Qing dynasty documents on statecraft), compiled by He Changling <span>賀</span><span>長</span><span>齡</span> (1785&ndash;1848), was actually suggested by the former, <i class="calibre9">Huangming jingshi wenbian</i> <span>皇</span><span>明</span><span>經</span><span>世</span><span>文</span><span>編</span> (Illustrious Ming dynasty documents on statecraft), a work completed under the general editorship of Chen Zilong <span>陳</span><span>子</span><span>龍</span> (1680&ndash;1747).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2194" id="calibre_link-2276" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>However, the idea of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> itself was not a simple borrowing from an earlier period. In fact, it had been very much alive throughout the intellectual history of the entire Qing Period. Even at the height of the School of Classical Evidentialism in the eighteenth century, scholars as different as Dai Zhen, Qian Daxin <span>錢</span><span>大</span><span>昕</span> (1728&ndash;1804), and Zhang Xuecheng <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span> (1738&ndash;1801) all agreed that the ultimate test of Confucian principles lay in whether they could be fruitfully applied to the solution of practical problems. Some of Zhang Xuecheng’s ideas were especially influential in the nineteenth century. The rise of the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> school owed much to the inspirations of Zhang’s writings. It was partly due to his influence that a shift of emphasis from classical philology to historical scholarship occurred in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Thus, many <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> scholars turned their attention to more recent history with a view to calling their contemporaries’ attention to the urgency of basic institutional and economic reforms in China. Among them was the above-mentioned Wei Yuan, a powerful advocate of the Modern Text school.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1019" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>If we want to date precisely the beginning of the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> movement in the late Qing, 1827, the publication year of <i class="calibre9">Illustrious Qing Dynasty Documents on Statecraft</i>, is probably as good as any. It is important to note that Wei Yuan was not only the chief assistant to He Changling in the compilation of the <i class="calibre9">Illustrious Qing Dynasty Documents on Statecraft</i> but also the driving force behind the whole project. Following Zhang Xuecheng’s suggestion that historical studies could serve to bring new changes to society (<i class="calibre9">jingshi</i>), He opened up the field of history of the reigning dynasty with special emphasis on its practical relevance to contemporary problems. Salt administration, water conservancy, and grain tribute, which figured centrally in the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> scholarship of the nineteenth century, were the subjects to which he made many notable contributions.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It was characteristic of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> scholarship to study practical matters of immediate relevance to contemporary society. As a result, its content often changed with time. Because Wei Yuan witnessed the Opium War, his <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> writings after 1842 very much reflected the new practical concerns of postwar China. In his important work on the geography of the “maritime countries”&mdash;<i class="calibre9">Haiguo tuzhi</i> <span>海</span><span>國</span><span>圖</span><span>志</span> (Treatise on the maritime countries; compiled in 1842, published in 1844, and expanded in 1847 and 1852), he emphatically pointed out the urgent need for China “to learn the superior skills of the barbarians in order to control them.” By “superior skills of the barbarians” he referred, of course, to the advanced military technology of the West, including, specifically, warships and firearms. This famous statement, it should be noted, was soon to become the slogan of many Chinese reformers.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2195" id="calibre_link-2277" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> Thus, Wei Yuan expanded <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> scholarship beyond its traditional limit to include so-called Western learning, which was to occupy an increasingly central place in Chinese intellectual history over the next several decades.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1198" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This brief sketch shows clearly that since the early nineteenth century, the <i class="calibre9">jinwen</i> school and the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> movement developed in a symbiotic relationship. In the person of Wei Yuan, the two trends actually converged to form a common stream of thought. Wei Yuan’s initial efforts to absorb Western learning into the Chinese <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> was particularly significant. In so doing, he actually paved the way for the development of the idea of “Chinese learning for substance and Western learning for practical application”&mdash;the guiding spirit in the first phase of China’s search for modernization. Later, when Kang Youwei arrived on the scene, we find both the Modern Text and the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> developments well integrated in his intellectual life also. As early as 1891 when Kang wrote his <i class="calibre9">Changxing xueji</i> <span>長</span><span>興</span><span>學</span><span>記</span> (Record of the Changxing Academy) as a teaching guide, he introduced into the curriculum a new category called “<i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> learning.” As he further defined it in a note: “<i class="calibre9">Jingshi</i> learning consists of what is practically applicable to China today. It must accommodate changes as well as suit the needs of the people.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2196" id="calibre_link-2278" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> In his <i class="calibre9">Chronological Autobiography</i> (Zibian nianpu), written in 1895, he gave a brief account of his teaching at the Changxing Academy as follows: “In my daily lectures to students I spoke of the principle of achieving benevolence, of the background of current events in China and abroad, and of the ways for saving China.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2197" id="calibre_link-2279" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup> Clearly, “the principle of achieving benevolence” was the Chinese substance (<i class="calibre9">ti</i>) of his learning, which, needless to say, was none other than the Confucian tradition as reinterpreted by the Modern Text school of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, history (“background of current events”) and reform plans (“ways for saving China”) made up the main content of his <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> learning, which was intended for “practical application” (<i class="calibre9">yong</i>). As I shall try to show in the following section, the traditional elements in Sun Yat-sen’s thought can be better understood in the context of these two interlocking intellectual developments in nineteenth-century China.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">THE INFLUENCE OF THE <i class="calibre5">JINGSHI</i> SCHOOL ON SUN’S THOUGHT</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Sun was not a specialist in Chinese classics or history and during the formative period of his intellectual life, he lived in a cultural world lying on the periphery of the Chinese elite tradition, but he nevertheless followed with close attention and keen interest the new developments in the mainstream of Chinese thought. There is some evidence that around 1893 when both Sun and Kang Youwei lived in Canton, Sun was quite receptive to Kang’s reformist ideas. According to an unofficial account, in 1893 Sun expressed a desire to meet Kang through a friend. However, because Kang insisted that he would receive Sun only if Sun were to come as a student, the meeting never took place.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2198" id="calibre_link-2280" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> This story itself may well be a fabrication, but there can be little doubt that Sun must have heard about Kang’s teachings through their mutual acquaintances. Between 1893 and 1896, there were contacts between Kang and his students on the one hand and Sun and his followers on the other. The possibility of cooperation between the two groups was discussed, though nothing came out of it.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2199" id="calibre_link-2281" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It should be noted that before 1893, Kang had completed his major Modern Text studies with reformist themes such as <i class="calibre9">Xinxue weijing kao</i> <span>新</span><span>學</span><span>偽</span><span>經</span><span>考</span> (A study of the forged classics of the Xin period; 1891) and <i class="calibre9">Kongzi gaizhi kao</i> <span>孔</span><span>子</span><span>改</span><span>制</span><span>考</span> (A study of Confucius as a reformer; 1897). Moreover, as early as 1890, when Chen Qianqiu <span>陳</span><span>千</span><span>秋</span> and Liang Qichao came to study with him, Kang already told them about his new ideas concerning Confucian political philosophy, including the theory of the “three stages of evolution to reach the world of Universal Peace” (<i class="calibre9">taiping</i> <span>太</span><span>平</span>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2200" id="calibre_link-2282" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> Later, his study of the “Liyun” <span>禮</span><span>運</span> (Evolution of Rites) chapter in the <i class="calibre9">Liji</i> (Classic of Rites) led to the rediscovery of the idea of <i class="calibre9">Datong</i> <span>大</span><span>同</span> (Great Unity or Universal Commonwealth) and an early version of the <i class="calibre9">Datong shu</i> <span>大</span><span>同</span><span>書</span> (Book of Great Unity) was drafted as a result. Both Chen Qianqiu and Liang Qichao were greatly excited by this utopian work. Many years later, Liang Qichao recalled that among his students, only Chen Qianqiu and Liang Qichao were permitted to read this book at first. They enjoyed reading it tremendously and were bent on making parts of it public. Kang did not encourage this, but he could not prevent them from doing so either, and from that time forth, students at the Wanmu Caotang <span>萬</span><span>木</span><span>草</span><span>堂</span> all talked about the universal commonwealth.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2201" id="calibre_link-2283" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1110" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Moreover, Chen Qianqiu, who was a political activist, was reportedly among Kang’s students who had several meetings with Sun Yat-sen.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2202" id="calibre_link-2284" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> Even if we dismiss the report about Chen Qianqiu’s connection with Sun as unreliable, it is nevertheless quite safe to assume that Sun must have become familiar with some of Kang’s ideas derived from the Modern Text tradition, among which was the idea of <i class="calibre9">Datong</i> in the “Liyun” text. As a matter of fact, this particular text had made so profound an impression on Sun’s mind that later in his life, he often chose it for calligraphic exercises. Apart from his inscription of his favorite phrase “the nation is for all” (<i class="calibre9">tianxia weigong</i> <span>天</span><span>下</span><span>為</span><span>公</span>), he also made a full inscription of the <i class="calibre9">Datong</i> passage in the “Liyun” text that has become the most famous specimen of his calligraphy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2203" id="calibre_link-2285" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Whatever intellectual debt Kang Youwei may have owed to other Modern Text scholars, he alone must be credited with the rediscovery and reinterpretation of the “Liyun” text, with a reformist emphasis on the ideas of <i class="calibre9">Datong</i> and “evolution.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2204" id="calibre_link-2286" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> It is difficult to determine exactly when and how Sun Yat-sen first became fascinated with ideas of the “Liyun” text. Judging by the circumstances, however, it may not be too far-fetched to suggest that Kang’s ingenious use of its ideas to ground his reformist ideology that had greatly excited his disciples may also have sharpened Sun’s awareness of the text’s revolutionary significance during the short period (1893&ndash;1896) when initial contacts were being made between the two groups. As we have seen, Chen Qianqiu and Liang Qichao did try to publicize Kang’s utopian ideas such as <i class="calibre9">Datong</i> and <i class="calibre9">sanshi</i> around this time. At any rate, with the publication of Kang’s <i class="calibre9">A Study of Confucius as a Reformer</i> in 1897, these ideas were soon to become household words in China. Given Sun’s acuity, it would be inconceivable for him to have remained totally unaffected by Kang’s views about the Chinese cultural tradition.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As we shall see later, Sun’s understanding of other aspects of early Chinese culture also showed traces of Kang’s interpretations. However, to speak of Kang’s influence in this area is by no means to suggest that Sun had been at any time totally captivated by Kang’s thought. Sun could not be a slavish follower of any particular school of thought, Chinese or Western. This was true with respect not only to his absorption of Western theories but also to his pursuit of Chinese learning. My point is that because Kang Youwei was the dominant figure in the Chinese intellectual world during the last decade of the nineteenth century&mdash;which happened to coincide with the period in which Sun’s thought grew into full maturity&mdash;it was only natural that the latter appropriated some of the former’s new interpretations of the Confucian classics for his own purposes. Nor was Kang the only influence through which Sun sought to understand his own cultural tradition vis-<span>à</span>-vis modernization. As his own revolutionary vision was gradually being crystallized, he was also modifying his views of the Chinese tradition in a variety of ways. In the course of his intellectual development, as will become clear below, he also learned from other scholars about Chinese culture and history, and eventually outgrew the initial influence of Kang’s Modern Text frame of reference.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1148" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Next, we must briefly consider Sun Yat-sen’s intellectual relation with <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> learning, the other major scholarly movement in the late Qing Period. As mentioned earlier, as early as the time of Wei Yuan, <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> studies had already been expanded beyond the traditional limit to include so-called Western learning. As time went on, Western learning was acquiring an ever-growing importance in the Chinese intellectual world. When Zhang Zhidong coined the famous maxim “Chinese learning as substance, Western learning for practical application” in 1898, Western learning had almost become an independent field of study. Historically, however, the development of Western learning in nineteenth-century China from Wei Yuan to Zhang Zhidong must be viewed as an offshoot of the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> movement. In his essay “Xixue” <span>西</span><span>學</span> (Western learning), dated 1892, Zheng Guanying also offered the formulation “Chinese learning as root [<i class="calibre9">ben</i> <span>本</span>] and Western learning as branch [<i class="calibre9">mo</i> <span>末</span>].”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2205" id="calibre_link-2287" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Both Zhang Zhidong’s and Zheng Guanying’s formulations, it may be noted, were originally adapted from the traditional idea that in Confucian learning, the study of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> constitutes its “substance” (<i class="calibre9">ti</i>) while the “ordering of the world” (<i class="calibre9">jingshi</i>) constitutes its “practical application” (<i class="calibre9">yong</i>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2206" id="calibre_link-2288" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup> Viewing Western learning as an extension of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> learning, we can immediately see that Sun was very much at the center of the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> movement as it evolved in the last decade of the nineteenth century. Sun’s intellectual tie with late Qing <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> learning may best be illustrated by his famous “Letter to Li Hongzhang” (Shang Li Hongzhang shu) of 1894. His letter said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>After deep reflection, I realize that the roots of wealth and power in Europe do not lie entirely in solid ships, efficient guns, strong forts, and crack troops, but also in that a man can use his talents to the utmost, a piece of land can produce to the utmost, natural resources can be exploited to the utmost, and commercial goods can be circulated almost without restriction.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>A few paragraphs later, he further elaborated his points in the following words:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>When a man can use his ability to the utmost, all enterprises will be undertaken; when the land can yield to the utmost, people will have enough to eat; when natural resources can be exploited to the utmost, the national economic strength will be great; when commodities can be circulated without restriction, financial resources will be abundant. Thus these four elements are the principal sources of wealth and power, and provide the solid foundations of a nation.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2207" id="calibre_link-2289" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1297" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>First, let me point out that the central idea of the letter reflected faithfully the general mood of thinking of <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> scholars around this time. In redefining the concept of Western learning, for example, Zhang Zhidong distinguished between what he called “Western technology,” including “solid ships” and “efficient guns,” on the one hand, and what he called “Western institutions,” including the school system, financial organization, and promotion of commerce and industry, on the other. He considered Western institutions to be far more important than Western technology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2208" id="calibre_link-2290" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup> Clearly, this is also the message of Sun’s letter.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The main thrust of the letter was a call for the full development of China’s human and natural resources through better education, improvement of agriculture, industrialization, and encouragement of commerce. These ideas were also largely in agreement with the views of his reform-oriented contemporaries such as Zheng Guanying <span>鄭</span><span>觀</span><span>應</span>, Ma Jianzhong <span>馬</span><span>建</span><span>中</span>, Zhang Jian <span>張</span><span>謇</span>, Yan Fu, and Kang Youwei.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2209" id="calibre_link-2291" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup> Interestingly, it has been noted that Sun’s letter bore a remarkable resemblance to the preface of Zheng Guanying’s <i class="calibre9">Shengshi weiyan</i> <span>盛</span><span>世</span><span>危</span><span>言</span> (Warnings to a prosperous age; 1892) not only in ideas but in language as well. Zheng, like Sun, argued that the “source of foreign wealth and power do not altogether lie in solid ships and effective guns.” He also listed three of Sun’s four elements as matters of utmost urgency for China: “Let human talents be fully used; let the land be fully used; and allow for the free flow of materials.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2210" id="calibre_link-2292" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup> But this striking similarity should occasion no surprise, for, according to one account, Sun had actually consulted Zheng in the writing of this letter.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2211" id="calibre_link-2293" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup> Moreover, Sun’s letter was first published in October 1894 in the <i class="calibre9">Wanguo gongbao</i> <span>萬</span><span>國</span><span>公</span><span>報</span>, a Shanghai-based journal sponsored by foreign missionaries and of which Zheng was a patron.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2212" id="calibre_link-2294" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup> It is quite possible that Zheng may have helped in its publication.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>What is particularly significant about Sun’s letter from the point of view of intellectual history, however, is that it can be traced to a <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> origin. As early as the 1860s, Feng Guifen <span>馮</span><span>桂</span><span>芬</span> (1809&ndash;1874) wrote in his <i class="calibre9">Jiaobinlu kangyi</i> <span>校</span><span>邠</span><span>廬</span><span>抗</span><span>議</span> (Straightforward words from the lodge of Early Zhou studies):</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Regarding the present situation there are several major points: in making use of the ability of manpower, with no one neglected, we are inferior to the barbarians; in securing the benefit of the soil, with nothing wasted, we are inferior to the barbarian; in maintaining a close relationship between the ruler and the people, with no barrier between them, we are inferior to the barbarians; and in the necessary accord of word with deed, we are inferior to the barbarians.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2213" id="calibre_link-2295" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1298" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Obviously, the first two points in this passage agreed exactly with their counterparts in both Zheng’s preface and Sun’s letter quoted above. It is therefore only natural that scholars tend to interpret the three documents in terms of a genealogy of ideas.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2214" id="calibre_link-2296" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup> We do not know for sure whether Sun got his ideas directly from Feng’s work or indirectly through Zheng Guanying. However, it must be pointed out emphatically that Feng’s <i class="calibre9">Straightforward Words from the Lodge of Early Zhou Studies</i> was very influential in the reform-minded elite circles. It went through many editions after 1861, and in 1892, it was simultaneously republished in Suzhou and Wuchang (Hubei), a fact testifying fully to its importance as well as its popularity. Therefore, in 1894, when Sun wrote his letter to Li Hongzhang, Sun must have been familiar, one way or another, with many of Feng’s views, which were, so to speak, very much in the air. As for Zheng Guanying, it is almost a certainty that he had direct access to the book.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2215" id="calibre_link-2297" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">43</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The establishment of Sun’s intellectual relationship with Feng Guifen is of considerable importance to our understanding of Sun’s overall attitude toward the Chinese cultural tradition. Feng Guifen was the foremost leader of the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> school during the Tongzhi Restoration (1862&ndash;1874). The simple fact that along with keeping abreast of Kang Youwei’s reformist interpretation of the Confucian classics, Sun also followed closely every new development in the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> movement indicates that he was, after all, not so much outside the mainstream of Chinese thought in the late nineteenth century as people have generally assumed. It is one thing to say that he was not readily accepted by the Chinese elite circles in the early stage of his revolutionary life, but it is an entirely different matter to suggest that because he was not a trained classicist or historian, he was largely unaware of what was going on in the Chinese intellectual world. In fact, the contrary is true. We have reason to believe that the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> school exerted a lasting influence on his thought with regard to the role he assigned to China’s cultural heritage in the historical process of its modernization. Feng Guifen wrote in his essay “On the Adoption of Western Knowledge” (Cai Xixue yi; 1861): “If we let Chinese ethics and moral teachings serve as an original foundation, and let them be supplemented by the methods used by the various nations for attainment of prosperity and strength, would it not be the best of all procedures?”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2216" id="calibre_link-2298" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">44</a></small></sup> With this particular passage in mind, Mary C. Wright offered the following perceptive analysis of Feng’s vision as a whole:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Feng Guifen anticipated by a generation Zhang Zhidong’s famous maxim, “Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for practical use.” Feng did not take the naïve view that China could meet the Western challenge simply by borrowing technology. Rather, having grasped technology’s contribution to the internal strength of Western society in the nineteenth century, he urged a re-examination of China’s own civilization and a creation from Chinese materials of a strong modern China. This was certainly learning from the West, but it was not imitations of the West except in limited technical fields.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2217" id="calibre_link-2299" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">45</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1200" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>I believe this characterization may very well apply, mutatis mutandis, also to Sun Yat-sen. Needless to say, with his profound knowledge of the West, Sun could not possibly subscribe to Zhang Zhidong’s <span>張</span><span>之</span><span>洞</span> simplistic formulation. It is nevertheless an undeniable fact that in the course of the long evolution of his revolutionary vision, he never for a moment toyed with the idea that modernization could be accomplished only at the cost of tradition. On the contrary, he painfully struggled to reconcile modernization with what he perceived to be the essence of Chinese culture. It was probably for this reason that he even equated “revolution” with “restoration” when he delivered a speech at the welcome meeting organized by the Chinese students in Tokyo on February 23, 1913. “The present revolution in China,” he said, “is actually a restoration of the culture that had been historically achieved several thousand years ago.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2218" id="calibre_link-2300" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">46</a></small></sup> Here Sun’s words remind us of Feng Guifen, who also spoke of China’s “self-strengthening” in terms of “restoration” of the best of ancient institutions to their original vigor.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2219" id="calibre_link-2301" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">47</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">THE TRADITIONAL HERITAGE OF THE THREE PRINCIPLES OF THE PEOPLE</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>This final section will be devoted to a discussion of Sun Yat-sen’s views of the Chinese traditions as expressed, mainly, in his lecture on the three Principles of the People. As Xiao Gongquan rightly observed, Sun’s political philosophy was a creative synthesis of traditional Chinese theories and modern Western sources.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2220" id="calibre_link-2302" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">48</a></small></sup> In what follows, I propose to examine this “Chinese base” in the Three Principles of the People, according to their original order.</span></div>
<div class="head2"><span class="calibre4">N<small class="calibre6">ATIONALISM</small></span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>In an article entitled “A History of the Chinese Revolution” (Zhongguo geming shi), dated January 29, 1923, Sun wrote: “Nationalist thought is a heritage bequeathed to us by our ancestors that need not be imported from outside. The nationalism I hold is nothing but an elaborated version of what I have inherited from the past.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2221" id="calibre_link-2303" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">49</a></small></sup> A deeper analysis shows that the origins of the particular kind of nationalism he espoused can be traced back to the anti-Manchuism of early Qing thinkers, especially Wang Fuzhi <span>王</span><span>夫</span><span>之</span> (1619&ndash;1692). In Lecture 1 of “The Principle of Nationalism” (Minzu zhuyi), Sun defined “race in terms of such factors as blood kinship, common language, common livelihood, common religion and common habits. For simplicity we may divide these factors into two basic categories: blood kinship, or ‘consanguinity,’ constitutes a category by itself while the rest may all be grouped together under the category of ‘culture.’ ” Sun said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1013" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Considering the law of survival of ancient and modern races, if we want to save China and to preserve the Chinese race, we must certainly preserve Nationalism. To make this principle luminous for China’s salvation we must first understand it clearly. The Chinese race totals four hundred million people; of mingled races there are only a few million Mongolians, a million or so Manchus, a few million Tibetans, and over a million Mohammedan Turks. These alien races do not number altogether more than ten million, so that for the most part, the Chinese people are of the Han or Chinese race with common blood, common language, common religion, and common customs&mdash;a single, pure race.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2222" id="calibre_link-2304" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">50</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Thus, his position may be described as Han-centric culturalism based on the idea of consanguinity. I consider this to be a residual product of his early anti-Manchu revolutionary experience. Before 1911, many revolutionary intellectuals in Tokyo, such as Chen Tianhua <span>陳</span><span>天</span><span>華</span> (1875&ndash;1905) and Zhang Binglin <span>章</span><span>炳</span><span>麟</span> (1868&ndash;1936), not only subscribed to this Han-centric culturalism but even developed it to its extreme. Zhang Binglin, for example, contended on the authority of Wang Fuzhi that “cultural identity rises from consanguinity.” According to this view, because the Manchus were only a minority in China, they must, like other minorities, accept the majority rule of the Han race and become fully “assimilated” by the Han culture.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2223" id="calibre_link-2305" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">51</a></small></sup> The idea of “assimilation” remained important to Sun’s brand of nationalism even after the revolution. In a popular lecture on the Three Principles of the People delivered in June 1921, he repeatedly struck the note that “the Manchus, the Mongolians, the Mohammedan Turks, and the Tibetans must all be assimilated by our Han Chinese so that we can become a great nation.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2224" id="calibre_link-2306" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">52</a></small></sup> In this particular case, we can see clearly that Sun’s Han-centric culturalism must have been strengthened, if not inspired, by his intellectual interactions with other revolutionary scholars, especially Zhang Binglin. Once again, Sun’s view reflected what was “currently fashionable among the then-radical Chinese intellectuals.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1086" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>However, viewed as a whole in historical perspective, the cultural dimension of Sun’s nationalism is far more significant than its Han-centric element. It is in its cultural dimension that we find his nationalism transcending the narrow political limit of the concept. His love of China included its culture and history; he did not see his native land merely as a political community. In other words, his idea of nationalism was closer to that of Johann Gottfried von Herder and the Romanticists, which emphasized cultural criteria such as mother tongue, ancient folk tradition, common descent, or the “national spirit” rather than political identity.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2225" id="calibre_link-2307" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">53</a></small></sup> Like the Romanticists, Sun sometimes also tended to glorify China’s remote past. In Lecture 6 of “The Principle of Nationalism,” he paid the highest tribute to the spiritual achievements of ancient Chinese. Confucian moral ideals, political philosophy, and method of personal cultivation were, in his view, all superior to their Western counterparts. Labeling these as “old learning” and “old morality,” he went on to stress: “We must revive not only our old morality but also our old learning…. If we want to regain our national spirit, we must reawaken the learning as well as the moral ideals that we once possessed.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2226" id="calibre_link-2308" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">54</a></small></sup> Here, whereas his talk of “national spirit” reminds us of Herder and the Romanticists, his talk of “reviving old morality and old learning” betrays the lingering influence of the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> scholars of the previous century, such as Feng Guifen and Zhang Zhidong. There cannot be the slightest doubt about Sun’s profound commitment to the core values in the Chinese cultural tradition. In 1918, on the eve of the May Fourth Movement, when he was composing his famous treatise on “Knowledge is difficult, action is easy,” he calmly discussed the controversy of “spiritual culture” versus “material culture,” then very much in vogue. Although freely admitting that the two “cultures” were indeed closely interrelated, he nevertheless insisted that in some areas of spiritual culture, China was either equal or even superior to the West. China’s inferiority vis-<span>à</span>-vis the West lay entirely in the domain of material culture. In this case, he was responding to the New Culture Movement (including the <i class="calibre9">baihua</i> <span>白</span><span>話</span>, or vernacular literature) launched by the editors and contributors of <i class="calibre9">Xin Qingnian</i> <span>新</span><span>青</span><span>年</span> (New Youth) such as Chen Duxiu <span>陳</span><span>獨</span><span>秀</span> (1899&ndash;1939), Qian Xuantong <span>錢</span><span>玄</span><span>同</span> (1887&ndash;1939), and Hu Shi (1891&ndash;1962). Sun stated without any hesitation: “Among today’s scholars of the New Learning, there are people who are advocating abolition of the Chinese script. But in my opinion, the Chinese script must not be abolished.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2227" id="calibre_link-2309" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">55</a></small></sup> Clearly, this is a rebuttal to Qian Xuantong, who considered the ideographic script an obstacle to modernization and suggested its replacement by romanization.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the same treatise, we also find Sun praising Zhou civilization in the highest possible terms: “Chinese civilization had reached a high point by the Western Zhou Period. At that time, political institutions, morality, literature, learning, and technology had all developed to a level almost comparable to those in modern Europe and America.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2228" id="calibre_link-2310" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">56</a></small></sup> Historians will no doubt be quick to point out that he had accepted uncritically the idealized picture of the Zhou dynasty as described in inauthentic texts. However, this is beside the point; he not only honestly believed but also took tremendous pride in the Chinese “national spirit” inherent in humanistic, moral culture that had flourished in classical antiquity. One may even be tempted to suggest that his profound faith in Chinese culture was one of the spiritual forces that supported him through all of his frustrating revolutionary experiences. It is indeed true that he welcomed the May Fourth Movement with genuine enthusiasm and openly acknowledged that his own revolution “must depend on a change of thought in China.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2229" id="calibre_link-2311" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">57</a></small></sup> Yet there is no evidence that the radical antitraditionalism of the movement had changed his long-held view about Chinese cultural tradition in a fundamental way. On March 2, 1924, he spoke as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1267" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>But even if we succeed in reviving our ancient morality, learning, and powers, we will still not be able, in this modern world, to advance China to a first place among the nations. If we can reproduce the best of our national heritage just as it was in the time of our forefathers when China dominated the world, we will still need to learn the strong points of Europe and America before we can progress at an equal rate with them.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2230" id="calibre_link-2312" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">58</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Here, we do detect a subtle shift in emphasis from “reviving” China’s past to “learning” from the West. His faith in cultural nationalism remained, nevertheless, as unshaken as ever.</span></div>
<div class="head2"><span class="calibre4">D<small class="calibre6">EMOCRACY</small></span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Of his <i class="calibre9">minquan zhuyi</i> <span>民</span><span>權</span><span>主</span><span>義</span>, or Principle of Democracy, Sun said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In ancient China, there were abdications of Yao and Shun as well as the changes of the Mandate of Heaven (<i class="calibre9">geming</i>, “revolution”) of King Tang and King Wu. As for theories, there were statements like “Heaven sees with the eyes of its people. Heaven hears with the ears of its people,” “The people are of supreme importance; the sovereign comes last,” “I have indeed heard of the punishment of the outcast Zhou, but have not heard of any regicide,” “the people are of supreme importance; the sovereign comes last.” So we cannot say that democratic ideas have been lacking in China. However, what we have are ideas but not institutions.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2231" id="calibre_link-2313" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">59</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>In his Lecture 1 of “The Principle of Democracy,” he repeated the same idea with the same quotes from Mencius except adding the “Liyun” slogan, “when the great <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> prevails, the nation is for all.” As the “Liyun” text has been traditionally attributed to Confucius&mdash;and Kang Youwei had made quite a point of that in his various writings before the reform of 1898&mdash;Sun therefore could say with justification that “Confucius and Mencius spoke two thousand years ago for people’s rights.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2232" id="calibre_link-2314" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">60</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1269" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>One can see that there was a gradual emergence and formation of a common discourse from the time of Kang Youwei and that it cut across the political or doxographical lines such as between the Revolutionaries and Reformists or between the New Text school and the Old Text school. One interesting feature of this discussion is that the change-oriented Chinese intellectuals all tended to reinterpret certain key Chinese classical and historical texts in light of the Western values they hoped to introduce to China. The idea of <i class="calibre9">minquan</i> or <i class="calibre9">minzhu</i> is a case in point. Kang Youwei, as has been well known, stretched his text to identify the Age of Universal Peace with <i class="calibre9">minzhu</i> <span>民</span><span>主</span> (people’s rule, or democracy). Thus, he also came to the conclusion that Yao and Shun stood for “Universal Peace under the people’s rule.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2233" id="calibre_link-2315" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">61</a></small></sup> On the revolutionary side, interestingly enough, we find that scholars of the famous <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> <span>國</span><span>粹</span> (national essence) school were engaged in exactly the same kind of textual interpretation in the first decade of the present century. Some cited the Chinese counterpart of <i class="calibre9">Vox populi vox Dei</i>, the “Liyun” slogan quoted earlier, to “prove” that <i class="calibre9">minquan</i> (democracy) as a theory had appeared in Chinese history much earlier than in the West. Others echoed Kang Youwei in his claim that in classical antiquity, the Chinese system of government was indeed based on the principle “the nation is for all.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2234" id="calibre_link-2316" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">62</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Even such marginal intellectuals as He Qi <span>何</span><span>啟</span> (He Gai) and Hu Liyuan <span>胡</span><span>禮</span><span>垣</span>, with whom Sun had been closely associated in his early years, participated in this discourse. Like Kang Youwei, they also interpreted the age of Yao and Shun as the “age of democracy” (<i class="calibre9">minzhu</i>). The idea of <i class="calibre9">minquan</i> (people’s power, or people’s rights), according to them, had been most clearly articulated in ancient China, especially by Mencius. Moreover, they also directly responded to and reflected on Kang Youwei’s theory about “the nation is for all” (<i class="calibre9">tianxia weigong</i>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2235" id="calibre_link-2317" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">63</a></small></sup> In view of these facts, I am very much inclined to think that Sun Yat-sen’s definitive views of the Chinese cultural tradition as a whole had been formed gradually over the decades as he followed closely the development of this discussion. His use of the term <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> (national essence, or national characteristics), originally a borrowing from the Japanese <i class="calibre9">kokusui</i>, also revealed his intellectual tie to the <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> school and its influential journal, <i class="calibre9">Guocui xuebao</i> <span>國</span><span>粹</span><span>學</span><span>報</span><i class="calibre9">.</i><sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2236" id="calibre_link-2318" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">64</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>His theory of the five-power government deserves some attention, too. Why did he insist on a five-power system instead of the three-power division as generally practiced in the West? His own justification ran as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>What is the source of the two new features in our quintuple-power constitution? They come from old China. China long ago had the independent systems of civil service examination and censorship and they were very effective…. The power of censorship includes the power to impeach, which other governments have but which is placed in the legislative body and is not a separate governmental power. The selection of real talent and ability through examinations has been characteristic of China for thousands of years…. If we now want to combine the best from China and the best from other countries and guard against all kinds of abuse in the future, we must take the three Western governmental powers&mdash;the executive, legislative, and judicial&mdash;and add to them the old Chinese powers of examination and censorship, and bring the system to perfection, a quintuple-power government.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2237" id="calibre_link-2319" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">65</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1135" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Obviously, the revision resulted largely from his own study and understanding of the Chinese political tradition. But he probably had also interacted with other scholars on this subject. Zhang Binglin, for instance, also independently proposed, in 1908, a four-power governmental system with education as the fourth branch.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2238" id="calibre_link-2320" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">66</a></small></sup> It is characteristic of Sun that he did not want to do away with the Chinese tradition completely, nor was he willing to copy any Western model without due modifications.</span></div>
<div class="head2"><span class="calibre4">T<small class="calibre6">HE</small> P<small class="calibre6">RINCIPLE OF</small> L<small class="calibre6">IVELIHOOD</small></span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>In his lectures on the Three Principles of the People, Sun Yat-sen referred to his <i class="calibre9">minsheng zhuyi</i> <span>民</span><span>生</span><span>主</span><span>義</span>, the Principle of the People’s Livelihood, as something comparable to socialism or even communism. This reference could be misleading, and indeed it has given rise to a great deal of ideological controversy since his death. As I have argued elsewhere, he made this particular reference in 1924 primarily as an expedient, strategic move to accommodate the Chinese Communists during the Nationalist-Communist coalition period.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2239" id="calibre_link-2321" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">67</a></small></sup> No doubt, he was extremely familiar with various socialist ideas then current in the West. On the whole, however, his Principle of the People’s Livelihood was conceived from the beginning in traditional Chinese terms in spite of the fact that he formulated it in a thoroughly modern way by taking into full consideration recent experiences of Western capitalist societies. The simple fact that he deliberately chose the Chinese term <i class="calibre9">minsheng</i> for his principle is sufficient proof of its Chinese base. The term, as he explained very clearly, derived from the phrase <i class="calibre9">guoji minsheng</i> (finance of the state and the people’s livelihood).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2240" id="calibre_link-2322" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">68</a></small></sup> <i class="calibre9">Guoji</i> and <i class="calibre9">minsheng</i> <span>國</span><span>計</span><span>民</span><span>生</span> originated as two separate terms traceable to pre-Qin texts; their combination into one phrase was relatively late in origin. It remains to be discovered precisely when the phrase first occurred. However, it is noteworthy that the idea of <i class="calibre9">guoji minsheng</i> had been given a new emphasis during the Tongzhi Restoration.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2241" id="calibre_link-2323" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">69</a></small></sup> From that time on, the idea was very much in the consciousness of Chinese intellectuals, especially those who were concerned with practical statecraft along <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> lines. Sun’s terminological choice more or less reflected the <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> legacy he had inherited in his early intellectual life.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In formulating the Principle of People’s Livelihood, Sun seems to have had the Confucian idea of equalization (<i class="calibre9">jun</i> <span>均</span>) very much in the back of his mind. Speaking of the <i class="calibre9">minsheng</i> principle in 1919, he specifically quoted the famous saying of Confucius that a state ought to “worry not about poverty but about unequal distribution.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2242" id="calibre_link-2324" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">70</a></small></sup> It was mainly out of this concern with equalization that he praised the well-field (<i class="calibre9">jingtian</i> <span>井</span><span>田</span>) system as the best land system in ancient China. According to the well-field system, farmland was divided into grids containing nine squares, three by three. The outer squares were distributed to eight families, and these families cultivated the central section collectively for the government. He went so far as to suggest that the well-field system agreed essentially with his idea about “equalization of landed power” (<i class="calibre9">pingjun diquan</i> <span>平</span><span>均</span><span>地</span><span>權</span>), one of the two major components of his Principle of the People’s Livelihood, the other one being the “regulation of capital.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2243" id="calibre_link-2325" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">71</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1077" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In this connection, the influence of his conversations with intellectuals must be noted. According to a contemporary’s account, during the 1898 to 1899 period, Sun often discussed land systems in Chinese history with Chinese intellectuals in Tokyo, including Liang Qichao and Zhang Binglin. Their topics ranged from the well-field system, the equal field (<i class="calibre9">juntian</i> <span>均</span><span>田</span>) system (by which land was divided equally among farm families), to the idea of “public granary” in the Taiping ideology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2244" id="calibre_link-2326" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">72</a></small></sup> They seem to have been in basic agreement about the socialist nature of the well-field or equal field system. The identification of the well-field system with socialism was probably also inspired by Kang Youwei, who believed the <i class="calibre9">jingtian</i> system to be a device of Confucius. As Kang’s leading disciple, Liang Qichao, wrote in 1899, “China’s ancient <i class="calibre9">jingtian</i> system stands on the same plane as modern socialism.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2245" id="calibre_link-2327" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">73</a></small></sup> In 1906, Zhang Binglin said the same thing about the <i class="calibre9">juntian</i> system: “One especially excellent thing that absolutely cannot be matched by the West is the <i class="calibre9">juntian</i> system, which corresponds to socialism.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2246" id="calibre_link-2328" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">74</a></small></sup> In the same year, Hu Hanmin <span>胡</span><span>漢</span><span>民</span> (1879&ndash;1936) also expressed the view with Sun’s approval that the well-field system was a socialist model in ancient China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2247" id="calibre_link-2329" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">75</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The idea of equalization (<i class="calibre9">jun</i>) was also central to the other component of Sun’s <i class="calibre9">minsheng</i> principle, “regulation of capital.” In this area, Sun’s proposal amounted to what is generally known as “state capitalism,” with all the major industries and public utilities and transportation placed under the direct control and management of the state. It seems to have been his firm belief that this was the only way to guarantee distributive justice in economic life. His strong advocacy of “state capitalism” was apparently prompted by the unequal distribution of wealth he witnessed in Western capitalistic societies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2248" id="calibre_link-2330" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">76</a></small></sup> However, I suspect that in this area his economic thinking may also have been influenced by the Chinese tradition. Given his broad knowledge of Chinese institutional history, he must have been familiar with the practice of state monopolies of salt and iron since the Han dynasty. It was therefore only natural that he was well disposed to favor state capitalism. Moreover, in the thought of the time, it was almost an unquestioned assumption that industry and commerce must be run by the state to prevent the growth of gross inequality in the allocation and distribution of wealth. Kang Youwei, for example, also considered public ownership and management of all industrial and commercial firms (<i class="calibre9">gonggong</i> <span>公</span><span>共</span> and <i class="calibre9">gongshang</i> <span>工</span><span>商</span>) an essential feature of his utopian Universal Commonwealth (<i class="calibre9">Datong</i>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2249" id="calibre_link-2331" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">77</a></small></sup> It is commonly known that the public (<i class="calibre9">gong</i> <span>公</span>) has always been emphasized in the Chinese tradition as a positive social value compared to selfishness (<i class="calibre9">si</i> <span>私</span>). After all, the meaning of Sun’s Principle of the People’s Livelihood cannot be fully grasped without a deeper understanding of his commitment to traditional Chinese values.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1171" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>I would like to end this section with a note on Sun Yat-sen’s famous thesis, “Knowledge is difficult and action is easy” (<i class="calibre9">zhi nan xing yi</i> <span>知</span><span>難</span><span>行</span><span>易</span>). In 1918, after having been repeatedly frustrated by the fact that even his own followers had lost faith in his revolutionary cause, he wrote a treatise entitled “Sun Wen xueshuo” (The Doctrine of Sun Wen). He apparently believed that true faith could be established only on the foundation of true knowledge. His followers failed to act according to his principles because they never really understood them. In the preface to this treatise, he traced the source of the trouble to the dictum in the Confucian <i class="calibre9">Shangshu</i> (Classic of History), “To know is not difficult, but to act is.” It was this single habit of thinking in Chinese tradition, he said, that stood very much in the way of his revolution. He was, therefore, determined to destroy this erroneous notion.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2250" id="calibre_link-2332" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">78</a></small></sup> In the treatise, he also attacked Wang Yangming’s theory of “the unity of knowledge and action” because it implicitly took the <i class="calibre9">Classic of History</i> dictum as its very assumption. His own thesis, “Knowledge is difficult and action is easy,” was thus intended as a contradiction of the traditional view. He was gratified that his thesis was positively confirmed by John Dewey when the latter visited him in Shanghai. Knowing these things, can we then conclude that Sun had, in 1918, rebelled against Chinese tradition? The answer must be negative, for he soon made it clear that in formulating his thesis or, rather, antithesis, he was actually following the correct view of Confucius and Mencius.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2251" id="calibre_link-2333" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">79</a></small></sup> As a matter of fact, had he known better, he could well have cited Zhu Xi <span>朱</span><span>熹</span> (1130&ndash;1200) and, more recently, Dai Zhen in his support, for his view is surely much closer to the Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucian tradition, with its emphasis on knowledge as a prerequisite for action.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2252" id="calibre_link-2334" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">80</a></small></sup> Sun most certainly did not intend to break with tradition when he joined this time-honored knowledge-versus-action debate. It hardly needs mentioning that knowledge-versus-action as a philosophical category has been a marked characteristic of Chinese thought for well over two millennia. To think in this very category at all, I may add, is to take tradition seriously, not to dismiss it.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In 1913, Sun Yat-sen made the following remark in a speech: “The recent Chinese revolution is actually a restoration of the civilization that has existed in our history for several thousand years.” To equate “revolution” with “restoration” does sound odd&mdash;a contradiction in terms. But his audience applauded loudly.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2253" id="calibre_link-2335" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">81</a></small></sup> It is truly remarkable that Sun as a revolutionary leader lived a life of constant tension between revolution and restoration, innovation and tradition, as well as continuity and rupture, and yet showed little sign of a failure of nerve. This phenomenon seems to speak as much for Sun Yat-sen as for his culture. His admiration for Western civilization and his love of his own cultural tradition were both authentic. By founding the republic, he may be truly said to have given China a rebirth. The republic was undoubtedly a synthesis of Chinese tradition and Western modernity created out of tension at all levels. At the personal level, however, the role Sun assumed was clearly decisive. For he alone was able to transform his personal tension into a source of creativity and did everything he could, under the circumstances, to “combine the best from China and the best from other countries,” as he said.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1145" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Unfortunately, Sun died with his revolution unfinished. His vision of a new China still remains to be fully realized. We know quite well what his vision is like in political, economic, and social terms. But how are we to translate his vision into cultural terms, particularly with respect to Chinese tradition? It is, of course, anybody’s guess. To conclude, however, let me borrow as a tentative answer Hu Shih’s (Hu Shi) view of Chinese tradition, which he reached toward the end of his life: “The product of this rebirth looks suspiciously occidental. But scratch its surface and you will find that the stuff of which it is made is essentially the Chinese bedrock which much weathering and corrosion only made stand out more clearly&mdash;the humanistic and rationalistic China resurrected by the touch of the scientific and democratic civilization of the new world.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2254" id="calibre_link-2336" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">82</a></small></sup></span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1242" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">S</span>ince the turn of the century, a radical mode of thinking has dominated the Chinese mind. The history of Chinese thought in the twentieth century may be interpreted as a process of rapid radicalization. As a matter of fact, never in its long intellectual tradition of over 2.5 millennia had China been as thoroughly radicalized as in modern times.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1317" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Radicalism in the Chinese intellectual tradition, however, has its limits. The critique developed within the tradition is essentially an internal one. Traditional critics in general and Confucians in particular have tended to take the Way (<i class="calibre9">Dao</i>) to be immanent in the world of everyday life. This is expressed in the opening statement of the Confucian classic, “Zhongyong” (The Doctrine of the Mean): “The Way cannot be separated from us for a moment. What can be separated is not the Way.” This would suggest that we have always lived in the Way. Yet on the other hand, the Way as transcendence must also be distinguished from the world of everyday life. Indeed, it would not be conceivable that the Way could have generated critical principles as it actually did without this transcendent dimension. However, it is an undeniably unique feature of the Way, not in the discovery or invention of an alternative Way. In his <i class="calibre9">Interpretation and Social Criticism</i>, Michael Walzer, of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, argues that since the moral world has long been in existence, neither discovery nor invention is necessary. It is rather in interpretation where the real possibility of social criticism lies. Moral principles and values are always unclear and uncertain in meaning; they require constant interpretation and reinterpretation on our part, particularly in times of crisis.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-419" id="calibre_link-462" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> Walzer’s emphasis on the importance of interpretation as a critical method fits in remarkably well with the Chinese critical tradition. But we must hasten to add that the very idea that an alternative Way can be discovered or invented to take the place of the one already in existence does not seem to have ever occurred to traditional Chinese critics.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Even popular radicalism in the Chinese tradition rarely, if ever, questioned the ultimate legitimacy of the Way. For example, the <i class="calibre9">Scripture of Great Peace</i> (Taipingjing <span>太</span><span>平</span><span>經</span>), a Daoist religious text datable to the second century, has been identified by many modern scholars as one of the earliest works containing “rebel ideologies.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-420" id="calibre_link-463" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> The text advocates radical reforms and attacks social and economic inequalities of its time. The critical method adopted in the text is clearly interpretation, however. By reinterpreting the Way in terms of Great Peace (or Great Equality), the author(s) of the text did not mean to demolish the Confucian order established since the beginning of the Han dynasty. On the contrary, there is every indication that the authors intended to cleanse the Way of its impurities. Little wonder that historians today, Marxist and non-Marxist alike, are often puzzled by the “Confucian model” they detect in the social structure represented in this text.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-421" id="calibre_link-464" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> Rebel ideologies of later ages, though sometimes inspired by religious ideas of non-Chinese origins, do not suggest an alternative social order substantially different from the traditional egalitarian model. In this respect, Chinese popular radicalism is probably not very dissimilar to its English counterpart as exemplified in London during the Restoration. There reformers “did not agitate merely to tear things down, but to restore to the community a customary order that the authorities themselves had allowed to come undone.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-422" id="calibre_link-465" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">REINTERPRETATION AND DISCOVERY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>With this traditional picture as a contrast, allow me to now move on to the modern era. Radicalization of the Chinese mind at the turn of the century began with a strategic move from “interpretation” to “discovery” on the part of the Chinese intellectual elite. At the end of the nineteenth century, Chinese critics discovered that there was a new and better Way in the West that could displace and replace the old Way, not unlike Plato’s philosopher who, having seen the sunlight, returned to the cave to tell his former fellow-prisoners what he discovered about truth. Antonio Gramsci, a leading Socialist theoretician, discussing the Russian Bolsheviks and their revolution, wrote:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1275" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>An elite consisting of some of the most active, energetic, enterprising and disciplined members of the society emigrates abroad and assimilates the culture and historical experiences of the most advanced countries of the West, without however losing the most essential characteristics of its own nationality, that is to say without breaking its sentimental and historical links with its own people. Having thus performed its intellectual apprenticeship it returns to its own country and compels the people to an enforced awakening, skipping historical stages in the process.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-423" id="calibre_link-466" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>This could be an equally accurate description of the Chinese intellectual elite in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, except that we must also include Japan among “the most advanced countries.” Yan Fu <span>嚴</span><span>復</span> (1854&ndash;1921) was among the earliest “returned students” who, through his interpretive translation of Thomas H. Huxley’s <i class="calibre9">Evolution and Ethics</i> and Herbert Spencer’s <i class="calibre9">A Study of Sociology</i>, galvanized a whole generation of Chinese intellectuals into a fury of reform-related activity. It must be emphatically noted that when he was working on the translation of <i class="calibre9">Evolution and Ethics</i> from 1895 to 1896, Yan Fu was the foremost radical thinker in China. Indeed, “Respect the people and rebel against the ruler; respect the present and rebel against antiquity” was the gospel he preached to everybody. Moreover, in a well-known essay, “Pi Han” (In Refutation of Han Yu, 1895), he dismissed as historically false the account of the origins of human culture given in Han Yu’s <span>韓</span><span>愈</span> “Yuandao” <span>原</span><span>道</span> (On the True Way). Throughout the essay, Yan Fu not only explicitly questioned the legitimacy of the Confucian political order but also implied that the democratic system practiced in the modern West is much closer to the true Way as envisioned by ancient Chinese sages. Thus, Yan Fu began the process of radicalization, marked by the transition from interpretation to discovery as a critical method.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>However, the transition was not easy. Generally speaking, from the 1890s to the Revolution of 1911, Chinese radicalism still took the form of interpretation, but it was, in fact, thinly disguised discovery. We can see clearly in the case of Yan Fu the earliest application of the method of discovery disguised as interpretation. He discovered in the West a much better alternative to the Confucian political order; he also discovered, much to his liking, social Darwinism and the ethic implicit in it. It is interesting to note that in his translator’s commentaries on Thomas H. Huxley, John Stuart Mill, and Montesquieu, he often made laudatory references to the classical Daoist texts, <i class="calibre9">Laozi</i> and <i class="calibre9">Zhuangzi</i>. In his commentaries on <i class="calibre9">Laozi</i> and <i class="calibre9">Zhuangzi</i>, he pointed out that Western ideas such as freedom, democracy, science, and evolution could be found in these two texts in their embryonic forms. Thus, following the Chinese commentarial tradition, Yan Fu appears to be merely reinterpreting the Chinese Way through a subtle shift in emphasis from Confucianism to Daoism. Nevertheless, as his “In Refutation of Han Yu” makes clear, he was actually advocating a radical change in China from an authoritarian political system to a democratic one.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-424" id="calibre_link-467" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1032" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>If Yan Fu tempered his early radicalism with evolutionary gradualism, Kang Youwei <span>康</span><span>有</span><span>為</span> (1858&ndash;1927) and Tan Sitong <span>譚</span><span>嗣</span><span>同</span> (1864&ndash;1898) boldly developed full-blown radicalism in modern China for the first time. Unlike Yan Fu, both Kang and Tan as political reformers pushed for not only “wholesale change” but “immediate change” as well. Of the two, Tan must be judged as the more radical because he was ready to break away from the Chinese tradition. There can be no doubt that both had been exposed to Western learning available in China before their reform program took its final shape. Current research shows that Kang Youwei’s theory of the three-stage social evolution, supposedly derived from his study of the <i class="calibre9">Gongyang zhuan</i> <span>公</span><span>羊</span><span>傳</span> (Gongyang Commentary) on the <i class="calibre9">Chunqiu</i> (Spring and Autumn Annals) of Confucius, was in part owed to Yan Fu’s social Darwinism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-425" id="calibre_link-468" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> At any rate, it is now common knowledge that their reform program was formulated with a Western model in the background. However, both still found it necessary to disguise discovery as interpretation. In the case of Kang, the disguise was more deceptive because his reinterpretation of Confucius as a reformer was inextricably entangled in a great variety of classical texts. By contrast, Tan did not pretend to build his radical vision on any particular classical text. Yet to the extent that he called his philosophical treatise <i class="calibre9">Renxue</i> <span>仁</span><span>學</span> (A study of humanity, 1896&ndash;1897), he was certainly making no claim to discovery. On the contrary, it suggests that he was merely trying to reinterpret the Confucian ideal of <i class="calibre9">ren</i>, even though his reinterpretation involved the idea of “ether” in nineteenth-century science. As the modern Chinese intellectual historian Chang Hao (Zhang Hao <span>張</span><span>灝</span>) says, “the impact of Tan’s discovery of the West was beyond gaining scientific knowledge.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-426" id="calibre_link-469" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> It is significant to note that the emphasis in <i class="calibre9">A Study of Humanity</i> is placed not on the discovery of the West but on the interpretation of the Confucian vision of humanity.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The last phase of discovery disguised as interpretation was well represented by the <i class="calibre9">Guocui</i> (National Essence) Movement organized around the journal <i class="calibre9">Guocui xuebao</i> <span>國</span><span>粹</span><span>學</span><span>報</span> (Journal of National Essence) (1905&ndash;1911). Major contributors to the journal included Zhang Binglin <span>章</span><span>炳</span><span>麟</span> (1869&ndash;1935), Liu Shipei <span>劉</span><span>師</span><span>培</span> (1884&ndash;1919), Huang Jie <span>黃</span><span>節</span> (1874&ndash;1935), Deng Shi <span>鄧</span><span>實</span>, (1877&ndash;1941), Chen Qubing <span>陳</span><span>去</span><span>病</span> (1874&ndash;1933), and Ma Xulun <span>馬</span><span>敘</span><span>倫</span> (1884&ndash;1970). It is rather ironic that since the May Fourth Period, the entire <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> group has been generally identified as cultural conservatives. In their own days, they were bona fide radical scholars. In their attitude toward the Confucian tradition, all were revolutionaries as opposed to the constitutionalists led by Kang Youwei or Tan Sitong. It was due to their efforts that an iconoclastic undercurrent in the history of Chinese thought was rediscovered. Anarchists of the Wei-Jin Period (220&ndash;419) such as Bao Jinyan and left-wingers of the Wang Yangming school like Li Zhi <span>李</span><span>贄</span> (1527&ndash;1602), for example, were restored to grace for the first time. In addition, several of the <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> scholars, notably Zhang Binglin and Liu Shipei, sojourned in Tokyo during the first decade of the twentieth century and, as a result, were exposed to a variety of Western ideas and theories through Japanese translation. They not only went much further to discover the West but also were often intensely excited about their new discoveries.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1147" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>If Yan Fu introduced Western ideas and theories to the Chinese reading public, <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> scholars set for themselves the central task of applying some of these ideas and theories to the study of the Chinese cultural heritage. As one of the editorial rules of the <i class="calibre9">Guocui xuebao</i> makes abundantly clear, “With regard to Western learning, we shall also elucidate all those new theories and special insights that prove to be capable of illuminating Chinese learning.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-427" id="calibre_link-470" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> It is undoubtedly true that the avowed purpose of the <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> movement was a quest for cultural identity in the face of the ever-growing Western influence. However, a general investigation of the writings of some of the leading <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> scholars will show, rather paradoxically, that what they identified as China’s “national essence” turned out to be, more often than not, basic cultural values of the West such as democracy, equality, liberty, and human rights. This identification was justified on either of the following grounds: First, as Huang Jie, an editor of the <i class="calibre9">Guocui xuebao</i> and a well-known classicist, put it, “<i class="calibre9">guocui</i> consists not only in what is indigenous and still suitable but also in what is borrowed but capable of being adapted to the needs of our nation.” Second, they took these Western values as universal and insisted on their genesis in an early China completely independent of the West. A large part of the <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> historiography deals with these themes.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-428" id="calibre_link-471" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> The theory of social evolution of the Spencerian variety together with its historical laws was now applied to interpret almost every aspect of Chinese history.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">RADICALISM</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Finally, during the May Fourth era beginning with the literary revolution in 1917, a paradigmatic change took place in the development of radicalism in modern China. From this time on, whether in criticizing the tradition or advocating changes, Chinese intellectuals would almost invariably invoke some Western ideas, values, or institutions as ultimate grounds for justification. It was now neither necessary nor possible to disguise discovery as interpretation.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The May Fourth Movement has been referred to by several other names, such as the “New Culture Movement,” the “Renaissance,” and the “Enlightenment.” Each name implies a particular historical interpretation regarding the nature and significance of the movement. The two Western terms, “Renaissance” and “Enlightenment,” require some observations. The application of these two Western historical terms to the May Fourth Movement is predicated on the assumption that the Chinese past can be reconstructed according to the historical model of the West. This assumption did not begin with the May Fourth era but is traceable to <i class="calibre9">Guocui</i> historiography as well as to Liang Qichao’s advocacy of New History. In the two essays on this topic, written in 1901 and 1902, Liang not only adopted the European scheme of periodization (ancient, medieval, and modern) as the model of universal validity but also accepted the Spencerian theory of social evolution as a self-evident truth.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-429" id="calibre_link-472" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1003" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In recent years, however, it seems quite popular, in China as well as in the West, to interpret the May Fourth Movement as the Chinese Enlightenment.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-430" id="calibre_link-473" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> I accept the term “enlightenment,” but only in a symbolic sense, not as a historical analogy. As mentioned earlier, the discovery of the West by modern Chinese critics reminds us of Plato’s philosopher who returns to his cave after having discovered the sunlight in the outside world. This Platonic symbolism is particularly appropriate for the “returned” Chinese intellectuals of the May Fourth generation. So, too, is Gramsci’s characterization of the Russian elite, as well as the following case about Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span>, a famous intellectual in the May Fourth Movement. In 1916, Hu Shi wrote a self-congratulatory poem in classical style on his birthday. In it, he said that he dreamed that he made a trip to Heaven as an “immortal” where he discovered a few “magical drugs” unknown to other “immortals.” He intended to return to the human world and use them to cure diseases. Obviously, his “Heaven” is America and his “human world” is China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-431" id="calibre_link-474" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> On March 8, 1917, just months away from his journey home, Hu Shi read a book about the Oxford Movement and was deeply touched by a John Henry Newman quotation, supposedly from the <i class="calibre9">Iliad</i>: “You shall know the difference now that we are back again.” At the end of the entry in his diary, he remarked: “This sets the precedent for us returned-students.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-432" id="calibre_link-475" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> Like the Russian elite in Gramsci’s description, Hu Shi did not break his “sentimental and historical links with his own people.” He returned to China and compelled the people to an “enforced awakening.” For good or for bad, he did make a difference.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>When Hu Shi arrived in Shanghai in July 1917, he found to his dismay that his motherland was almost exactly the same as he had left it in 1910. However, China had not come to a standstill during his absence. He had left an imperial China and had returned to a republican one. A new storm of radicalization was gathering. His explosive article on literary revolution, with a follow-up one by chief editor Chen Duxiu <span>陳</span><span>獨</span><span>秀</span> (1879&ndash;1942), had appeared in the <i class="calibre9">New Youth</i> magazine early in the year. Yet it would be unfair to blame this new wave of radicalism, especially in its total rejection of tradition, on a few May Fourth leaders, including Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu. Contempt for tradition, a built-in feature of radicalism, had well begun with some of the <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> scholars. It continued to grow after the Revolution of 1911, as R. F. Johnston, the British teacher of the last emperor of China, observed: “It is a bewildering phenomenon…that just when we Europeans were realizing with amazement the high value of China’s social and political philosophy, her ethics, her art and literature, the Chinese themselves were learning to treat these great products of her own civilization with impatient contempt.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-433" id="calibre_link-476" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> We can ignore the European part of Johnston’s statement, but the Chinese part must be accepted as an eyewitness account of the Chinese mentality that made the May Fourth Movement possible.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1201" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Since the end of the nineteenth century, radicalization of the Chinese mind proceeded at an astonishingly accelerated speed. When Hu Shi returned to China in 1917, most of the major radical thinkers of the earlier generations were still alive, and some were still politically and intellectually active. These included Yan Fu, Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, Zhang Binglin, and Liu Shipei, but in the eyes of Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu, not to mention the younger generation, they were already men of the past. All were conservatives; some were even reactionaries. How could this possibly be the case? It becomes ever more puzzling if we consider the fact that by Hu Shi’s own admission, China did not make much progress between 1910 and 1917. Ordinarily when we judge someone as either ahead of or behind his time, our frame of reference is the status quo, or what the German sociologist Karl Mannheim calls “the existing framework of life.” With reference to the status quo in China on the eve of the May Fourth Movement, none of the above thinkers can be summarily dismissed as intellectually out-of-date. However, this puzzle disappears once we realize that while intellectuals of the May Fourth generation regarded these early radical leaders as outdated, their frame of reference was not the status quo in China but some new truths they had recently discovered in the outside world, especially in the West. In this way, radical ideas in China rose and fell in quick succession according, by and large, to the inner logic of the world of thought and were virtually unrelated to the realities of society.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-434" id="calibre_link-477" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In <i class="calibre9">The Conservative Mind from Burke to Eliot</i>, the American critic Russell Kirk points out that since 1790 at least five major schools of radical thought have emerged. They are the rationalism of the <i class="calibre9">philosophes</i>, the romantic emancipation of Rousseau and his allies, the utilitarianism of the Benthamites, the positivism of Comte’s school, and the collectivistic materialism of Marx and other socialists. In addition, Kirk also mentions Darwinism as a force that has done much to undermine the first principles of a conservative order.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-435" id="calibre_link-478" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> It is extraordinary that practically all these major schools of radical thought, as well as others, which have taken the West almost two centuries to absorb and digest, arrived in China within a short span of three or four decades. From hindsight, twentieth-century China has been so inundated with radicalisms from the West that thorough and rapid radicalization was hardly avoidable.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Mao Zedong <span>毛</span><span>澤</span><span>東</span> (1893&ndash;1976) once characterized the intellectual climate of modern China as a “search for truth from the West.” There has been more or less a consensus among historians that a profound sense of the crisis of national survival on the part of Chinese intellectuals was initially responsible for setting in motion this “search.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1368" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It is neither possible nor necessary here to examine every imported idea that helped to radicalize the Chinese mentality. For illustration, let us take only one or two examples. The idea of total demolition of tradition as a precondition for the building of a new society was wholly inconceivable to the traditional Chinese imagination, but it was one of the absolute presuppositions of the May Fourth iconoclastic antitraditionalism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-436" id="calibre_link-479" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> Many radical ideas undoubtedly helped, but perhaps none more effectively than the Enlightenment notion of rationality and modernity, as Stephen Toulmin, a philosopher at Northwestern University, explains: “The belief that any new construction is truly <i class="calibre9">rational</i> only if it demolishes all that was there before and starts from scratch, has played a particular part in the intellectual and political history of France…but no one who enters the spirit of Modernity whole-heartedly can be immune to its influence. The most spectacular illustration of this is the French Revolution.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-437" id="calibre_link-480" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> May Fourth intellectuals’ early conversion to Marxism was certainly made much easier by their deep faith in “science” in its extreme positivistic sense. The very term “scientific socialism” carried with it a weight of authority that must have crushed many resisting wills. In this connection, mention may also be made of the enormous and long-enduring influence of social Darwinism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-438" id="calibre_link-481" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> This paved the way for the May Fourth intellectuals to wholeheartedly accept the Marxist iron law of social evolution as self-evident truth.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>However, not all the May Fourth intellectual leaders were radicals. Hu Shi, for example, must be recognized as a moderate liberal even though he did have his radical moments. Since radicalization sped up immeasurably after the May Fourth Movement of 1919, Hu Shi was soon to be dismissed as a conservative or, worse still, as a “counterrevolutionary” by radical Marxists and other revolutionaries. It is amazing that only one year after the May Fourth incident, Chen Duxiu was already converted to Marxism. Hu Shi’s debate with the other May Fourth leader, Li Dazhao <span>李</span><span>大</span><span>釗</span> (1888&ndash;1927), over “Problems Versus Isms” (whether piecemeal solutions to concrete problems or holistic ideological choices ought to be the central concerns of the intellectuals) broke out as early as July or August 1919.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-439" id="calibre_link-482" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> It was the first ideological confrontation between liberalism and Marxism, and it signaled the beginning of the final, highest stage of radicalization in twentieth-century China.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1128" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>There can be no doubt that May Fourth Marxist radicals were always inclined to transform China totally by recourse to what Karl Mannheim calls a “systematic possibility,” meaning that to deal with a single undesirable social fact, the whole system of society in which such a fact is possible ought to be transformed.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-440" id="calibre_link-483" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> However, as their pursuit of the possible was always made in the abstract as opposed to the concrete, the possibility became forever out of reach. Scientific socialism turned out to be more utopian than utopian socialism. Moreover, from the very beginning, Chinese Marxism was cast in the negative mold of May Fourth iconoclastic antitraditionalism. Thus, it generated a radicalism of a highly destructive nature. I would like to suggest that Mao Zedong may well be interpreted as Chinese Marxist radicalism incarnate. He was a genius in destruction but wholly incapable of constructive work. Throughout his life he was in constant pursuit of an abstract possibility and unable to settle with anything concrete. In the 1940s, he designed a new democracy apparently in concrete terms, but never intended to put it into practice. He was the founding father of the People’s Republic of China, yet his dissatisfaction with it was so deep that he never ceased to attack it by launching one campaign after another until his death. His destructive work culminated in the Cultural Revolution. It seems as if he deliberately worked against the actualization of the very possibility he himself had always pursued.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>It is sometimes said that ideas have lives of their own, but this is no more than a metaphor. In reality, it is the holders of ideas, especially the intellectuals, who give them lives. In order to understand why China since the turn of the century has been radicalized, I must now move from phenomenology of mind to sociology of knowledge.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Radicalization of the Chinese mind is an immensely complex topic deserving of a much fuller treatment. I would venture to suggest, however, that it grew first and foremost out of two interrelated historical developments that may be called, respectively, the marginalization of China in the world and the marginalization of intellectuals in Chinese society. I shall try to explain how this double marginalization helped to trigger the long process of radicalization in modern China.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1149" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>By marginalization of China in the world I refer not to the historical reality itself, but the perception of it on the part of Chinese intellectuals. In reality, the replacement of the tributary system by the treaty system in the 1840s already marked the beginning of the end of the traditional Sinocentric world order. Their immediate response to the humiliating treaty of Nanjing of 1842 was rather a traditional one. Limited by experiences of barbarian invasions in the past, they interpreted China’s defeat mainly in terms of the technological superiority of the West. It did not occur to them that the Chinese political and social order as a whole was no longer adequate to cope with a barbarian threat of an altogether different nature. Discussing China’s foreign policy toward the West in 1842, the reform-minded scholar Wei Yuan <span>魏</span><span>源</span> (1794&ndash;1856) came to the conclusion that the only way for China to control the barbarians would be to resolve to learn their superior techniques: warships, firearms, and methods of training soldiers.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-441" id="calibre_link-484" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> On the other hand, his reformism was still very much in the Confucian <i class="calibre9">jingshi</i> tradition, showing not even the slightest trace of any Western influence. Two decades later, the prophetic reformer Feng Guifen was among the earliest Chinese intellectuals to recognize the importance of Western learning to China’s survival in the modern world. In his influential essay, “On the Adoption of Western Learning” (Cai Xixue yi, written in 1862), he advanced beyond Wei Yuan by pointing out that to learn the superior techniques of the barbarians, China must first grasp the fundamentals of Western learning, including mathematics, mechanics, optics, light, chemistry, and other branches of the natural sciences. His faith in the traditional political and social order, however, remained unshaken; Chinese ethics and Confucian teachings, he insisted, must continue to serve as the original foundation.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-442" id="calibre_link-485" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> The prominent scholar-official Zhang Zhidong’s famous saying, “Chinese learning for fundamental principles, Western learning for practical application” (1898), was clearly a crystallization of the ideas originally developed in Feng Guifen’s writings.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-443" id="calibre_link-486" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In 1894&ndash;1895, Chinese intellectuals discovered for the first time the shocking truth about China being marginalized. Culturally, Japan had been borrowing from China since the Tang dynasty (618&ndash;907), if not earlier. In the eyes of many nineteenth-century Chinese intellectuals, Japan was one of China’s cultural satellites in the East Asian world. When a Chinese scholar was told in the early 1870s that Japan had recently turned away from Chinese civilization and had begun to transform itself on the Western model, ranging from legal institutions to social customs, he became so upset as to compare the Meiji Emperor to the First Emperor of Qin who “committed books to flames and swept away all the Confucians.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-444" id="calibre_link-487" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> Needless to say, no one in China could have possibly foreseen that precisely because of its success in Westernization, Japan was able to defeat China decisively in the war of 1894&ndash;1895.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Criticizing the anachronism of the Sinocentric self-conception of the Chinese (<i class="calibre9">tianxia</i>, meaning “all under Heaven”), the eminent translator of Chinese classics, James Legge, made the following remarks in 1872:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>During the past forty years her (i.e., China’s) position with regard to the more advanced nations of the world has entirely changed. She has entered into treaties with them upon equal terms; but I do not think her ministers and people have yet looked the truth fairly in the face, so as to realize the fact that China is only one of many independent nations in the world, and that the “beneath the sky,” over which her emperor has ruled, is not <i class="calibre9">all</i> beneath the sky, but only a certain portion of it which is defined on the earth’s surface and can be pointed out upon the map. But if they will not admit this, and strictly keep good faith according to the treaties which they have accepted, the result will be for them calamities greater than any that have yet befallen the empire.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-445" id="calibre_link-488" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Legge’s observation was not only accurate but startlingly prophetic. China’s first war with Japan was a calamity. Even though by the 1890s, Chinese ministers and the general populace no longer considered China as “all beneath the sky” vis-<span>à</span>-vis the West, they nevertheless continued to regard Japan with traditional arrogance. This is evident in the views expressed by advocates of war in the court as well as among the intellectuals during the period from 1894 to 1895. China may well have become only one of many nations in the world, but its central position in East Asia was not open to challenge, especially from one of its cultural satellites. It is not without symbolic meaning that the war was fought, at least ostensibly, on account of China’s claim of suzerainty over Korea, a claim that Japan refused to recognize.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1307" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>From the above discussion, it seems safe to say that as far as its perception was concerned, the marginalization of China did not fully manifest itself until the end of the first Sino-Japanese war. It was a catastrophe of this magnitude that finally awakened Chinese intellectuals to the painful truth that China had been marginalized not only in the world but in East Asia as well. As the Rutgers historian Michael Gasster pointed out in his study of the origins of modern Chinese radicalism, “After 1894&ndash;1895, the even more astonishing humiliation dealt to China by her hitherto lightly regarded neighbor, Japan, had almost immediate consequences in domestic politics and the intellectual world, as evidenced by the activities and ideas of Kang Youwei, Yan Fu, and Sun Yat-sen.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-446" id="calibre_link-489" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> The discovery of the marginalization of China led immediately to the radicalization of the Chinese mind. Within two weeks of the conclusion of the Treaty of Shimonoseki (April 17, 1895), ending the war, Kang Youwei was joined by more than 1,200 examination candidates in Peking to present the famous “Ten Thousand Word Memorial” to the throne advocating comprehensive institutional reforms. Yan Fu’s translation of <i class="calibre9">Evolution and Ethics</i> and Tan Sitong’s <i class="calibre9">A Study of Humanity</i> were both a psychological aftermath of the war. Psychologically speaking, Liang Qichao was not exaggerating when he said that the war of 1894&ndash;1895 “awakened China from a slumber of four thousand years.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-447" id="calibre_link-490" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup> Never before had the Chinese intellectual world been radicalized on such an enormous scale and within such a short time.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>From an exclusively political point of view, the post-1895 radicalization resulted directly from the intellectuals’ sudden awareness of the crisis of national survival. There can be no question that the immediate goal of both Kang Youwei’s reform movement and Sun Yat-sen’s more radical program of revolution was to “Save China” (<i class="calibre9">jiuguo</i> <span>救</span><span>國</span>) from being conquered by imperialist powers.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In culture, as in politics, the Middle Kingdom complex has been constantly at work since the end of the nineteenth century.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-448" id="calibre_link-491" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> When Chinese intellectuals discovered the unpleasant truth about China being marginalized politically as well as culturally, they immediately confronted the difficult task of how to open China to Western influence without at the same time relinquishing its millennia-old status as a center of culture. The history of this bizarre intellectual enterprise can be divided into two distinct periods, corresponding exactly to “discovery disguised as interpretation” and “discovery undisguised.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1131" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>During the period of discovery disguised as interpretation, the general strategy adopted by Chinese intellectuals was to interpret those Western ideas, values, and institutions particularly suited to the needs of China’s modernization as long as they were discovered by ancient Chinese sages independently of the West. We can easily see where the ingenuity of this strategy lies: to the extent that it advocated changes to the Western model, its main thrust was clearly radical, not conservative; however, to the extent that it disguised “discovery” as “interpretation,” the purpose of retaining China’s status as a center of culture was also well served. For example, the theory of Chinese origins of Western learning meant that Western sciences, technologies, music, the parliamentary system, economies, religion (Christianity), and law all had originated in classical China and somehow found their way to Europe. In this case, two points particularly deserve attention. First, although this theory had its early sporadic beginnings in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it gained sudden but wide popularity from 1895 to 1900. Second, during these few years, the theory was elaborately developed by scholars who were eagerly receptive rather than resistant to Western learning.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-449" id="calibre_link-492" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup> As a cultural phenomenon, this lends considerable support to our observation that since the end of the Sino-Japanese war, the change-oriented mentality of Chinese intellectuals has been shaped, at the psychological level, by their discovery of the truth about China being marginalized to the periphery of human culture. The theory of “Chinese origins of Western learning” came into vogue at the beginning stage of radicalization perhaps because it functioned as a safe conduit to Chinese intellectuals, assuring them, as it were, that to learn from the West was also the way to bring China back to the center.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1014" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>My second example is the theory of the Western origin of the Chinese race proposed by the French scholar Terrien de LaCouperie (1844&ndash;1894) in the late 1880s. Based on a highly dubious interpretation of Chinese etymology, he suggested that the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi <span>黃</span><span>帝</span>), supposedly the father of the Chinese race, was actually the generic title of the kings of Susiana (Nakhunti). According to this theory, the Yellow Emperor led a group of Chaldeans known as “Baks” from Mesopotamia to Central Asia and finally reached China in the third millennium <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> Under the leadership of the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi or Nakhunti), the Baks eventually defeated the natives and conquered China. The Baks, whom LaCouperie identified as the ruling aristocracy known as <i class="calibre9">Baixing</i> <span>百</span><span>姓</span> (Hundred Surnames) in early Confucian texts, created the earliest civilization in China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-450" id="calibre_link-493" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> This theory is pure fantasy, unworthy of even refutation. What is amazing about it, however, is the fact that in the first decade of the twentieth century, practically all Chinese historians of the <i class="calibre9">Guocui</i> school, including Huang Jie, Zhang Binglin, and Liu Shipei accepted this theory without showing a slightest sense of embarrassment. In his foreword to the inaugural issue of the <i class="calibre9">Guocui xuebao</i>, Huang Jie repeatedly referred to the Han Chinese as “we, the race of the Baks.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-451" id="calibre_link-494" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup> Zhang Binglin asserted not only that the Chinese race came from Chaldea but that China in high antiquity also shared many cultural traits with the Greeks, Romans, Saxons, Franks, and Slavs.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-452" id="calibre_link-495" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup> Liu Shipei was even more explicit. He speculated that the Han Chinese and the Caucasians were originally of the same race but later migrated to China and Europe, respectively, as a result of a population explosion.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-453" id="calibre_link-496" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup> One cannot help wonder how such critical and learned scholars could possibly be so credulous and absurd. What mattered here was not historical scholarship but cultural psychology. Like the theory of the Chinese origin of Western learning, it happened to meet the deep psychological needs of Chinese revolutionary intellectuals at this particular juncture in history. On the one hand, as anti-Manchu revolutionaries, they wanted to distance themselves from the ruling ethnic group (Manchus) as far as possible, historically as well as culturally. On the other hand, as cultural radicals, they took Western values as universal values and insisted on their genesis in early historic China. By invoking the theory of the Western origin of the Chinese race, they could thus conveniently kill two birds with one stone. Moreover, as historians, they wanted Chinese history to retain its central place in world history, as in the past. If the Chinese race were of Western origin, then China would still be seen as being at the very center of the West-dominated modern world, not on the periphery.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>With the paradigmatic shift from interpretation to discovery, radicalization began to take a wholly new shape and relate to China’s marginalization in a very different way. By the 1910s, as Chinese intellectuals had been increasingly gaining direct access to the West, the old strategy to defend the centrality of Chinese culture vis-<span>à</span>-vis the Western hegemony totally collapsed. Neither the theory of Chinese origins of Western learning nor the identification of values and ideas dominant in the modern West as China’s national essence was acceptable to a new generation of intellectuals who came of age in the early years of the Republic. As Hu Shi wrote in the introduction of his doctoral dissertation in 1917:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>How can we Chinese feel at ease in this new world which at first sight appears to be so much at variance with what we have long regarded as our own civilization? For it is perfectly natural and justifiable that a nation with a glorious past and a distinctive civilization of its own making should never feel quite at home in a new civilization, if that new civilization is looked upon as part and parcel imported from alien lands and forced upon it by external necessities of natural existence. And it would surely be a great loss to mankind at large if the acceptance of this new civilization should take the form of abrupt displacement instead of organic assimilation, thereby causing the disappearance of the old civilization. The real problem, therefore, may be restated thus: How can we best assimilate modern civilization in such a manner as to make it congenial and congruous and continuous with the civilization of our own making?<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-454" id="calibre_link-497" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1136" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Hu Shi’s theory sheds new light on the radicalization and marginalization of China. It is then its oldness, not Chineseness, that must be held accountable for the marginalization of Chinese culture to the periphery in the modern world. The real trouble with China was that due to her long isolation from the outside world, she had lagged behind the West in social evolution. Since Hu Shi regarded the universal and modern aspects of what he calls the “new civilization” of primary importance and its Westernness as secondary, he could, therefore, advocate China’s “complete acceptance of the civilization of the new world” without being troubled by the inferiority complex that had haunted Chinese intellectuals of earlier generations. This also explains why he later preferred “modernization” or “cosmopolitanization” to “Westernization” as descriptive terms for China’s cultural borrowings from the West. In 1917, Hu Shi heralded a new approach to cope with China’s marginalization, and along with it, a new way to radicalize.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>From 1917 onward, efforts to repossess the center of culture for China on the part of Chinese intellectuals generally take the form of incessantly seeking to import the latest products in the cultural market from the West. As a result, a new frame of mind has been formed among the Chinese intellectual elite that may be called the neoterist mentality, a mentality obsessed with change, with what is new. This mentality is best described in the vivid words of the British political philosopher Michael Oakeshott: “We are willing to try anything once, regardless of the consequences. One activity vies with another in being ‘up-to-date’: discarded motor-cars and television sets have their counterparts in discarded moral and religious beliefs: the eye is never on the new model.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-455" id="calibre_link-498" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup> Since the radical would be nothing if not also a neoterist, China’s marginalization and radicalization have thus grown, reinforcing each other at every turn. The tremendous overflow of radical ideas from the West and their rise and fall in quick succession in post-May Fourth China must be understood in this light.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As radicalization eventually led China to totalitarianism in 1949, the flow of ideas from the West came to an abrupt stop. However, China’s drive toward the center of the world, recently intensified by revolutionary violence, continued to run its course. This is demonstrated in the so-called Great Leap Forward Movement of 1958&ndash;1960 launched personally by Mao. On the one hand, with iron and steel production, he announced that China would catch up with Britain in fifteen years and, on the other hand, with the “people’s commune,” he was very proud of the fact that China had actually beat the Soviet Union by entering into the Communist stage first.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-456" id="calibre_link-499" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup> Since he believed that spiritual regeneration must take precedence over economic development, he sensed no contradiction at all to say that a country still fifteen years behind Britain in production had already won the political contest against the Soviet Union. To a considerable extent, it was also the same belief in the unfathomable power of the human spirit and will, especially his own, that drove him to the peak of a lifelong radicalism&mdash;the so-called Cultural Revolution.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">FROM THE CENTER TO THE PERIPHERY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1287" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Radicalization can be examined from a sociological point of view by linking it to the fact that the Chinese intelligentsia has been ever-increasingly marginalized from the center to the periphery in society since the end of the nineteenth century. This does not suggest, however, that the social marginalization of the Chinese intellectual began with the arrival of Western imperialism. As a matter of fact, historically, the decline of the social position of the <i class="calibre9">shi</i> <span>士</span> (scholar) vis-<span>à</span>-vis the merchant had been going on slowly but steadily since the sixteenth century, if not earlier. As noted by the early nineteenth-century scholar Shen Yao <span>沈</span><span>垚</span> (1798&ndash;1840), “While in the old days, sons of scholars forever remained as scholars, in later times, only sons of merchants could become scholars…. China’s center of gravity has tilted toward commerce, and consequently, heroes and men of intelligence mostly belong to the merchant class.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-457" id="calibre_link-500" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup> However, this process of social change suddenly accelerated toward the end of the century as the total collapse of the imperial system was drawing near. As a result, “China’s center of gravity” moved further away from the <i class="calibre9">shi</i>, who, according to the old Chinese system of social stratification, headed the list of the <i class="calibre9">simin</i> <span>四</span><span>民</span> (four major functional orders), the other three being <i class="calibre9">nong</i> <span>農</span> (farmers), <i class="calibre9">jiang</i> <span>匠</span>, (artisans and craftsmen), and <i class="calibre9">shang</i> <span>商</span> (merchants and tradesmen).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As far as its bearing on radicalization was concerned, the social marginalization of the Chinese intellectual also reached a turning point in the early years of the twentieth century when the traditional <i class="calibre9">shi</i> was being rapidly transformed into what we now call <i class="calibre9">zhishi fenzi</i> <span>知</span><span>識</span><span>份</span><span>子</span> (intellectual). This transformation, ironically, went hand in hand with the educational reform that had been carried out with ever-increasing speed after the first Sino-Japanese war. From 1895 to the end of the Qing dynasty in 1911, new schools of various levels based on Western and Japanese models grew all over China. In the meantime, it also suddenly became fashionable for students to go abroad for education, especially to Japan. The net result of these developments was the replacement of the state examination system by a modern school system. When the examination system was finally abolished in 1905, a long Chinese tradition in education and learning that had produced the <i class="calibre9">shi</i> since 622 without interruption was brought to an end. Therefore, symbolically, the year 1905 serves well as a dividing line between the traditional “scholar” and the modern “intellectual.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>There are, however, as many continuities as discontinuities between the traditional <i class="calibre9">shi</i> and the modern <i class="calibre9">zhishi fenzi</i>. In one area of vital importance, however, the modern “intellectual” must be clearly distinguished from the traditional “scholar.” The former is no longer directly linked to state power as the latter certainly was. Around the time of the abolition of the examination system, according to a rough official estimate, China had tens of thousands of <i class="calibre9">juren</i> <span>舉</span><span>人</span>, the intermediate degree, and several hundreds of thousands of <i class="calibre9">shengyuan</i> <span>生</span><span>員</span>, the lowest degree holders, who were eager to improve their social status by earning the prestigious <i class="calibre9">juren</i> and <i class="calibre9">jinshi</i> <span>進</span><span>士</span> degrees.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-458" id="calibre_link-501" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup> To these numbers, we must also add millions of degree aspirants who, having toiled for years in preparation, were ready to climb the ladder of success. Now, all of a sudden the ladder was pulled away and they were thus deprived of the traditional status as <i class="calibre9">shi</i> that had made them an integral part of the ruling apparatus in late imperial China. This may well have been one of the unintended consequences of the educational reform of the Qing court.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1360" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As the traditional <i class="calibre9">shi</i> turned into the modern <i class="calibre9">zhishi fenzi</i>, Chinese intellectuals also became politically marginalized in the sense that they now stood on the periphery of state power. Unlike <i class="calibre9">jinshi</i> or <i class="calibre9">juren</i> degrees, diplomas from new schools, or even higher degrees from foreign colleges and universities, did not automatically entitle their holders to state employments. As a result, modern intellectuals have been more readily susceptible to radicalization than the traditional <i class="calibre9">shi</i>. Captain James H. Reeves, the United States military attaché in Peking, made the following observation in 1912:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The revolution has been largely effected through the work of Chinese who have gone to school in Japan during the last ten to fifteen years…. During the past few years, the remark has been heard on all sides that the returned Japanese students [i.e., those Chinese who had returned from Japan] were revolutionary in spirit…. [They] returned to China republicans rather than monarchical reformers.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-459" id="calibre_link-502" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>At the same time, attention must also be called to the fact that in the imperial past, some <i class="calibre9">shi</i> turned into rebels only when they had repeatedly failed in examinations. (Hong Xiuchuan, the leader of the Taiping Rebellion, is one example.)</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Discussing the interests of Asian intellectuals, Max Weber once characterized the Chinese <i class="calibre9">shi</i> (whom he called “the Confucians”) as “aesthetically cultivated <i class="calibre9">literati</i> and polished salon conversationalists rather than politicians.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-460" id="calibre_link-503" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup> Generally speaking, this is true, but we must hasten to add that the <i class="calibre9">shi</i> could also be highly politicized and radicalized in times of sustained national crisis, as amply illustrated by the student movements under the Han and Song dynasties, the political protest of the Donglin scholars in the late Ming dynasty, and the joint petition for reform by Kang Youwei and 1,200 examination candidates in 1895. However, political radicalization of the <i class="calibre9">shi</i> had its prescribed limits. It was often expressed by way of internal criticism aimed primarily at restoration or modification of the imperial order; it did not question the legitimacy of the order itself. It invariably took the form of remonstrance or petition to the throne as if in the spirit of loyal opposition.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>With the advent of the modern <i class="calibre9">zhishi fenzi</i>, the situation has been fundamentally altered. Marginalized to the periphery, they generally refuse to identify themselves with the political establishment against which they protest. Comparing Kang Youwei’s petition to the emperor in 1895 to the student movement of May Fourth will make this point clear. It may be argued that Kang’s movement is midway between tradition and modernity. The May Fourth Movement is a decidedly modern political action appealing to the patriotic feelings of the masses rather than petitioning to the government. To a considerable degree, this radical mode of Chinese intellectuals can also be understood in terms of marginalization. Under a government dominated by warlords, intellectuals had no legitimate ways of seeking public office except, perhaps, through personal ties.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1296" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As in the case of China’s marginalization, we can also conveniently divide the marginalization of intellectuals in Chinese society into two distinct periods with the abolition of the examination in 1905 as a symbolic though imprecise milepost. In the decade of 1895&ndash;1905, the last generation of <i class="calibre9">shi</i> still stood inside the power structure of the imperial state, even though they were considerably marginalized to the periphery. Nevertheless, the <i class="calibre9">shi</i> in the last years of imperial China continued to recognize, though not entirely without reluctance, the legitimacy of the Confucian order. They disguised discovery as interpretation and advocated changes within the limit of monarchical reform. By contrast, modern intellectuals, especially since 1905, stood outside the center of the imperial power. Armed with ideas imported from the West, they openly questioned the raison d’être of the imperial system.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-461" id="calibre_link-504" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">43</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As much as I would like to distinguish the <i class="calibre9">shi</i> from the <i class="calibre9">zhishi fenzi</i>, I must point out that spiritually, the latter has continued much of what had been cultivated by the former. For example, the idea that the intellectual must always be identified with public-mindedness is not a cultural borrowing from the modern West, but from Confucian heritage traceable ultimately to the sage himself. At any rate, the two most famous mottoes of the Confucian scholar and statesman, Fan Zhongyan <span>范</span><span>仲</span><span>淹</span> (989&ndash;1052), are still very much alive in the mind of practically every educated person in China, even to this day: “The <i class="calibre9">shi</i> must take the whole world as his own responsibility”; “The <i class="calibre9">shi</i> is one who ought to be the first to worry about the troubles of the world but last to enjoy its pleasures.” It was with this spirit that numerous modern intellectuals had plunged themselves into revolution after revolution until, more often than not, they were totally consumed by its flame. The real tragedy in the history of Chinese revolutions is that it was always the radicalized Chinese intellectuals who imported and sowed the seeds of revolution while the harvest was, without exception, reaped by those anti-intellectual elements who knew best how to manipulate the revolution to seize its power. For the intellectuals, the seeds of revolution turned out to be seeds of their own destruction.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">CONCLUSION</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1374" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This essay attempts to do two things. First, it aims to delineate the Chinese mind in the twentieth century primarily in terms of a process of radicalization. Attention is particularly drawn to the distinctive shape this radicalization takes, and the unique way in which it takes form. This is still very much an ongoing process in China today; a review of the past may therefore throw some light on the present. Second, radicalization is linked directly to the marginalization of China in the modern world and the marginalization of intellectuals in Chinese society. While some may link the first marginalization with the Middle Kingdom complex or simply nationalism, I consider “Middle Kingdom” too political and “nationalism” too general to serve my purposes. For Chinese intellectuals, the overriding concern has been to keep China from losing its status as a center of culture. Needless to say, this double marginalization does not wholly explain radicalization in twentieth-century China. It has been singled out because it seems to hold a key for unlocking one of the doors of the twentieth-century Chinese mind.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Radicalization is only one among the many faces of modern China. The term must not be taken to suggest that Chinese intellectuals at all levels have been radicalized since the turn of the century or the rise of the May Fourth Movement. In conclusion, if I may be permitted to indulge in a personal note, I also come from Anhui, the native province of both Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi, and during the second Sino-Japanese war, I lived in a small village about sixty to seventy miles away from Chen’s birthplace (Huaining) for eight years (1937&ndash;1945). I heard of Chen’s name only once when he was accused, falsely, as I later learned, of having changed the old Confucian dictum into “filial piety is the first of all evils and adultery the first of all virtues.” I also spent a year (1945&ndash;1946) in the neighboring county, Tongcheng, whose literary school had been singled out for abuse by the May Fourth leaders of new literature, especially Qian Xuantong <span>錢</span><span>玄</span><span>同</span> (1887&ndash;1939). But there I was still encouraged to write poetry in the classical style. It was only after I returned to the big cities such as Nanking, Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenyang in 1946 that I began to be exposed to the influence of radical ideas of Western origin. In those postwar years (1946&ndash;1949), as far as I can recall, neither Marxism nor iconoclastic antitraditionalism dominated the daily life of ordinary urban intellectuals. Consequently, I have often been puzzled by the question as to how widespread and penetrating the May Fourth Movement or Marxism really was prior to 1949 in China as a whole.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If, however, we look at the campuses of major universities in post&ndash;May Fourth China, we see an entirely new face. The inevitable conclusion is that although radicalization may have been confined only to scattered centers in a vast China, it did occur where it mattered most, both intellectually and politically.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1004" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">I</span>n recent years, the May Fourth Movement has generally been identified as the Chinese Enlightenment. When Chinese authors first gave the movement this new identity in the late 1930s and early 1940s, it was clearly intended as a tribute of the highest possible order by way of analogy. Now that the twentieth century is over, however, the honor originally implied in that identity is fast becoming a dubious one. Indeed, now the dark side of the Enlightenment project centering on the idea of rationality is often perceived as a “failure,” or even worse, as a form of “domination.” It is therefore only natural that the postmodern rage against Enlightenment rationality is also beginning to cast a shadow on the May Fourth project.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>I shall return to the question of the Enlightenment below. Right now I consider it important to call attention to the fact that before the identity of the Enlightenment was established, the May Fourth Movement had been more widely known in the West as the “Chinese Renaissance.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1642" id="calibre_link-1706" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> To begin with, I propose to explore the historical implications of each of these analogical concepts as well as explain why eventually, “Renaissance” gave way to “Enlightenment.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1386" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>More than anyone else, Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962) was responsible for propagating the idea of the “Chinese Renaissance” in the West. While on a lecture tour in Great Britain in November 1926, he lectured on the “Chinese Renaissance” repeatedly in academic institutions such as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Trinity College (Dublin), Oxford University, the University of Liverpool, and Woodbrooke Settlement.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1643" id="calibre_link-1707" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> One of the lecture posters even introduced him as “The Father of the Chinese Renaissance.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1644" id="calibre_link-1708" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> When he arrived in New York in January 1927, the New York-based magazine <i class="calibre9">The Nation</i> reported: “Hu Shih has returned to the United States…. Boldly advocating the use of a despised vernacular tongue, he did for Chinese what Dante and Petrarch had done for Italians: he opened the doors of literacy to millions who could never have mastered the intricacies of the involved classic tongue.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1645" id="calibre_link-1709" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup> This is simply another way of identifying him as the “Father of the Chinese Renaissance.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In one of his Haskell Lectures at the University of Chicago in 1933, Hu Shi explained in no uncertain terms what he meant by the notion of “Chinese Renaissance”:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><i class="calibre9">The Renaissance</i> was the name given by a group of Peking University students to a new monthly magazine which they published in 1918. They were mature students well trained in the old cultural tradition of the country, and they readily recognized in the new movement then led by some of their professors a striking similarity to the Renaissance in Europe. These prominent features in the movement reminded them of the European Renaissance. First, it was a conscious movement to promote a new literature in the living language of the people to take the place of the classical literature of old. Second, it was a movement of conscious protest against many of the ideas and institutions in the traditional culture, and of conscious emancipation of the individual man and woman from the bondage of forces of tradition. It was a movement of reason versus tradition, freedom versus authority, and glorification of life and human values versus their suppression. And lastly, strange enough, this new movement was led by men who knew their culture heritage and tried to study it with the new methodology of modern historical criticism and research. In that sense it was a humanist movement.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1646" id="calibre_link-1710" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1137" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>A few observations may be made with respect to this account of the origin of the idea of “Chinese Renaissance.” First, it is indeed true that the English subtitle of the student magazine <i class="calibre9">Xinchao</i> <span>新</span><span>潮</span> (New Tide) of Beijing University was suggested by a founding member of the New Tide Society in 1918. However, Hu’s self-effacing modesty prevented him from revealing the important fact that he himself had been the patron saint of this influential publication from its conception.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1647" id="calibre_link-1711" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> Second, it was Hu Shi who in 1917 drew the analogy between the literary revolution he was then advocating and the European Renaissance. During his return to China in June 1917, he read Edith Sichel’s <i class="calibre9">The Renaissance</i> (1915) as his train rolled across the Canadian Rockies toward Vancouver.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1648" id="calibre_link-1712" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> Much to his gratification, he found his advocacy of vernacular as opposed to classical language as the medium of Chinese literature historically justified by the rise of vernacular literature in Renaissance Europe. Dante and Petrarch, Hu Shi noted, began to use vernacular language in their writings. His attention was particularly drawn to the fact that although Leon Battista Alberti openly declared Latin “a dead language,” Cardinal Pietro Bembo eventually settled the question by coming down on the side of the vernacular in his <i class="calibre9">Prose della volgar lingua</i> (Discussions of the vernacular language; 1525).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1649" id="calibre_link-1713" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> There can be no question that the adoption of the “The Renaissance” as the English subtitle of the student magazine was due to Hu Shi’s inspiration. Third, of the three prominent features listed in the passage quoted above, the second one, defined in terms of “reason versus tradition,” “freedom versus authority,” is clearly more characteristic of the Enlightenment than the Renaissance. This, however, should occasion no surprise. With all his talk of Renaissance, Hu Shi after all was more directly an intellectual heir of the French Enlightenment than of Italian humanism. In more ways than one, he reminded his Western contemporaries of Voltaire.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1650" id="calibre_link-1714" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> Moreover, from many of his public lectures on cultural trends in the modern world, we get an unmistakable impression that Hu Shi took the Renaissance as the true beginning of modernity in the West and viewed all subsequent developments, such as the Reformation, the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment, industrialization, the democratic revolutions, and even the socialist movements as if they were elements in a linear progression of modernity following the Renaissance. It was probably because of his emphasis on the continuity of the Enlightenment with the Renaissance that he sometimes failed to draw a line between the two, as shown in the characterization quoted above.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1651" id="calibre_link-1715" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>At this juncture, we need to examine a little more closely the notion of Enlightenment as applied to the May Fourth Movement. As far as I know, it was the Marxists who first interpreted the May Fourth Movement in Enlightenment terms. In 1936, several underground Communists launched a “New Enlightenment” Movement in Beijing and Shanghai. In the <i class="calibre9">Zhexue da cidian</i> <span>哲</span><span>學</span><span>大</span><span>詞</span><span>典</span> (Great dictionary of philosophy), published in 1985, this movement is defined as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-986" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The New Enlightenment Movement is also known as the “New Rationalist” Movement. It was an intellectual and cultural movement that unfolded in response to the national struggle against Japan during the 1930s. It was also the continuation and development of the May Fourth Enlightenment Movement. In September and October of 1936, it was first suggested in two articles&mdash;“The Mobilization of Philosophy for National Defense” and “The New Culture Movement in Present-Day China”&mdash;by members of the Chinese Communist Party. They proposed that a joint effort be made to promote the spirit of the May Fourth revolutionary tradition; they made a clarion call to the patriots to start…a large-scale new enlightenment movement in order to awaken the masses to the need for a war of resistance and democracy…. The New Enlightenment Movement lasted for a year until the complete breakout of the war of resistance against Japan and the formation of the anti-Japanese united front for national salvation at the end of 1937. It played a positive role in clearing ignorance as well as disseminating anti-Japanese propaganda.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1652" id="calibre_link-1716" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>From this account it is clear that the Communists reinterpreted May Fourth as “Enlightenment” because they needed a “New Enlightenment” Movement to carry out the party line of a new “united front.” It is important to know that the authors of the two articles referred to above are none other than Chen Boda <span>陳</span><span>伯</span><span>達</span> (1904&ndash;1989) and Ai Siqi <span>艾</span><span>思</span><span>奇</span> (1910&ndash;1966), two leading party ideologues active in Beijing and Shanghai educational and cultural circles under disguises. I must also emphatically point out that of the two, Chen was a more senior and far more important member of the Communist Party. It was Chen who initiated the New Enlightenment Movement. At first it may seem very puzzling that a man practically unknown in the Chinese intellectual world could launch a movement single-handedly that was immediately and enthusiastically received by many leftist magazines in Beijing and Shanghai. However, once we know who Chen Boda really was, the puzzle disappears. In early 1936, when Liu Shaoqi <span>劉</span><span>少</span><span>奇</span> (1898&ndash;1969) arrived in Tianjin to head the underground North China Bureau of the Communist Party, Chen was appointed chief of its Department of Propaganda. It was in this new official capacity that Chen utilized the May Fourth legacy in the name of “Enlightenment” to fulfill the task recently assigned by the party. In his own words, “We want to form the broadest possible united front with all individuals loyal to the fatherland, all patriots, all liberals, all democrats, all rationalists, all natural scientists.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1653" id="calibre_link-1717" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> Here, it must be noted, the word “we” is not an editorial usage, but a coded reference to the party. Needless to say, all the initial positive responses from leftist journalism were orchestrated by the party through its underground network.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Moreover, the New Enlightenment Movement was closely related to the famous December Ninth Movement of 1935. The latter has been viewed by some of its participants as “a direct outgrowth and fulfillment of the aspirations of the original student movement of 1919.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1654" id="calibre_link-1718" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> In a crucial aspect, however, December Ninth of 1935 is different from May Fourth of 1919. As Fu Sinian <span>傅</span><span>斯</span><span>年</span> (1896&ndash;1950) recalled in 1946: “Many people said that during the May Fourth Movement of 1919, we students were manipulated by certain politicians in the North. This was definitely nonsense. I was involved centrally in that movement. I know for a fact that nobody manipulated me, nobody asked me to rise against the unpatriotic government that was about to sign the Treaty of Versailles.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1655" id="calibre_link-1719" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> In the case of the December Ninth student demonstration of 1935, however, we now know that it, like the New Enlightenment Movement, was carefully planned and implemented by the underground cells of the Communist Party. According to the firsthand account of Gao Wenhua <span>高</span><span>文</span><span>華</span> (fl. 1930s), party secretary of the North China Bureau:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-987" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Students unrest culminated in the December Ninth Movement.

Those who directly led it in the open included Comrades Li Chang <span>李</span><span>昌</span>, Jiang Nanxiang <span>蔣</span><span>南</span><span>翔</span> (party secretary of the Qinghua University branch), Lin Feng <span>林</span><span>楓</span>, Yao Yilin <span>姚</span><span>翼</span><span>林</span>, Xu Bing <span>徐</span><span>冰</span>, Xu Deheng <span>許</span><span>德</span><span>珩</span>, and others.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1656" id="calibre_link-1720" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Moreover, Lu Cui <span>陸</span><span>璀</span> (fl. 1930s), a student leader of the December Ninth demonstration described by Edgar Snow in 1935 as “China’s Joan of Arc,” now openly admits, in a collection of her propaganda writings published in commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of this historic event, that she was then working under the direct guidance of the party’s underground organization.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1657" id="calibre_link-1721" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup> Obviously, the two movements&mdash;December Ninth and the New Enlightenment&mdash;were ingeniously masterminded to support each other in a way very much reminiscent of the relationship between May Fourth in its narrow sense (the student demonstration of 1919) and May Fourth in its broad sense (what Hu Shi and the New Tide Society called the “Renaissance”). Now, with its origins in the North China Bureau, it does not seem to make much sense to say that the former was “a direct outgrowth and fulfillment of the aspirations of the original student movement of 1919” and that the latter was “the continuation and development of the May Fourth Enlightenment Movement.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Since the New Enlightenment Movement was conceived from the beginning to serve the needs of a hidden political agenda,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1658" id="calibre_link-1722" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> its proponents did not even bother to justify why, on intellectual grounds, “Enlightenment” was a better appellation for May Fourth than “Renaissance.” From the political point of view, they linked both May Fourth and New Enlightenment to patriotism. Chinese Enlightenment, old and new, according to Ai Siqi, must take patriotism as its main task.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1659" id="calibre_link-1723" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> But anyone familiar with European Enlightenment knows how absurd it is to relate patriotism to Enlightenment. With the possible exception of Rousseau, the philosophes were all cosmopolitans who took as their calling, not to exalt the interest of country, but to cultivate, enlighten, and ennoble mankind.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1660" id="calibre_link-1724" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1078" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It is interesting to note that Chinese Marxists as a rule preferred Enlightenment to Renaissance. Whenever a period of Chinese history was compared to the Renaissance by earlier authors, they would change the analogy to Enlightenment. There is another example in addition to the May Fourth case. Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929), early and late in his career, insisted on characterizing the intellectual history of the Qing Period as China’s “age of Renaissance.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1661" id="calibre_link-1725" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> The Marxist historian Hou Wailu <span>候</span><span>外</span><span>廬</span> (1906&ndash;1988) rejected Liang’s analogy, however, and instead made a sustained and systematic effort to reinterpret the same period as “early Enlightenment.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1662" id="calibre_link-1726" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> Now, we must ask: Why were the Chinese Marxists so obsessed with the idea of Enlightenment? I would like to hazard a few suggestions. First, according to the Marxist theory of history, as China entered the historical stage of capitalism, it had to experience a large-scale social expression of bourgeois consciousness similar to the French Enlightenment. May Fourth as an intellectual movement fits nicely into this scheme. Second, Diderot once wrote to Voltaire praising him for exciting “in our hearts an intense hatred of lying, ignorance, hypocrisy, superstition, tyranny.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1663" id="calibre_link-1727" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> Much of iconoclastic and anti-Confucian writings by May Fourth intellectuals can be similarly characterized.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1664" id="calibre_link-1728" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> It was this destructive side of May Fourth that particularly appealed to Chinese Marxists. Third, Chinese Marxists were advocates of revolution. Since, as they noted, the Enlightenment Movement often preceded political revolution in European countries, they needed an Enlightenment to justify their advocacy of revolution in China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1665" id="calibre_link-1729" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> In light of the above analysis, I am inclined to think the Chinese Marxists’ persistence in redefining May Fourth in terms of Enlightenment did not arise out of a whimsical reading of history. On the contrary, they probably made a deliberate and calculated choice based on the sentiment that their political radicalism would be much better served by Enlightenment than by Renaissance, which was, in any case, too remote as well as too mild to be of immediate, practical relevance.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>By the same token, we must also take Hu Shi and other liberals’ espousal of Renaissance very seriously. From 1917 on, Hu Shi always insisted that May Fourth as an intellectual or cultural movement must be understood as the Chinese Renaissance. This is not only because of his advocacy of vernacular language as the modern literary medium, but more important, also because of his profound sense of historical continuity. To him, “Renaissance” suggests renovation rather than destruction of the Chinese tradition.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1666" id="calibre_link-1730" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup> In spite of his often severe criticisms, Hu Shi’s rejection of the Chinese tradition, including Confucianism, was far from total. Central to the notion of Renaissance was his belief in the possibility of breathing new life into the old civilization of China. As early as 1917, he clearly stated the problem as follows: “How can we best assimilate modern civilization in such a manner as to make it congenial and congruous and continuous with the civilization of our own making?” The solution he then offered was that it “will depend solely on the foresight and the sense of historical continuity of the intellectual leaders of New China, and on the tact and skill with which they can successfully connect the best in modern civilization with the best in our own civilization.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1667" id="calibre_link-1731" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> This sounds a far cry from a total break with the Chinese past. Later, in 1933, he stated in concrete terms what was “best” in each civilization and how the two could be skillfully “connected”:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2490" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Slowly, quietly, but unmistakably, the Chinese Renaissance is becoming a reality. The product of this rebirth looks suspiciously occidental. But, scratch its surface and you will find that the stuff of which it is made is essentially Chinese bedrock, which much weathering and corrosion have only made stand out more clearly&mdash;the humanistic and rationalistic China resurrected by the touch of the scientific and democratic civilization of the new world.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1668" id="calibre_link-1732" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="indent"><span>In hindsight, we cannot help but laugh at the premature optimism of this “incurable optimist,” as Hu Shi was known to his friends. However, he remained undaunted even at the very end of his life. In “The Chinese Tradition and the Future,” his speech to open the Sino-American Conference on Intellectual Cooperation held at the University of Washington in July 1960, he made his final attempt at a systematic application of the Renaissance concept to Chinese history. He distinguished altogether three Renaissances in Chinese history before the May Fourth one. The first was the Renaissance in Chinese literature in the eighth and ninth centuries when vernacular language began to appear in poetry and recorded conversations of Chan monks. The second Renaissance occurred in philosophy. By this, he referred primarily to the rise of Neo-Confucianism in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The third Renaissance was the “Revival of Learning” in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when humanist scholars began to use “scientific methods” to study classical and historical texts on a large scale. Here, obviously, he was following Liang Qichao’s interpretation of Qing intellectual history, as mentioned above.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1669" id="calibre_link-1733" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It is beside the point whether we can accept his grand narrative of Chinese history woven around the central thread of “Renaissance.” The important point is that, contrary to his popular image as a radical antitraditionalist, Hu Shi, early and late in his career, always needed some parts of the Chinese tradition to justify the Chinese Renaissance of which he was a leading participant. Thus, at the end of his speech, he emphatically concluded, “In short, I believe the tradition of ‘the humanistic and rationalist China’ has not been destroyed and in all probability cannot be destroyed.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1670" id="calibre_link-1734" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup> It was indeed an expression of his personal faith, not an established historical fact, to make this claim in 1960 for the Chinese tradition he particularly cherished. However, he had no choice but to keep that faith alive, for if that particular tradition were destroyed, so would be the Chinese Renaissance of the May Fourth era, which was nothing if not the alpha and omega of his own identity.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1087" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>To conclude this part of my discussion, allow me to begin by suggesting that Renaissance and Enlightenment must not be taken lightly as two different analogical concepts randomly borrowed to characterize the May Fourth Movement. Instead, they must be taken seriously as representing two incompatible projects, each leading to a course of action on its own. Simply put, Renaissance was originally conceived as a cultural and intellectual project, whereas Enlightenment was essentially a political project in disguise. Central to the Renaissance project was the notion of intellectual autonomy. Knowledge and art must be pursued primarily as ends in themselves, not to serve some other higher purposes, whether they be political, economic, religious, or moral. It was precisely for this reason that Hu Shi often regretted that the student movement of May Fourth, 1919, though laudable for its patriotism, was nevertheless an unwelcome interruption as far as the Chinese Renaissance was concerned, for it marked the beginning of the politicization of Chinese academia, thereby undermining intellectual autonomy before it could be securely established in modern China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1671" id="calibre_link-1735" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> In contrast, the Enlightenment project designed by Chinese Marxists was ultimately revolution oriented. With the emphasis placed squarely on patriotism and national salvation, Marxist advocates of the New Enlightenment only recognized in culture and thought an ideological function in the service of revolution. The idea of intellectual autonomy was by and large alien to them. No wonder Mao Zedong <span>毛</span><span>澤</span><span>東</span> (1893&ndash;1976)’s view of May Fourth was diametrically opposed to Hu Shi’s. His highest praise was reserved for the student movement of May Fourth, 1919, which, in his view, led to the revolution of 1925&ndash;1927.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1672" id="calibre_link-1736" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup> Ironically, even the New Enlightenment itself turned out to be no more than “false consciousness.” No sooner had it served the purpose of the formation of a united front than it fell into oblivion. The idea of Enlightenment did not resurface until the end of the 1970s, when the Communist Party needed a “reliberation of thought” to turn itself around under completely new circumstances.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Renaissance preceded Enlightenment by two decades but gave way to the latter eventually. This was perhaps due less to the intrinsic merit of Enlightenment as a descriptive term for the May Fourth Movement than to the radicalization of the Chinese mentality. The Renaissance project was deeply rooted in Anglo-American liberalism, which found China less than habitable as the national crisis continued to deepen in the 1930s. Wedded to nationalism on the one hand and veiled behind Enlightenment on the other, Marxist radicalism became extremely attractive to student activists all over China. Renaissance could no longer find as many sympathetic ears in the new generation of university students as it had in 1918.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Above, I have delineated two contrasting projects in the May Fourth Movement represented by Renaissance and Enlightenment. Although the term “Enlightenment” was not applied to May Fourth until 1936, the Marxist project itself was already set in motion in 1920 at the latest, when Chen Duxiu <span>陳</span><span>獨</span><span>秀</span> (1879&ndash;1942) moved the powerful magazine <i class="calibre9">Xin Qingnian</i> <span>新</span><span>青</span><span>年</span> (New Youth; also known as <i class="calibre9">La Jeunesse</i>) from Beijing to Shanghai and transformed the magazine into “a Chinese version of <i class="calibre9">Soviet Russia</i>,” the New York Communist weekly pictorial.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1673" id="calibre_link-1737" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> This resulted in the split in the New Youth Society between the left wing under Chen’s leadership and the liberal wing in Beijing headed by Hu Shi. From this time on, the left wing began to direct May Fourth toward political revolution by actively engaging in ever-broadening mass organization and mobilization, whereas the liberal wing continued to expand the original Renaissance project in the cultural and intellectual realm.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1150" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>A further clarification with regard to the Enlightenment project is in order. The substitution of Enlightenment for Renaissance as a description of May Fourth in recent years is primarily due, as shown earlier, to the efforts of Chinese Marxists traceable to the 1930s. It is for this reason that I find it useful to draw a sharp contrast between the Marxist interpretation of May Fourth as Enlightenment, on the one hand, and the liberal interpretation of it as Renaissance, on the other. What I refer to as the “Enlightenment project” is therefore, in truth, the Marxist project. However, I am not suggesting even in the slightest that anyone who understands May Fourth in terms of Enlightenment must subscribe to the Marxist point of view. As I have already indicated above, there are indeed many valid reasons to argue for the analogy between May Fourth and the Enlightenment, if an analogical approach is to be followed in historical research, which, of course, is highly problematical. It is interesting to note that Luo Jialun <span>羅</span><span>家</span><span>倫</span> (1896&ndash;1969), Hu Shi’s leading disciple and founder of <i class="calibre9">New Tide</i> (<i class="calibre9">Renaissance</i>), also compared May Fourth to the Enlightenment many years later. He said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>May Fourth, first and foremost, represents the awakening of a new culture consciousness…and is very similar to the eighteenth-century European Enlightenment…. Enlightenment figures such as Rousseau and Diderot used fierce criticism to break through the confines of old thought. Moreover, they used a scientific attitude and the spirit of freedom not only to reconsider prevailing literary tendencies…but also to undertake a thorough inquiry into the political and social system as well.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1674" id="calibre_link-1738" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Luo’s use of Enlightenment instead of Renaissance as analogy was in all probability influenced by Li Changzhi <span>李</span><span>長</span><span>之</span> (1910&ndash;1978), who was on the faculty of the Central University in the early 1940s when Luo served as its president.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1197" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Equally at home with the literary and philosophical traditions of China and Europe, Li Changzhi developed penetrating observations of May Fourth as a cultural movement. He weighed carefully and on intellectual grounds the pros and cons of the two analogies as applied to May Fourth and came to the conclusion that May Fourth bore a family resemblance not to the Renaissance but to the Enlightenment. He arrived at this conclusion independently of the Marxist New Enlightenment Movement and for completely different reasons. He meant to exalt Renaissance and downgrade Enlightenment. According to him, to the extent that the May Fourth mentality was rational, critical, skeptical, iconoclastic, practical, scientific, and antimetaphysical, it is justifiable to identify May Fourth with Enlightenment. However, the main trouble with this Enlightenment mentality is its shallowness; it cannot appreciate anything intellectually profound. As a result, in philosophy, Dewey, Huxley, Darwin, and Marx became fashionable, while Plato, Kant, and Hegel were little discussed. He further pointed out that the May Fourth spirit is antithetical to the Renaissance, which by definition implies both a return to and a revival of the classical tradition. May Fourth intellectuals showed neither an appreciation for their own early tradition nor an understanding of the classical culture of the West. Confucius was ferociously attacked as an apologist of the “feudal order,” whereas Plato was dismissed as a mere “metaphysician.” It was a classic case of a misnomer when Western scholars labeled Hu Shi the “Father of the Chinese Renaissance.” Despite his scathing criticism, I must hasten to add that Li was not wholly negative about May Fourth as a cultural movement. May Fourth cleared the old cultural ground through its destructive work and thereby opened up China for the real possibility of cultural reconstruction, but the important thing was, he concluded, to start a true Chinese Renaissance by going beyond the Enlightenment.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1675" id="calibre_link-1739" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup> His revised version of a “Renaissance project” does not seem to have evoked much enthusiastic response in the Chinese intellectual world during the war-ridden and politically polarized 1940s, but it has begun to strike a sympathetic chord among a new generation of Chinese intellectuals who are moving away from the positivistic mode of thinking of the Marxist variety toward an “interpretive turn” in the human sciences.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1676" id="calibre_link-1740" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>What I find particularly interesting in Li Changzhi’s reevaluation of May Fourth is his open acknowledgment that May Fourth as a cultural movement must be clearly recognized, first of all, as a movement of cultural borrowing, or, as he puts it, the transplantation of Western culture to China without ever taking roots in its soil.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1677" id="calibre_link-1741" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup> In a sense, this is an obvious fact. Why should I find such a truism interesting? It deserves attention, I believe, for several reasons. First, as far as I know, no one has stated this plain truth so empathetically and with such a degree of seriousness. Second, this statement, though basically true, is nevertheless somewhat misleading if understood in the sense that those Western ideas and theories that had stirred up so many Chinese intellectuals of the May Fourth generation were completely without basis in the cultural reality in which they found themselves. Elsewhere I have tried to show that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Chinese intellectuals, generally speaking, responded with genuine enthusiasm only to those Western values and ideas that struck chords in their own traditions.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1678" id="calibre_link-1742" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup> Finally, the plain fact undermines the very foundation on which the analogy between May Fourth on the one hand and Renaissance or Enlightenment on the other is built. The reason is not far to seek: in their own historical context, neither the Renaissance nor the Enlightenment was a result of cultural borrowing; each was the flowering of internal development and growth over many centuries of European culture. It is on this last point that I wish to comment further to clarify the nature of May Fourth as a cultural movement.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1151" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>To begin with, I propose to altogether discard analogy in the study of Chinese history. If we can neither recognize general laws in history nor take the unique pattern of European historical experiences as the universal model for all non-Western societies, why must we bother even to raise the question whether there was a Renaissance or an Enlightenment in Chinese history in the first place? We would do well to see the May Fourth Movement as it really was. It was, as Li Changzhi rightly observed, first and foremost a cultural movement in response to the stimulus of Western ideas. May Fourth intellectuals did consciously borrow ideas from the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. That is precisely why one can interpret May Fourth in terms of either with some justification. But May Fourth was neither the Chinese Renaissance nor the Chinese Enlightenment for the simple reason that a great variety of Western ideas and values other than Renaissance and Enlightenment were also introduced into China during the same period. If we carry analogical thinking to its extreme, then we would have to crowd many centuries of European history into the brief space of one or two decades of twentieth-century China which, needless to say, amounts to a monstrous absurdity.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Once we are free of the obsession with rigid analogy, we can begin to understand May Fourth in its own terms. In my earlier study of the radicalization of China in the twentieth century, I pointed out that “during the May Fourth era beginning with the literary revolution of 1917, a paradigmatic change took place in the development of radicalism in modern China. From this time on, whether in criticizing the tradition or advocating changes, Chinese intellectuals would almost invariably invoke some Western ideas, values or institutions as ultimate grounds for justification.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1679" id="calibre_link-1743" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup> Now, in the context of the present discussion, I would add that the same principles also held true for Chinese conservatives during the May Fourth Period. More often than not, they, too, appealed to Western authors in defending the Chinese tradition. Li Changzhi’s definition of May Fourth in terms of the transplantation of Western culture to China must also be understood in this light. If we take the notion of “enlightenment” as a metaphor rather than an analogy, we may say that May Fourth is different from the European Enlightenment in a very fundamental way. When the Enlightenment philosophes attacked Christianity, scholasticism, and the “Dark” Middle Ages, they were armed with the classics of Greek and Roman antiquity. In other words, they were guided by an inner light. By contrast, May Fourth intellectuals had to go out of their darkened cave&mdash;China&mdash;to see the light of day; they were guided by a light from outside&mdash;the West. Or, to borrow Mao Zedong’s famous saying, China has been “seeking truth from the West since the end of the nineteenth century.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1279" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In its early days, May Fourth was also popularly known in China by the names “New Culture” or “New Thought,” which seem to be more descriptive and less misleading than either “Renaissance” or “Enlightenment.” As a matter of fact, the identity of May Fourth with the term “New Culture” has been more firmly established than with any other term, at least in Chinese writing. In this connection, I propose to use Hu Shi’s definition as the point of departure to reexamine the idea of New Culture and its place in the intellectual history of twentieth-century China. His 1919 article “Xin sichao de yiyi” <span>新</span><span>思</span><span>潮</span><span>的</span><span>意</span><span>義</span> (The meaning of new thought) begins by pointing out that “the fundamental significance of the new thought lies simply in a new attitude,” which may be called the “critical attitude.” It then goes on to list three specific tasks to be carried out under the guidance of this critical spirit: the first is to “study problems.” There are many concrete problems in China&mdash;social, political, religious, literary&mdash;that require our immediate attention. They must be critically studied so that solutions may be found. The second is to support new ideas, new learning, new literature, and new faith from the West. They not only meet the spiritual needs of Chinese intellectuals but can also provide them with theoretical guidance in their search for solutions to China’s concrete problems. The third is to apply the critical spirit to the study of the Chinese intellectual tradition under the catchphrase “systematic reorganization of the national heritage” (<i class="calibre9">zhengli guogu</i> <span>整</span><span>理</span><span>國</span><span>故</span>). In the interest of self-understanding, China’s old tradition must be critically and systematically reexamined. Only then can we develop an objective understanding of the various parts of our own intellectual heritage in historical perspective and determine their respective values. Finally, it concludes by suggesting that the ultimate goal of the new cultural movement is the reconstruction of Chinese civilization.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1680" id="calibre_link-1744" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Here Hu Shi presented a New Culture project formulated in its broadest possible terms and at a higher level. Defined in this way, the New Culture is not just about advocacy of Western values and ideas such as democracy, science, autonomy of the individual, emancipation of women, and the like. Nor is its central significance limited to the denunciation of the Chinese tradition, including, especially, the theory and practice of Confucianism. From his point of view, all the above matters of a practical nature&mdash;the list is endless&mdash;can likely be included in the category of “study problems.” However, in promoting simultaneously the importation of Western thought and scholarship on the one hand and the “systematic reorganization of national heritage” on the other, he seems to have returned to the theme he had set forth in 1917, namely, how to “connect the best in modern civilization with the best in our own civilization.” It is not my purpose here to offer a detailed commentary on Hu Shi’s essay. Instead, I merely wish to use it as a starting point to suggest a new way of looking at the intellectual history of the May Fourth era.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1022" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>If the New Thought or New Culture is definable in terms of a critical spirit under the guidance of which both Western and Chinese learning are to be pursued with the purpose, explicit or implicit, of illuminating each other in order to achieve, ultimately, a creative syntheses, then the very concept would have to be stretched to the extent of including every active member of the May Fourth intellectual world as a participant of the New Culture Movement, for the simple truth is that those who are often labeled as “conservative” critics of the May Fourth Movement turned out to be no less critical and no less Westernized than their “progressive” rivals. To illustrate my point, let me give one or two examples. By general consensus, Liang Shuming <span>梁</span><span>漱</span><span>溟</span> (1893&ndash;1988) was a cultural “conservative” par excellence. However, is his justly famous <i class="calibre9">Dongxi wenhua ji qi zhexue</i> <span>東</span><span>西</span><span>文</span><span>化</span><span>及</span><span>其</span><span>哲</span><span>學</span><sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1681" id="calibre_link-1745" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup> (Eastern and Western cultures and their philosophies) of 1920 part of the New Culture or not? Surprisingly, the following is what Hu Shi had to say about it in his 1926 lecture on “The Renaissance in China”:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>For the first time in history we begin to recognize a new attitude, a desire to understand the basic meaning of modern civilization, to understand the philosophy behind the civilization of the West. As the best example of this new consciousness I may cite the work of a Chinese scholar, Liang Shu-ming…. He is voicing the yearning of a new age. His book was widely read and much has been written since on the same subject…. May I suggest that in these discussions we find a completely new attitude, an attitude on the one hand of frank admission of our own weaknesses, all the weak points in Oriental civilization; and on the other hand, the attitude of a frank, genuine understanding of the spirit, not only the material prosperity, but also the spiritual possibilities of the Western civilization.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1682" id="calibre_link-1746" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>I have quoted Hu Shi at some length because his words bear importantly and directly on my point. The “new attitude” he recognized in Liang’s work is exactly what he had described as “the fundamental significance of the new thought” in 1919. Thus, by Hu Shi’s own admission, Liang’s study of Eastern and Western cultures and philosophies is very much a constituent part of the so-called Chinese Renaissance.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Next, I would also like to cite the example of Mei Guangdi <span>梅</span><span>光</span><span>迪</span> (1890&ndash;1945) in support of my contention. Mei, as is generally known, was one of Hu Shi’s most intimate friends in their younger days, but in 1917, they became bitter intellectual rivals as a result of Mei’s violent opposition to the literary revolution.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In 1922, Mei with Wu Mi <span>吳</span><span>宓</span> (1894&ndash;1978), both leading Chinese disciples of Irving Babbitt, founded <i class="calibre9">Xueheng</i> <span>學</span><span>衡</span> (Critical review; 1922&ndash;1933), which, as a Chinese writer vividly described it in 1934, stood “for everything that Dr. Hu Shih [was] against. The avowed aim of the <i class="calibre9">Critical Review</i>…was to fight the <i class="calibre9">baihua</i> <span>白</span><span>話</span> movement, and to strive to maintain the old ways of writing. It was a losing battle, but the effort was heroic.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1683" id="calibre_link-1747" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup> Hence, Mei and the <i class="calibre9">Critical Review</i> were contemptuously dismissed as conservative nonsense by May Fourth leaders, including Hu Shi and Lu Xun <span>魯</span><span>迅</span> (1881&ndash;1936).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1684" id="calibre_link-1748" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">43</a></small></sup> It would seem unquestionable that Mei not only placed himself outside the New Culture of the May Fourth era but was also its most relentless enemy. Forty-five of Mei’s letters to Hu Shi have now been published, however, and they throw a completely different light on his relationship to the rise of the New Culture as later promoted by Hu Shi. Without going into details, allow me to report a few of what I consider to be significant findings.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1322" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>First, from October 1911 on, Mei wrote Hu Shi several long letters discussing the problem of Confucianism in modern China. At this time, probably due to the lingering influence of his father, Hu was still very much a believer in Cheng-Zhu <span>程</span><span>朱</span> Neo-Confucianism. Mei severely attacked the Cheng-Zhu orthodoxy and urged Hu Shi to move on to the learning of Yan Yuan <span>顏</span><span>元</span> (1635&ndash;1704) and Li Gong <span>李</span><span>塨</span> (1659&ndash;1733), which emphasized the central importance of social and political practice in the original teaching of Confucius and Mencius as opposed to the idle speculation of Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucian philosophy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1685" id="calibre_link-1749" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">44</a></small></sup> At first, Hu resisted the suggestion; however, it sowed the seed of his ardent advocacy of the Yan-Li school a decade later.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1686" id="calibre_link-1750" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">45</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Second, Mei was not only equally dissatisfied with Han and Song Confucianism but also highly critical of the National Essence (<i class="calibre9">Guocui</i> <span>國</span><span>粹</span>) school then very much in vogue in China, which, he thought, still uncritically followed traditional commentaries on the Confucian classics.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1687" id="calibre_link-1751" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">46</a></small></sup> He was aiming at a higher synthesis of the Confucian tradition and Western culture. This could be accomplished only in two stages: a thorough purification of the Confucian tradition of the past two thousand years and a firm grasp of European learning with special emphasis on its classical beginning. Old Chinese texts, said he, must now be studied in light of the Western system of organizing human knowledge such as literature, philosophy, law, and the like.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1688" id="calibre_link-1752" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">47</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Third, in his letter dated March 19, 1916, Mei wrote:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In the future, if I could introduce Western literary knowledge to China and provide a new point of view for the study of our traditional literature, and thereby set some examples for younger scholars to follow, I would feel my wish more than fulfilled…I am much enlightened by your discussions of Song and Yuan literature in your letter. It goes without saying that the [present] literary revolution ought to begin with “people’s literature” (such as folklore, popular poetry, spoken language, etc.). However, it must go through a great war, for the sudden talk of vernacular literature will inevitably be ridiculed and attacked by conservative men of letters. But on our part, we rather welcome their ridicule and attacks.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1689" id="calibre_link-1753" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">48</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1023" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In view of this letter, Mei was actually an enthusiastic participant of Hu’s literary revolution in its early days, even though he disagreed strongly with Hu’s literary taste. Moreover, I have also carefully checked Mei’s letters as quoted by Hu Shi against the original. There can be little doubt that Mei has been made a villain of the literary revolution by being quoted out of context. In these letters, Mei repeatedly tried to make his position clear to Hu Shi: that he was sympathetic to the literary revolution but could not go with him so far as to glorify the spoken language (<i class="calibre9">baihua</i>) beyond its limit. He told Hu in no uncertain terms that he was not necessarily less iconoclastic than Hu; he refused to embrace the “new currents” in literature and art, not because he was “conservative” but because he was “too skeptical, too independent.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1690" id="calibre_link-1754" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">49</a></small></sup> In light of this new evidence, we can say almost with certainty that it was Hu Shi’s ever-growing radicalism in the subsequent debates that eventually pushed Mei to extreme conservatism. However, had Mei lived until 1952, he would have felt fully vindicated when Hu Shi, in his turn, became thoroughly disgusted with the “new poetry” and “new literature” in American colleges.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1691" id="calibre_link-1755" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">50</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Finally, in political and social views, Mei was always a moderate liberal, just as Hu was. He was, from the beginning, on the side of the republican revolution and, later, when Yuan Shikai <span>袁</span><span>世</span><span>凱</span> (1859&ndash;1916) betrayed the republic, his sympathy was wholly with the Nationalist Party. His deep differences with Hu Shi in literature and philosophy did not prevent him from expressing his admiration for Hu’s published statement against Yuan in American magazines. He even volunteered to write the revolutionary leader Huang Xing <span>黃</span><span>興</span> (1874&ndash;1916) to recommend that Hu be appointed the spokesman for the republican cause. In his own words, “Hu Shi, being equally fluent in Chinese and English, is the only person among Chinese students in America who can use his pen to turn around the public opinion of this country.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1692" id="calibre_link-1756" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">51</a></small></sup> In a letter dated December 28, 1916, in which he continued his debate with Hu Shi on the literary revolution, he nevertheless tried, in a rather reconciliatory tone, to seek a basic agreement with Hu on general “views of life.” He suggested to Hu in earnest that his Babbittian humanism and Hu’s Deweyan experimentalism shared more in common than they differed from each other. Both were in favor of reform, with only one major difference: Babbitt held that it should begin with the individual and then gradually spread to the whole society, whereas Dewey seemed to take an opposite view with regard to the process of reform.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1693" id="calibre_link-1757" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">52</a></small></sup> Moreover, although deeply committed to the moral faith of Confucius and Mencius, Mei’s repudiation of imperial Confucianism as a political ideology was complete. He condemned both Han and Song Confucians for distorting Confucian teachings in the service of autocracy and social inequality, and repeatedly denounced the theory of “three bonds” (<i class="calibre9">san gang</i> <span>三</span><span>綱</span>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1694" id="calibre_link-1758" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">53</a></small></sup> Antitraditionalist outbursts such as these could have appeared in the pages on the <i class="calibre9">New Youth</i> without their author ever being suspected of being a founding member of the <i class="calibre9">Critical Review</i>. This explains why he did not hesitate to praise Hu Shi for his liberal political views as late as 1922.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1695" id="calibre_link-1759" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">54</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1026" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The case of Mei Guangdi and his <i class="calibre9">Critical Review</i> raises a serious question about the true identity of the New Culture of the May Fourth era. If the New Culture consisted, first and foremost, of the importation of Western ideas to China, as Hu Shi’s definition suggests, then Babbittian humanism was clearly just as “new” as Deweyan experimentalism to the intellectual world of May Fourth China. In a sense, the conflict between Hu Shi and his followers on the one hand and Mei Guangdi and the <i class="calibre9">Critical Review</i> on the other may well be viewed as the rivalry between Deweyan experimentalism and Babbittian humanism transferred from America to China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1696" id="calibre_link-1760" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">55</a></small></sup> This is only natural because in cultural borrowing, it is hardly possible to pick up a foreign idea without at the same time also calling someone else’s attention to its opposite. Can we then consider Babbittian humanism part and parcel of the New Culture of the May Fourth era? At least this question was answered in the affirmative by both Liang Shiqiu <span>梁</span><span>實</span><span>秋</span> (1901&ndash;1987) and Lin Yutang <span>林</span><span>語</span><span>堂</span> (1895&ndash;1976), whose credentials as members of the May Fourth Movement are impeccable. Having studied under Babbitt in 1924&ndash;1925, Liang returned to China convinced of his classical humanism. In the late 1920s, he edited a collection of Chinese articles on Babbitt, mostly from the pages of the <i class="calibre9">Critical Review</i>, and published it under the title <i class="calibre9">Baibide yu renwen zhuyi</i> <span>白</span><span>璧</span><span>德</span><span>與</span><span>人</span><span>文</span><span>主</span><span>義</span> (Babbitt and humanism). The publisher, it may be noted, was none other than the Crescent Moon Society in Shanghai, a stronghold of the New Culture, with Hu Shi as its patron saint.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1697" id="calibre_link-1761" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">56</a></small></sup> Lin Yutang, who studied with Babbitt at Harvard from 1919 to 1920, also wrote to Hu Shi that during his conversation with Babbitt, he sensed some misapprehension on the part of the latter regarding Hu’s points of view. However, he added that Babbitt, though against everything modern, was nevertheless right in his criticism of the neoteric mentality, which takes what is the newest to be the best. To Lin, it was the good fortune of the Chinese literary revolution to find a conscious and reflective opposition in people such as Babbitt and Mei Guangdi.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1698" id="calibre_link-1762" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">57</a></small></sup> Clearly, both Liang and Lin did not, to say the least, share the partisan spirit of Hu Shi and Lu Xun in dismissing Mei Guangdi and the <i class="calibre9">Critical Review</i> as completely external to the New Culture. It is interesting to note that just as there has been some renewed interest in Babbitt in the United States since the 1980s, Mei Guangdi and the <i class="calibre9">Critical Review</i> have also been rediscovered by Chinese intellectuals since the 1970s.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1699" id="calibre_link-1763" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">58</a></small></sup> There seems to be a growing trend toward placing the cultural conservatism of Mei Guangdi and Wu Mi, along with the radicalism of Chen Duxiu and Lu Xun and the liberalism of Hu Shi, in the same discursive structure of May Fourth New Culture.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1700" id="calibre_link-1764" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">59</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1037" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Before bringing my reflections to a close, I wish to say a few words about the other part of Hu Shi’s New Culture project&mdash;“the systematic reorganization of the national heritage.” In this vast field of, essentially, historical studies of the Chinese tradition in all its aspects, there is an even greater need to enlarge the concept of New Culture to accommodate some of the leading “national heritage” (<i class="calibre9">guogu</i> <span>國</span><span>故</span>) scholars. A few examples will suffice for the purpose of illustration. Wang Guowei <span>王</span><span>國</span><span>維</span> (1877&ndash;1927), universally acknowledged as one of the most “scientifically minded” and original historians of ancient China, was politically a Qing loyalist and culturally conservative. Chen Yinke <span>陳</span><span>寅</span><span>恪</span> (1890&ndash;1969), the leading medievalist, was both politically and culturally conservative, and never wrote a single sentence in the vernacular. And yet he freely admitted that China has been inferior to the West since classical antiquity not only in science but in philosophy and art as well.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1701" id="calibre_link-1765" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">60</a></small></sup> Tang Yongtong <span>湯</span><span>用</span><span>彤</span> (1893&ndash;1964), a great authority on the history of Chinese Buddhism and philosophy, was a contributor to the <i class="calibre9">Critical Review</i>, and like Chen Yinke, always used classical language in his writings. All three, needless to say, were unsympathetic to the May Fourth Movement in both its narrow and its broad senses. In the <i class="calibre9">guogu</i> field, however, Hu Shi admired them all and found them to be kindred spirits. The compliment was sometimes reciprocated, though not always. If we measure <i class="calibre9">guogu</i> scholars by such narrowly and rigidly defined May Fourth standards as vernacular language, positivist mentality, antitraditionalism, political radicalism or liberalism, ethical relativism, social egalitarianism, individualism, and the like, then a great majority, and easily the best of them, would have to be excluded from the New Culture of this era. As a result, what is left of the New Culture would be a linguistic world of conflicting ideological parodies but intellectually very much impoverished.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Daniel Bell once described himself as “a socialist in economics, a liberal in politics, and a conservative in culture.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1702" id="calibre_link-1766" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">61</a></small></sup> I believe many Chinese intellectuals of the May Fourth Period can be characterized in a similar way with, of course, a great variety of possible combinations. May Fourth has always been and still is many different things to different people. To me, it is primarily an age of cultural contradictions, and contradiction is, by definition, multidimensional as well as multidirectional. I can never bring myself to see it as a single coherent movement leading to a predetermined destination as if governed by an iron law of history. Each May Fourth intellectual not only seems unique, but many of them changed their minds quickly and sometimes drastically. Like the Russian intellectual before the Revolution who “could be a Westernizer in the morning, a Slavophil in the afternoon, and criticize after dinner,”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1703" id="calibre_link-1767" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">62</a></small></sup> the May Fourth intellectual was also capable of shifting his position constantly within a period of months, if not days and weeks. Surely, some larger intellectual types and certain patterns of ideas may be vaguely discerned in the May Fourth Movement in its broad sense. On the whole, however, it is extremely hazardous to generalize about these types and patterns. The Enlightenment republic of letters was described by Samuel Johnson as demonstrating “community of mind” because there was some kind of common core in that republic.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1704" id="calibre_link-1768" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">63</a></small></sup> Therefore, it may be permissible to speak of “the Enlightenment project.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1705" id="calibre_link-1769" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">64</a></small></sup> By contrast, the May Fourth intellectual world consisted of many communities of changing minds. Consequently, not only were there several May Fourth projects constantly undergoing changes and often conflicting with one another but each project also had different versions. Perhaps the safest generalization one can make about May Fourth is that it must always be understood in terms of its multidimensionality and multidirectionality.</span></div>

In the late fifteenth and the early sixteenth centuries, the relationship between the vernacular and neo-Latin was one of coexistence and cross-fertilization.

First, instead of proletarian revolution, it now adopted a moderate strategy to push for a “Democratic Republic” in China. Second, tactically, it made an appeal for an end to the civil war and to establish a “united front” in the broadest possible way with all parties and groups in China. This document came into Hu Shi’s possession in 1940, when he was ambassador to the United States (see “Zhonggong de cel<span>ü</span>e luxian” <span>中</span><span>國</span><span>的</span><span>策</span><span>略</span><span>路</span><span>線</span>, in vol. 6 of <i class="calibre9">Hu Shi de riji</i>). This document is authenticated by Mao Zedong’s report of May 1937 in <i class="calibre9">Mao Zedong xuanji</i> <span>毛</span><span>澤</span><span>東</span><span>選</span><span>集</span>, 4 vols. (Beijing: Renmin, 1969), 1:233, 246&ndash;247n6. It cannot be a mere coincidence that Chen Boda and Ai Siqi launched the New Enlightenment in September 1936, at exactly the same time that the new party began. Moreover, it is also extremely revealing that according to Wang Yuanhua <span>王</span><span>元</span><span>化</span>, who was then working for the party as a young writer, around 1938 the party suddenly decided to ban the term “Enlightenment” and thus brought the New Enlightenment Movement to an abrupt end.

Nevin contrasts Babbitt with Dewey as follows: “His stress upon will, attended by its helpmate the rational intellect, might have given him a basis for rapport with dominant philosophical trends of his time, notably those influenced by Dewey. But Babbitt’s focus was defiantly internal and individual. He scorned the problem-solving techniques of the sciences while he dreaded their inroads into humane values. He regarded the optimism of a generation of ‘instrumentalists’ and engineers as ill-founded and misguided, because no society, however adroitly planned or subjected to experiment, would never escape the human frailties documented in the works of Sophocles, Dante, and Goethe, and revealed to the wisdom of the humanely balanced individual.” Thomas R. Nevin, <i class="calibre9">Irving Babbitt: An Intellectual Study</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1984), 147. This passage applies perfectly to the intellectual tension between Mei Guangdi and Hu Shi, including the former’s attempt to reconcile his Babbittian humanism to Hu Shi’s Deweyan experimentalism.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1212" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">N</span>owadays the term “modernization” has lost much of the popularity it once enjoyed during the 1950s in the heyday of American modernization theory. In recent academic discourse, the place of “modernization” has been taken over by a number of “posts” beginning with “postmodern.” It is significant to note, however, that as early as the 1970s, some of the leading modernization theorists already found it necessary to reformulate the original thesis by way of clarification or modification. As a response to a widespread dissatisfaction with many of the assumptions of initial modernization studies, <i class="calibre9">Daedalus</i> devoted a whole special issue in 1973 to examining the topic of “Post-Traditional Societies.” According to S. N. Eisenstadt’s introductory essay, the term “post-traditional” was coined to “facilitate new ways of looking at certain central problems of modernization and development.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-159" id="calibre_link-199" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1129" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the wake of the Vietnam War, modernization theory declined markedly in influence. Among other things, it was accused of being ethnocentric in the sense that it used the historical experience of Western Europe and the United States as a standard for judging non-Western societies and cultures.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-160" id="calibre_link-200" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> With the rise of conflict theory in the late 1960s, the idea of “modernization” was considerably eclipsed, though not wholly replaced, by that of “revolution.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-161" id="calibre_link-201" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> Some harsh critics even rushed to sound the death knell for modernization theory. As vividly caricatured by Marion J. Levy Jr. in 1986, both politically and academically, it has been popular in recent years to declare that the whole field of modernization studies can easily be seen through by a child, that it constitutes no more than a set of rationalizations, that its generalizations are nowhere tenable or seldom so, and that the subject is at best a passé assemblage of vulgar imperialist prejudices. A sociologist has, in effect, buried the subject, albeit in a shallow grave.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-162" id="calibre_link-202" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>However, ironically, as a result of the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, it is theories of revolution that have been generally discredited. By contrast, as Francis Fukuyama rightly observes, “modernization theory looks much more persuasive in 1990 than it did fifteen or twenty years earlier when it came under heavy attack in academic circles.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-163" id="calibre_link-203" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As a historian, I wish to deal historically with this theme of the predicament of modernization in East Asia. First, I shall examine the idea of modernization as a historical phenomenon. Then I shall discuss the predicament of China’s modernization by relating it specifically to the changing conceptions of revolution. The following preliminary observations are offered in the hope that they may throw some new light on the uniqueness of the Chinese experience in this regard as a whole.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Historically speaking, modernization occurred only once and in the West. This is what we usually refer to as the rise and development of “modern Western civilization,” which, if viewed broadly, is marked by a number of milestones such as the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, the Glorious Revolution, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, etc. With these developments, Western civilization transformed itself, step by step, into the modern age&mdash;hence, the notion of “modernization.” The end product of the modernization of the West, as we all know, was the formation of capitalist society dominated by the bourgeois or middle class. Viewed in this way, modernization of the West can best be understood as an indigenous and spontaneous historical process over a period of five centuries.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Modernization theory, however, is a different matter. To begin with, as Habermas rightly observes, it disassociates Weber’s concept of “modernity” from its modern European origins and styles it into a spatial-temporally neutral model for processes of social development in general.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-164" id="calibre_link-204" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> Furthermore, it is undeniable that this theory is predicated on the assumption that there are certain historical laws that govern the evolution of all societies, Western and non-Western alike. Thus, according to the modernization paradigm, societies in the world today can be conveniently classified into three major categories: the “developed,” the “developing,” and the “underdeveloped.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1304" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It is not my intention here to question the validity of modernization theory. What I am trying to suggest is that the concept of modernization in its original Western meaning must not be confused with its derivative meaning as applied to non-Western societies. In the latter case, the so-called modernizing process did not arise out of the necessity of the historical turning point at which these societies found themselves. Instead, it was a process set in motion by the unique aggressiveness inherent in Western modernity. As Marx pointed out in 1858, “The specific task of bourgeois society is the establishment of a world market, at least in outline, and of production based upon this world market. As the world is round, this seems to have been completed by the colonization of California and Australia and the opening up of China and Japan.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-165" id="calibre_link-205" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> It is interesting to note that we have generally dated the beginning of the Modern Age of China and Japan from the time when Marx was writing this letter. As his wording unmistakably shows, however, Marx saw “the opening up of China and Japan” as part of the concluding chapter of the history of Western modernity.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As far as I am aware, there is absolutely no evidence that around the middle of the nineteenth century an “East Asian modernity” was already in the offing independently of the West. The conclusion is therefore inevitable that both China and Japan, and for that matter, all other non-Western societies, have been pushed into their “Modern Age” by the West. Such being the case, to speak of “modernization” with regard to non-Western societies makes sense only if one views the matter from the standpoint of the West. As for these societies themselves, the real problem was not, at least in the beginning, a matter of modernization that was wholly alien to their frames of mind. Rather, it was a matter of how to understand, respond to, and cope with the unprecedented crisis created by the highly disruptive forces of the invading West. However, it did not take non-Western peoples long to discover that for survival and self-affirmation, the only way to “out-Herod Herod” was to imitate the West. As the cases of late nineteenth-century China and Japan have amply shown, not only were science and technology borrowed from the West but Western institutions and customs also served as models for emulation. It is only natural that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these early attempts at modern transformations were generally referred to by Chinese and Japanese intellectuals as “Westernization.” Fukuzawa Yukichi <span>福</span><span>澤</span><span>諭</span><span>吉</span> (1835&ndash;1901), the foremost Japanese Westernizer of his time, expressed this spirit best when he said, “The final purpose of all my work was to create in Japan a civilized nation, as well equipped in both the arts of war and peace as those of the Western world.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-166" id="calibre_link-206" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> I am fully aware that “modernization” cannot be simply equated with “Westernization.” Historically, however, “Westernization” is a more accurate term than “modernization,” for intellectuals in China and Japan did understand the modernizing process of their countries mainly, if not wholly, in terms of “Westernization.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1286" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As modernization theory has grown more sophisticated since the late 1960s, a major revision has taken place regarding the relationship between modernization and tradition. The early view took tradition to be a hindrance to modern progress; overcoming tradition was therefore seen as a precondition for modernization. However, accumulation of case studies of the so-called developing countries such as India, Thailand, Turkey, etc., began to shed new light on the role of tradition in the process of modernization. A study of the political development in modern India has led Lloyd and Suzanne Rudolph to recognize that complex interrelationship of tradition and modernity. As they powerfully expressed, “The assumption that modernity and tradition are radically contradictory rests on a misdiagnosis of tradition as it is found in traditional societies, a misunderstanding of modernity as it is found in modern societies, and a misapprehension of the relationship between them.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-167" id="calibre_link-207" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> This insightful observation has been further confirmed by many later studies of other aspects of India.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-168" id="calibre_link-208" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> With this new understanding of the relationship between modernization and tradition, we now turn to the “predicament of modernization” in China.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>China’s failure and Japan’s success in modernization have long puzzled scholars. Since the 1930s, if not earlier, various interesting theories have been formulated to explain the vast differences in the modernizing processes of the two East Asian countries. Then, in the 1960s and 1970s, Taiwan and Hong Kong emerged, along with South Korea and Singapore, as East Asia’s “four little dragons.” Taiwan’s success in economic development not only facilitated the growth of a pluralistic society but, more significantly, also led to political liberalization in the 1980s, thereby providing modernization theory with a rare but remarkable example. Since both Taiwan and Hong Kong have also grown out of the bedrock of Chinese civilization, their success with modernization further complicates the case regarding China’s transition from tradition to modernity as a whole.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Needless to say, this is no place to review in a comprehensive manner the problem of China’s modernization. Instead, the present essay proposes to single out for scrutiny one particular strand from the web of ideology in twentieth-century China. By this, I refer to what may be called the “fetishism of revolution.” What follows is primarily a study in the history of ideas&mdash;not ideas pure and simple in their autonomous realm but ideas with grave social and political consequences.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1278" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>A change-oriented mentality has dominated China since the turn of the century. As a result, the Chinese political mentality in the twentieth century may be characterized as a process of radicalization at ever-accelerating speed.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-169" id="calibre_link-209" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> By its own internal logic, radicalization must lead to the advocacy of “revolution,” the most radical of all radical ideas. Let us begin with the concept of “revolution” in modern Chinese political discourse. The Chinese term <i class="calibre9">geming</i> <span>革</span><span>命</span> (<i class="calibre9">kakumei</i> in Japanese) in classical texts means literally “Change of the Mandate of Heaven,” referring to the “dynastic overthrow.” As Liang Qichao pointed out in his 1902 essay on revolution, it was Japanese scholars who first used the Chinese classical <i class="calibre9">geming</i> (<i class="calibre9">kakumei</i>) to translate the English word “revolution.” Though a professed reformist himself, Liang nevertheless clearly recognized that what China then needed was a thoroughgoing and full-scale “revolution” in the sense of “fundamental transformation.” Neither “dynastic overthrow” of the traditional type nor piecemeal changes would be of much help. To translate “revolution” as <i class="calibre9">geming</i> or <i class="calibre9">kakumei</i> was therefore a serious misinterpretation. Of all the “dynastic overthrows” in Europe, why should historians only single out the English Revolution of 1688 and the French Revolution of 1789 as worthy of the name? Liang said this was because in both cases, England and France had been fundamentally transformed as a result. Thus, in Liang’s 1902 essay, perhaps the very first one ever written on the subject by a Chinese author, revolution was already recognized as a value central to modernity. Revolution, in his own words, is “an honorific name standing for civilization, nobility and loftiness.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-170" id="calibre_link-210" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>On the side of the revolutionaries, we may take Zou Rong <span>鄒</span><span>容</span> (1885&ndash;1905)’s powerful propagandistic pamphlet, <i class="calibre9">Geming jun</i> <span>革</span><span>命</span><span>軍</span> (The Revolutionary Army; 1903), as a typical example. In this pamphlet, the word “revolution” was used in two different senses, one narrow and one broad. In the narrow sense, it was to be understood as the overthrow of the Manchu dynasty, and in the broad sense, as the founding of a new republic on the American and French models. This double meaning of revolution&mdash;actually the two sides of the same coin&mdash;was shared by practically all the revolutionaries of the time. In contrast to Liang Qichao’s rather detached praise of “revolution,” the revolutionaries’ enthusiasm for “revolution” was unbounded. To quote the words of Zou Rong:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Sweep away thousands of years of despotism, cast off thousands of years of slavishness, exterminate the five million bestial Manchus, wash away the humiliation of 260 years of oppression and sorrows, cruelty and tyranny, turn the Chinese soil into a clean land and all the sons and grandsons of the Yellow Emperor into George Washingtons. Then we may rise from death and return to life, retrieve our souls; come out of the eighteenth layer of hell and ascend to the thirty-third layer of heaven…and reach the highest honor of having one single great incomparable aim called revolution. Oh, how exalted is revolution! Oh, how supreme is revolution!<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-171" id="calibre_link-211" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1088" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In this passage, we can detect not only a call for violence but also an implicit rejection of tradition, both of which were to become increasingly entangled with the idea of revolution in later generations. It is true that in the remainder of the pamphlet, Zou Rong did emphasize that the aim of the revolution was to build an independent, free, and democratic China comparable to America and France. To that extent, he was indeed concerned with what we now call modernization or, more precisely, Westernization. However, what he could not have possibly foreseen was that given the dead weight of China’s long tradition, the revolution was to remain unfinished for a whole century. Moreover, the destructive violence of revolution once set in motion was to consume the energy of the Chinese people one way or another to such a degree that the constructive work of modernization would have to be postponed indefinitely. Thus, from the very beginning, there were already clear indications that the tension between revolution and modernization in China was such that it was almost destined, as it were, to result in a radical disjunction.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-172" id="calibre_link-212" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> As well observed by a historian of the Revolution of 1911, “What the radicals of the day did was to introduce the whole idea of revolution and set the general style of left-wing student politics for the next forty years. Their combination of nationalistic, visionary dreams, institutional inexperience, and impatient radicalism was repeated in successive appeal up to the time of the Communist victory.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-173" id="calibre_link-213" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> Now, let us move to the next important revolutionary stage, the May Fourth Movement of 1919.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>During the May Fourth Period, roughly from 1917 to 1923, the idea of revolution underwent two interrelated developments. First, unlike early revolutionaries, May Fourth intellectuals were more concerned with the realm of ideas and values than that of politics and institutions, at least in the initial stage of the movement. As a result, the notion of revolution ramified in all directions. As a matter of fact, the May Fourth Movement not only began in 1917 with a “literary revolution” but has also been generally characterized as an “intellectual revolution.” During this period, the term “revolution” was indiscriminately applied to a great variety of subjects such as “social revolution,” “moral revolution,” “family revolution,” “marriage revolution,” “revolution in ethics,” etc. Second, as every aspect of the Chinese tradition was called into question by the critical spirit of the May Fourth Movement, a mentality in iconoclastic antitraditionalism was being gradually formed. As Chen Duxiu <span>陳</span><span>獨</span><span>秀</span> (1879&ndash;1942) wrote in 1919 on behalf of the famous magazine, <i class="calibre9">New Youth</i>: “Our magazine has been accused of committing these crimes: destroying Confucianism, destroying moral norms, destroying national essence, destroying woman’s chastity, destroying old ethics, destroying old arts, destroying old religions, destroying old literature, destroying old politics, etc. To these charges, we, as members of the magazine, must plead guilty.” He further explained that <i class="calibre9">New Youth</i> had no alternative but to commit these “crimes” to pave the way for the advent of Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science, who “can cure the dark maladies in Chinese politics, morality, learning, and thought.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-174" id="calibre_link-214" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup> True to the spirit of the Enlightenment, which had exerted a shaping influence on his mind, Chen called for the systematic eradication of idols: “All false and irrational beliefs in our tradition&mdash;religious, political, ethical, et cetera&mdash;are ‘idols’ and must be destroyed. Otherwise, universal truth can never be deeply implanted in our minds.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-175" id="calibre_link-215" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To be fair to Chen Duxiu, he was not really so negative about the Chinese tradition as these iconoclastic writings seem to indicate. However, in 1919, he was already sufficiently radicalized to seek a sharp break with China’s past. Thus, he and other May Fourth leaders, notably Lu Xun <span>魯</span><span>迅</span> (1881&ndash;1936) and, to a lesser degree, Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962), must be held responsible for importing to China the idea that demolition of tradition is the precondition for modernization. I used the word “importing” advisedly, for it turns out to be none other than the Enlightenment notion of rationality and modernity as embodied in the French Revolution. Recently, a philosopher of science aptly called it “the myth of the clean slate” in the sense that “Any new construction is truly rational only if it demolishes all that was there before and starts from scratch.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-176" id="calibre_link-216" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> It was this myth, I would argue, that transformed the idea of revolution in twentieth-century China in a fundamental way.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1254" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Finally, the impact of the Russian Revolution on the Chinese intelligentsia cannot be overestimated. It was the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism that contributed more than anything else to the growth of what I call the “fetishism of revolution” in China. Needless to say, I owe the term “fetishism” to Marx. When he tried to explain the mysterious character of commodity as a value in itself, Marx found it necessary to turn to “the mist-enveloped regions of the religious world” for an analogy. “In that world,” Marx said, in <i class="calibre9">Das Kapital</i>, volume 1, “the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life, and entering into relation both with one another and the human race.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-177" id="calibre_link-217" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> “Fetishism” to Marx was one of such mental productions. Without denying the obvious fact that every actual revolution in the modern age had its material component, I wish to emphasize that revolution as an idea is first and foremost the creation of the mind traceable to the Enlightenment and the French Revolution.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-178" id="calibre_link-218" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> Having traced the concept of revolution in the history of Western political thought, Steven B. Smith identified Emmanuel Kant as the first modern philosophical spokesman of revolution. As he pointed out, “From Kant onward the concept of revolution acquired an almost transcendental significance that later thinkers would transmute into an idea of historical inevitability. Starting with Kant but proceeding in an unbroken line from Hegel to Marx, from Lenin and Trotsky to Mao Zedong, revolution became a kind of sacred duty undertaken by selfless men acting to fulfill the conditions of reason and freedom.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-179" id="calibre_link-219" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> Now let me briefly explain some of the ways in which the Russian Revolution helped Chinese revolutionaries to grasp “the transcendental significance” and the “sacredness” of revolution, thereby contributing to the rise of the fetishism of revolution.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To begin with, according to Marxism-Leninism, the socialist revolution was indeed a “historical inevitability” based on the idea of “iron laws” that govern social change. The very notion of “scientific laws” as implied in what Engels called “scientific socialism” proved to be particularly attractive to radical intellectuals of the May Fourth generation, who generally fell under the spell of scientism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-180" id="calibre_link-220" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> Moreover, politically, with the end of the monarchy, the traditional idea of the Mandate of Heaven could no longer function as a base of legitimation. It was therefore quite natural for “historical inevitability” or “scientific laws of social change” to fill the empty space recently vacated by the Mandate of Heaven.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1089" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Next, to carry out the socialist revolution was a “sacred duty” because, according to Marxism, it fought for the greatest and most just cause in the entire history of mankind, namely, the liberation of the most miserably exploited and oppressed proletariat class. The moral claim also suited the spiritual needs of May Fourth radicals admirably well through a few theoretical twists. First, although the number of Chinese industrial workers was extremely small during the May Fourth Period,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-181" id="calibre_link-221" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> the Chinese “proletariat” could nevertheless count on hundreds of millions of peasants as its faithful allies as they undoubtedly constituted the miserably exploited and oppressed class in China. Second, in light of Lenin’s theory of imperialism, the entire Chinese “people” could well be perceived as being recklessly exploited and oppressed by Western powers. Third, on the side of revolutionary practice, mention must also be made of the moral passions that sustained the Chinese search for the ideal of revolution. During the May Fourth Period, there was a great explosion of moral passions in China. First, May Fourth intellectuals had been brought up under Confucian education, which, among other things, also taught that it was the primary duty of the elite to be always concerned with the well-being of the common people. There can be no doubt that the sufferings endured by the Chinese since the turn of the century touched their hearts very deeply. Second, moral passion was also generated by the rising tide of Chinese nationalism at this time. We must not forget that the demonstration in Beijing on May 4, 1919, was directly triggered by the strong patriotic feelings of the students. In terms of origins, these moral passions had nothing to do with socialist revolution as an international movement. However, later they were all skillfully manipulated by Chinese Marxists to advance their own cause.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>I am inclined to think that the combined forces generated by both the “scientific” laws of history and the moral passions helped greatly to sacralize the idea of revolution in China. It is true that to justify revolution on scientific and moral grounds at the same time seems to involve a self-contradiction. However, the contradiction turned out to be also the very strength of Marxism. As keenly observed by Michael Polanyi:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Alleged scientific assertions, which are accepted as such because they satisfy moral passions, will excite these passions further, and thus lend increased convincing power to scientific affirmations in questions&mdash;and so on, indefinitely. Moreover, such a dynamo-objective coupling is also potent in its own defense. Any criticism of its scientific part is rebutted by the moral passions behind it, while any moral objections to it are coldly brushed aside by invoking the inexorable verdict of its scientific findings. Each of the two components, the dynamic and objective, takes it in turn to draw attention away from the other when it is under attack.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-182" id="calibre_link-222" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Thus, from the mid-1920s on, “revolution” became the supreme god in China and criticism would be viewed as blasphemy by not only party revolutionaries but radical intellectuals as well. In post-1949 China, “counterrevolutionary crimes” became the worst of all crimes, for which, following the Soviet example during the Red Terror, penalties would be set according to “revolutionary conscience.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-183" id="calibre_link-223" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1038" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The sudden switch from the French Revolution model to the Russian Revolution model was quite characteristic of the May Fourth mentality, with its penchant for “up-to-date” ideas, values, or institutions in the West. Chen Duxiu, still a great Francophile and advocate of democracy of the Anglo-American type as late as 1919, not only was converted to Marxism but also showed more enthusiasm than anybody else in organizing a Communist Party in China in 1920. Then, with his eyes turning to the latest Western model of political system, Lenin’s “proletarian dictatorship,” he showed no hesitation to dispose of democracy as if it were but a used car.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-184" id="calibre_link-224" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> This switch of models, it may be emphatically noted, marked the beginning of a basic paradigmatic change in the Chinese conception of revolution. In Marxist-Leninist terminology, it has often been referred to as a shift from the “bourgeois revolution” to the “proletarian revolution.” With the collapse of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, however, such a distinction no longer makes much sense today. In view of recent discussions of modern revolution from a global perspective, it seems that one way to understand the switch of models from the French Revolution to the Russian Revolution may be that the repeated frustrations with China’s search for modernity by slavishly imitating the West finally pushed many intellectuals such as Chen Duxiu to the opposite side, namely, that of anti-Westernism. As succinctly stated by Robert N. Bellah:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The rapid social change brought on by Western incursions have had traumatic consequences for almost all the societies on the receiving end. They have come to desire many features of Western society at the same time that they deeply resent the disruption they have experienced and the sense of futility with respect to many of their efforts to catch up with the West. Often they have engaged in “anti-Western Westernization,” carrying out drastic social change under the aegis of an avowedly anti-Western ideology. Communism is only the most vivid example of this trend.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-185" id="calibre_link-225" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Intellectuals such as Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao <span>李</span><span>大</span><span>釗</span> (1888&ndash;1927) turned anti-Western because they now identified the West with imperialism, which, they believed, was ultimately responsible for China’s poverty and misery. However, the final goal of the new revolution they were advocating was not really different from that of the old. It remained to be catching up to the Western mode. (“Overtaking England and Catching Up with America” was still Mao’s favorite slogan in the 1950s.) The only difference is that their imitation of the West was often hidden behind the linguistic veil of a furious anti-Westernism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1079" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Now returning to the central theme of this essay, I wish to point out that this redefining of revolution on the Russian model is significant in two important ways: First, linking the revolution in China to the Marxist-Leninist idea of World Revolution gave Chinese revolutionaries a sense of a “sacred” mission heretofore unknown to them. Speaking of the nationalist revolution he was espousing in 1924, Dr. Sun Yat-sen remarked that it was the “great responsibility” placed upon us Chinese by Heaven.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-186" id="calibre_link-226" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> Obviously, Sun’s revolutionary passion must have been aroused by his reading of a famous passage in the <i class="calibre9">Mencius</i> (6B.15). Now, with a Leninist twist, the new generation of revolutionaries could easily appropriate this Mencian moral passion for its own use. Indeed, a revolutionary would feel it morally very edifying to be assured that he was fighting for the liberation of the oppressed classes of not only his own country but the entire world. World Revolution was thus perceived as the “great responsibility” placed upon him by history. Second, with the task of revolution expanded to overthrowing not only the Chinese past (the so-called feudalism) but also the Western present (“capitalism-imperialism”), revolution was no longer something that could be finished in a short period of time as previously understood. Thus, in 1927 at the latest, the Marxist idea of “permanent revolution” was already formally adopted by the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Qu Qiubai <span>瞿</span><span>秋</span><span>白</span> (1899&ndash;1835).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-187" id="calibre_link-227" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup> Absolutely sacralized on the one hand and almost immortalized on the other, the idea of revolution was bound to develop a very uneasy relationship with the idea of modernization, to which we now turn.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>According to modernization theory, modernization is continuous with revolution in non-Western societies: the former begins when the latter ends. As David Kopf points out, “non-Western modernization has been dominated from the 1960’s by present-minded social scientists who tend to date the Herculean transformation of mobility and mobilization from year one of post-independence.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-188" id="calibre_link-228" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> This perhaps resulted from the fact that earlier studies of modernization were limited to societies in Asia and Africa that had newly attained political independence from colonial rule. In reality, however, the relationship of modernization to revolution is too complex to lend itself to facile generalizations. Even in postcolonial new states, this relationship also varied from case to case. It is often difficult, if not impossible, to draw a clear-cut line temporally separating revolution from modernization. This is vividly shown in the slogan current in Indonesia during the 1960s: “The Revolution Is Unfinished!”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-189" id="calibre_link-229" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup> A Chinese reader will be quick to point out that it was none other than Sun Yat-sen who first coined this famous slogan. Here lies the very root of the predicament of China’s modernization. As long as revolution was perceived as “unfinished,” no serious and systematic work in modernization could get started in China. The reason is not far to seek. For one thing, revolution is, by definition, destructive in nature, whereas modernization is, in essence, constructive, involving central state and society building; destroying and constructing cannot be carried out at the same time.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1140" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the long run, however, the fetishism of revolution proved to be a far more formidable enemy of modernization than revolution itself. Fetish-worshipers of revolution are people who are so completely attached to the idea of revolution that they cannot find any other meaning or purpose in life than the very thought that they are undertaking the sacred duty of revolution, real or imaginary. Some signs of uneasiness between the fetishism of revolution and modernization already began to show themselves in the late 1920s when the Nationalist revolution succeeded and the Nationalist Government was set up in Nanjing. Fetish-worshipers of revolution displayed a profound hostility toward the program of political modernization&mdash;constitutional democracy&mdash;vigorously advocated by liberal critics of the Nationalist “party-dictatorship.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-190" id="calibre_link-230" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> This was the beginning of the alienation of the intellectuals from the Nationalist regime, which was only to be further accentuated by the indoctrination policy known as Danghua Jiaoyu (<span>黨</span><span>化</span><span>教</span><span>育</span>, Party-ized Education).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-191" id="calibre_link-231" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup> However, since there was a considerable number of modernizers within the Nationalist Party, the Nanjing government did achieve a degree of state building. Moreover, the dissipation of revolutionary spirit in the Nationalist Party after 1928, though generally considered a weakness, also turned out to be virtue in hindsight, because it prevented the Nanjing Government from engaging in the unending violence of revolution to destroy the original social organization. As a result, there was a limited space for the traditional society to gradually transform itself into what may be called “civil society.” As John K. Fairbank wrote in his last book: “Without the devastating Japanese invasion, the Nanjing government might gradually have led the way in China’s modernization. As it turned out, however, resisting Japan gave Mao and the Chinese Communist Party their chance to establish a new autocratic power in the countryside, excluding the elements of a nascent urban civil society that were still developing under the Nationalists.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-192" id="calibre_link-232" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup> The truth is that the fetishism of revolution under the Nationalists, though clearly visible, was neither pervasive enough nor powerful enough to stop modernization completely.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The fetishism of revolution was in full swing in China between 1949 and 1976 under the personal guidance of Mao Zedong (1893&ndash;1976), who was nothing if not the Chinese revolution incarnate. He was a genius in destruction and, once in power, immediately began to demolish the Chinese tradition from the ground up in the name of revolution. As well summed up by Ambrose King:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The Chinese Communist party had struggled to effect a revolutionary change in the 1950s and 1960s by using “organization” to destroy and replace the institutional structure of the Chinese traditional social system. The party-state structured the society into an all-inclusive, functional collectivity called <i class="calibre9">danwei</i> <span>單</span><span>位</span>. In mainland China, almost every working adult belongs to a <i class="calibre9">danwei</i> which provides its members with extensive goods and services. The relation between the individual and <i class="calibre9">danwei</i> is near total and the high degree of individual dependency on the <i class="calibre9">danwei</i> has created a “culture of organized dependency,” as [Andrew G.] Walder demonstrated. The <i class="calibre9">danwei</i> refers to the “work-unit” with which an individual is totally identified. A person without a <i class="calibre9">danwei</i> is a person without identity altogether. But, it must be emphatically noted, this is only the beginning not the end of the Maoist revolution. <sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-193" id="calibre_link-233" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1318" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In a recent book on Mao’s early and late life by Li Rui <span>李</span><span>銳</span> (1917&ndash;), who served as Mao’s secretary during the 1950s, there is a great deal of revealing evidence about his frantic fetishism for revolution.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-194" id="calibre_link-234" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup> In the first place, he believed that the world, both human and natural, is always filled with contradictions and oppositions, with new ones constantly replacing old ones. Therefore struggle (i.e., revolution) must never come to an end. In the second place, the revolution he was fighting for was not confined to China but must extend to the whole world. It was to be measured not in years or decades, but centuries. In the third place, by revolution, he meant creating chaos by violence. In the fourth place, he made no distinction between economic construction and violent revolution. This was the fundamental assumption of his Great Leap Forward of 1958. This point is also fully borne out by his published works. For instance, he said in January 1958, “In making revolution one must strike while the iron is hot&mdash;one revolution must follow another, the revolution must be continually advanced.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-195" id="calibre_link-235" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup> It is extremely revealing that here he is actually talking about the Great Leap Forward, not revolution. But who could possibly tell the difference if these words were taken out of their original context? In the fifth place, he was thoroughly negative about the Chinese tradition and considered his destructive work far from being completed. In 1959, he repeatedly expressed his determination to abolish the last of the Chinese institutions&mdash;the family. This horrified most of his comrades who were present, particularly Marshall Zhu De <span>朱</span><span>德</span> (1886&ndash;1976). Finally, he believed that by relying on iron will and revolutionary means, he could translate any utopia, Chinese or foreign, ancient or modern, into a reality in China. Here he pushed “the myth of the clean slate” to its illogical end. Hegel has the following interesting description of what he calls “negative will” or “negative freedom”:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>This [negative freedom] is the freedom of the void which rises to a passion and takes shape in the world; while still remaining theoretical, it takes shape in religion as the Hindu fanaticism of pure contemplation, but when it turns to actual practice, it takes shape in religion and politics alike as the fanaticism of destruction&mdash;the destruction of the whole subsisting social order&mdash;as the elimination of individuals who are objects of suspicion to and social order, and the annihilation of any organization which tries to rise anew from the ruins. Only in destroying something does this negative will possess the feeling of itself as existent. Of course it imagines that it is willing some positive state of affairs, such as universal equality or universal religious life, but in fact it does not will that this shall be positively actualized, and for this reason: such actuality leads at once to some sort of order, to a particularization of organizations and individuals alike; while it is precisely out of the annihilation of particularity and objective characterization that the self-consciousness of this negative freedom proceeds. Consequently, what negative freedom intends to will can never be anything in itself but an abstract idea, and giving effect to the idea can only be the fury of destruction.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-196" id="calibre_link-236" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1130" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Mao answers to this description perfectly. The “abstract idea” that his negative will willed, I submit, was none other than the fetishism of revolution. No wonder the Four Modernizations could not really get started until after Mao’s departure from the world.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>But what is truly terrifying is that Mao was not alone in this fetish-worship of revolution. According to Li Rui, he was surrounded by many apparently “true believers,” including as distinguished a scientist as Qian Xuesen <span>錢</span><span>學</span><span>森</span> (1911&ndash;2009). In launching the Great Leap Forward, Mao told Li, he was chiefly influenced by Qian, who assured him that solar energy is unlimited and, if well utilized, it will be entirely possible to grow “ten thousand catties of grain or more per <i class="calibre9">mou</i> (Chinese acre).”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-197" id="calibre_link-237" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup> In China, it may be further pointed out, fetishism of revolution was wedded to scientism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To conclude, I must honestly admit, I cannot pretend to know why Taiwan and Hong Kong have both succeeded in modernization. I merely wish to point out one irrefutable fact, namely, for reasons too obvious to be stated, both societies have the good fortune of remaining untouched by the violence of revolution. Modernization cannot even begin if there is nothing to be modernized. In this sense, modernization and tradition must of necessity imply each other. Sixty years ago, a distinguished British scholar had this advice for China:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Much talk of the Westernization of China is remote from reality. [T]hough a nation may borrow its tools from abroad, for the energy to handle them it must look within…. It is in herself alone, in her own historical culture, rediscovered and reinterpreted in light of her modern requirement, that China will find the dynamic which she needs. The most fundamental achievements of her revolution are still to come. The problem is to translate political rejuvenation in practical terms of social institutions, and to build with a modern technique, but on Chinese foundations.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-198" id="calibre_link-238" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>It may still be worthwhile to take heed of this unusually wise counsel.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1274" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">I</span>n his famous <i class="calibre9">Democracy in America</i> (4 vols., 1835&ndash;1840), Alexis de Tocqueville made the following most illuminating observation:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>If ever a democratic republic similar to that of the United States came to be established in a country in which earlier a single man’s power had introduced administrative centralization and had made it something accepted by custom and by law, I have no hesitation in saying that in such a republic despotism would become more intolerable than in any of the absolute monarchies of Europe. One would have to go over into Asia to find anything with which to compare it.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-583" id="calibre_link-627" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Needless to say, Tocqueville had France in mind when he spoke these words, which, however, have turned out to be startlingly prophetic regarding twentieth-century China. As we all know, China was the first country in Asia to abolish a highly centralized imperial system&mdash;one fully two millennia old&mdash;and establish in its place a republican form of government. On the other hand, exactly as Tocqueville had predicted, Chinese despotism in the twentieth century has indeed grown ever more intolerable on the waves of one revolution after another.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1090" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In this chapter, however, I propose to discuss, not the reality of Chinese despotism, but the idea of democracy. The very fact that China, in 1912, was able to cast off its imperial past and adopt a republican system based primarily on the American model testifies unmistakably to the power of democracy as the political faith of the Chinese revolutionary elite. This simple but fascinating fact may serve well as the starting point of our inquiry into the vicissitudes of the idea of democracy in the political and intellectual history of twentieth-century China. This fact is fascinating because it raises a number of thought-provoking questions deserving further exploration. To mention just a few: Why did so many Chinese intellectuals at the turn of the century, whose national history knew no other political model than hereditary monarchy after China’s first unification in 221 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>, become so readily attracted to the idea of democracy? Since the May Fourth Period, Confucianism has been viewed as a major intellectual obstacle to China’s democratization. As Chen Duxiu <span>陳</span><span>獨</span><span>秀</span> (1879&ndash;1942) stated explicitly in 1919, “In order to advocate democracy, we are obliged to oppose Confucianism.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-584" id="calibre_link-628" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> However, it is also an irrefutable fact that most, if not all, of the leading Chinese advocates of democracy at the turn of the century were, each in his own way, committed Confucians, notably Yan Fu <span>嚴</span><span>復</span> (1853&ndash;1921), Kang Youwei <span>康</span><span>有</span><span>為</span> (1858&ndash;1927), Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929), Zhang Binglin <span>章</span><span>炳</span><span>麟</span> (1868&ndash;1936), and Liu Shipei <span>劉</span><span>師</span><span>培</span> (1884&ndash;1919). Such being the case, how are we to account for their great enthusiasm for the creation of a democratic order in China? With the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, the idea of democracy enjoyed, indeed, a strong and auspicious beginning to its career in China. But, ironically, its subsequent career in China has turned out to be marked by frustrations and failures&mdash;at times, even of tragic proportions.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Then a further question inevitably arises: Why was the idea of democracy able to help induce a fundamental change in political structure under the monarchical rule of China’s last dynasty, while it has ceased to function in any meaningful way since the founding of the Republic? The rest of the chapter will address itself to these intriguing questions. Due to limitations of time and space, however, no attempt will be made to deal with them in a general and comprehensive manner. Instead, I shall discuss them by specifically relating the idea of democracy to the elite culture in modern China.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">1</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1056" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>There can be no question that the idea of democracy is of Western origin, traceable to ancient Greece. Even if we grant the possibility of some remote Phoenician influences on the beginning of Greek political wisdom, the historical fact nevertheless remains unaltered that it was in the Athenian polis that the idea of democracy was most fully institutionalized for the first time in the ancient world.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-585" id="calibre_link-629" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> When the idea was imported to China in the late nineteenth century, Chinese scholars showed no intellectual curiosity about its history. Rather, they were enormously interested in its modern institutional expressions as they found them in Britain, France, and the United States. They gave the idea several Chinese names&mdash;including <i class="calibre9">minzhu</i> <span>民</span><span>主</span> (people’s rule), <i class="calibre9">minquan</i> <span>民</span><span>權</span> (people’s power), and <i class="calibre9">minzhi</i> <span>民</span><span>治</span> (government by the people), all of which have survived to this day. However, the first one, <i class="calibre9">minzhu</i>, is now generally accepted as the standard Chinese translation of the Western term “democracy.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It is significant that in the late nineteenth century, open-minded Confucian scholars who visited the West for the first time almost invariably returned to China deeply impressed by the ideals and institutions of Western constitutional democracy. A few examples will suffice to illustrate this point. After a two-year trip to the British Isles and Europe in the late 1860s, Wang Tao <span>王</span><span>韜</span> (1828&ndash;1897), the Chinese assistant to James Legge in the English translation of the Confucian classics, gave the following characterization of the British government and people:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The real strength of England, however, lies in the fact that there is a sympathetic understanding between the governing and governed, a close relationship between the ruler and the people…. My observation is that the daily domestic political life of England actually embodies the traditional ideals of our ancient Golden Age. In official appointments the method of recommendation and election is practiced, but the candidates must be well known, of good character and achievements before they can be promoted to a position over the people…. And moreover the principle of majority rule is adhered to in order to show impartibility…. The English people are likewise public-spirited and law-abiding: the laws and regulations are hung up high (for everyone to see), and no one dares violate them.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-586" id="calibre_link-630" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Later, in 1877, when Yan Fu and Guo Songtao <span>郭</span><span>嵩</span><span>燾</span> (1818&ndash;1891), China’s first ambassador to England, were both in London, they often spent days and nights together discussing differences and similarities in Chinese and Western thought and political institutions. It is interesting to note that both men arrived at essentially the same conclusions as Wang Tao’s, apparently without being aware of the latter’s writings. In the end, Guo heartily agreed with Yan Fu’s observation that “the reason why England and other countries of Europe are wealthy and strong is that impartial justice (<i class="calibre9">gongli</i> <span>公</span><span>理</span>) is daily extended. Here is the ultimate source.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-587" id="calibre_link-631" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>My last example is Xue Fucheng <span>薛</span><span>福</span><span>成</span> (1888&ndash;1894), who was concurrently China’s minister to England, France, Italy, and Belgium from 1890 to 1894. In the May 1, 1890, entry of his diary, he wrote:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1203" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Formerly Guo Songtao frequently praised the merits of the governmental administration and popular customs of the West, which caused him to suffer criticism and ostracism from scholars who like to criticize others. I was also slightly surprised at the exaggeration of his words, which I checked with Chen Lanbin <span>陳</span><span>蘭</span><span>彬</span> [China’s envoy to the United States in the 1870s]…who said that his statement was correct. This time when I came to Europe and traveled from Paris to London I began to believe that the statements of Guo Songtao could be verified in the parliaments, schools, prisons, hospitals, and streets.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Later in the same entry, he also praised the United States highly, saying, “America is like the time of the Golden Age of Ancient China.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-588" id="calibre_link-632" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>I take the above examples as illustrative of the initial response of the Confucian elite to the idea of democracy, for all of them were deeply committed to Confucian values and therefore expressed their appreciative understanding of Western democratic ideals and institutions from a distinctly Confucian point of view. It is particularly revealing that Wang Tao and Xue Fucheng praised, respectively, but independently of each other, England and the United States in terms of the Golden Age in China’s high antiquity. This would seem to suggest that they saw the democratic West as the Second Coming of the Confucian Golden Age. This is indeed the highest possible tribute the traditional Confucian elite could have paid to the idea of democracy. It is true that in their own times, they constituted only a small minority and therefore can by no means be taken as representative of the Confucian elite as a whole. With the advantage of hindsight, however, we also happen to know that they were a “creative minority” charting the future of China.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1271" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The equation of the Confucian idea of a Golden Age with that of Western democracy was soon to undergo a dexterous twist in the hands of Confucian reformers. When Kang Youwei became acquainted with the ideas and institutions of Western democracy by reading journalism in the 1880s, he began to develop a theory that may be called the indigenous genesis of democracy in ancient China. He distinguished three types of government in Chinese history, namely, “the people’s rule” (<i class="calibre9">minzhu</i>), “joint rule of monarch and people” (<i class="calibre9">junmin gongzhi</i> <span>君</span><span>民</span><span>共</span><span>治</span>), and “autocracy” (<i class="calibre9">zhuanzhi</i> <span>專</span><span>制</span>). The first type, <i class="calibre9">minzhu</i>, was actualized during the time of the legendary sage-emperors Yao and Shun. It was the highest and most perfect form of democracy. He attributed the second type, <i class="calibre9">junmin gongzhi</i>, to the reign of King Wen of the Zhou dynasty. It was a sort of constitutional monarchy. The last type, <i class="calibre9">zhuanzhi</i>, the lowest and worst possible form of government, was what China had practiced since its unification under the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty in 221 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> By way of extensive exegesis of certain Confucian texts, Kang came to the conclusion that Confucius was a most enthusiastic advocate of democracy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-589" id="calibre_link-633" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> It may be noted in this connection that it was Wang Tao who first identified these three forms of state in Europe, which he called, respectively, <i class="calibre9">minzhu guo</i>, or democracy; <i class="calibre9">junzhu guo</i> <span>君</span><span>主</span><span>國</span>, or monarchy; and <i class="calibre9">junmin gongzhu guo</i> <span>君</span><span>民</span><span>共</span><span>主</span><span>國</span>, or constitutional monarchy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-590" id="calibre_link-634" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> Quite possibly, Kang may have been initially inspired by Wang’s writing and built his theory on its basis. Thus, Kang introduced a completely new paradigm in Chinese intellectual history that dominated Confucian classical scholarship until the May Fourth Period. The paradigm was not only taken over but also greatly extended by his political rivals&mdash;Confucian advocates of a republican revolution. Liu Shipei, for example, wrote a book entitled <i class="calibre9">Zhongguo minyue jingyi</i> <span>中</span><span>國</span><span>民</span><span>約</span><span>精</span><span>義</span> (Essentials of the Chinese Theory of Social Contract) in the early years of the twentieth century, which purports to trace the origins and evolution of democratic ideas in China&mdash;including democracy, equality, freedom, rights, etc.&mdash;from the ancient classics all the way to the philosophical writings of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-591" id="calibre_link-635" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>During the first decade of this century, the influential <i class="calibre9">Guocui xuebao</i> <span>國</span><span>粹</span><span>學</span><span>報</span> (Journal of National Essence), with which Liu Shipei and Zhang Binglin were closely associated, carried numerous learned articles elaborating on this theme. As a result, there gradually formed a climate of opinion among the Confucian elite that democratic ideas had long ago been developed in ancient China by Confucius, Mencius, and other sages independently of the West and that it was the duty of modern Confucians to rediscover and repossess them from the Confucian texts. The following statement by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Founder of the Republic, is worth quoting:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In ancient China there were the abdications of Yao and Shun as well as the changes of the Mandate of Heaven (<i class="calibre9">geming</i> <span>革</span><span>命</span> “revolution”) of King Tang (of the Shang dynasty) and King Wu (of the Zhou dynasty). As for theories, there were such statements [as] “Heaven sees with eyes of its people. Heaven hears with the ears of its people,” “I have indeed heard of the punishment of the outcast named Zhou [i.e., the “bad last ruler” of the Shang dynasty], but I have not heard of any regicide,” and “the people are of supreme importance: the sovereign comes last,” etc. So we cannot say that democratic ideas have been lacking in China. However, what we have are ideas but not institutions.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-592" id="calibre_link-636" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Sun was not a Confucian scholar. As Martin Wilber rightly observes, however, “Sun’s reformist prescriptions seem at all stages of their development to reflect the ideas currently fashionable among the then-radical Chinese intellectuals.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-593" id="calibre_link-637" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> Therefore, this statement may be justifiably taken as representative of the view of the Chinese elite in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The idea of democracy proved to be so attractive to the Chinese elite that they not only adopted it, but went to great lengths to completely naturalize it.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">2</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1091" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>With the beginning of the May Fourth era, the historical findings of the preceding generation with regard to the indigenous origin of democracy in ancient China was rapidly discredited. After 1919, few scholars, if any, would seriously believe that ideas such as “democracy,” “liberty,” “rights,” and “social contract,” when truthfully interpreted in their original context, could be found in the Confucian tradition. Instead of viewing the Confucian classic as a repository of “democratic ideas,” Confucianism was now repudiated as the very ideological cornerstone on which Chinese monarchy had stood from beginning to end. This anti-Confucian sentiment was so powerfully, as well as multifariously, expressed that it would still find a sympathetic echo in many minds today. Thus, we find in modern Chinese intellectual history, two major interpretations regarding the nature of Confucianism that are diametrically opposed to each other. Which one, then, should we follow? A detailed account of this controversy lies beyond the scope of the present chapter.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-594" id="calibre_link-638" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> Suffice it to say that Confucianism is such a complex system of values, beliefs, and ideas and has, moreover, undergone so many historical transformations that it does not easily yield itself to any one-sided characterization no matter how well grounded. Indeed, Confucianism can mean different things not only to different people but also to the same people in different contexts. Chen Duxiu, for example, made the following remark to a friend in his prison cell in the early 1930s:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Every feudal dynasty worshipped Confucius as a sage. The act of worship was inauthentic. Its true purpose was to strengthen dynastic rule…This is the reason that during the May Fourth Movement, we came up with the slogan “Down with Confucius and Sons.” However, intellectually speaking, the sayings of Confucius and Mencius are worth studying. Statements like “The people are of supreme importance; the sovereign comes last” (Mencius) and “In teaching, there should be no distinction of classes” (Confucius) all deserve to be further explored.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-595" id="calibre_link-639" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Clearly, at the time of this conversation, when his radicalism had subsided, he also distinguished Confucianism as state ideology from the true teachings of Confucius, Mencius, and other Confucians, thereby retreating from his earlier position that “Confucianism and monarchy were indissolubly bound.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-596" id="calibre_link-640" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1036" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962), another intellectual leader of the May Fourth Movement, provides us with a slightly different example. He was responsible, more than anyone else, for making the anti-Confucianist battle cry&mdash;“Down with Confucius and Sons”&mdash;a household phrase in China. As a moderate liberal, however, he seemed to recognize from the beginning that Confucianism as state ideology must not be confused with those Confucian values that constituted the core of what he called “the humanistic and rationalistic China.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-597" id="calibre_link-641" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> It is particularly interesting that in many of his English writings, he often emphasized the compatibility of Confucianism with Western liberalism. He was, of course, intellectually sophisticated enough not to make any claim for China’s independent discovery of the idea of democracy in ancient times. Nevertheless, he was bold enough to suggest that certain Confucian ideas and institutions might prove to be capable of furnishing China with a solid foundation on which constitutional democracy could be successfully established.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-598" id="calibre_link-642" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup> In “The Natural Law in the Chinese Tradition” (1953), he further proposed that both the Confucian Canon (Classics) and the Neo-Confucian idea of <i class="calibre9">li</i>, or principle, are more or less comparable to Natural Law in the West, which “ha[s] always played the historical role of a fighting weapon in mankind’s struggle against the injustice and the tyranny of unlimited human authority.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-599" id="calibre_link-643" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> By contrast, he rarely favored Confucianism with such high credit in his Chinese writings, at least not so explicitly and in such a focused way, presumably for fear of making his compatriots too self-complacent to struggle for China’s modernization.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The cases of Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi seem to suggest that in spite of their belligerent anti-Confucianist stance on the surface, at a deeper level of consciousness, their early Confucian breeding, I suspect, may well have in some way helped to predispose them more readily to the idea of democracy. Chen was a most enthusiastic advocate of democracy during this period, and it was he who personified the idea, calling it “Mr. Democracy.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the winter of 1919, John Dewey delivered a lecture on democracy in Beijing. He analyzed the idea using four categories:</span></div>
<div class="numlist"><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;political democracy, including principally constitution and legislative representation;</span></div>
<div class="numlist1"><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;people’s rights, including freedom of speech, press, belief, residence, etc.;</span></div>
<div class="numlist1"><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;social democracy, namely, the abolition of social inequalities; and</span></div>
<div class="numlist1"><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;economic democracy in terms of the equal distribution of wealth.</span></div>
<div class="noindent1"><span><a id="calibre_link-1260" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Chen agreed with Dewey’s analysis completely and supported it with an article entitled “The Basis for the Realization of Democracy,” which appeared in the December 1919 issue of the influential <i class="calibre9">New Youth</i> magazine, together with Dewey’s lecture. He emphatically pointed out that China must follow the British and American models in political democracy, and at the same time, also pay attention to the problem of social and economic democracy, which had yet to be achieved anywhere in the world.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-600" id="calibre_link-644" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> It was probably Chen’s concern with social and economic democracy that led him to the socialist revolution in the decade that immediately followed. Still, his faith in democracy was never completely shaken, though it was temporarily suspended during his revolutionary years. In 1940, he expressed his final views on democracy in a number of letters and essays. He now realized that the so-called proletarian democracy was only a euphemism for totalitarian dictatorship. After six to seven years of deep thinking, he became fully convinced that democracy in any society, capitalist or socialist, must of necessity consist of a parliamentary system, elections, due process of law, and civil rights protecting freedom of thought, speech, the press, association, etc. On the basis of his own political experience, he stressed that “most important of all is the freedom of opposition parties.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-601" id="calibre_link-645" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>What Dewey said in 1919 about democracy probably stayed in the back of Chen’s mind throughout the last two decades of his life. There can be no doubt that Chen’s political, social, and ethical ideas as shown in his published writings through several stages of intellectual development are all, essentially, of Western origin. Unlike late Qing Confucian reformists or revolutionaries such as Kang Youwei and Zhang Binglin, as far as I can judge, Chen does not seem to have ever justified his views by reference to the authority of Chinese classics. Such being the case, then on precisely what grounds are we justified in suggesting that his advocacy of democracy, and for that matter, of socialism (“economic democracy”), may have been helped by his background in the essentially Confucian culture of the Chinese elite? I would like to suggest two possible grounds, one specific and one general. The specific ground is the fact that in his early years, Ch’en first followed Kang Youwei and then shifted to the revolutionary camp of Zhang Binglin and Liu Shipei. Therefore, he was quite familiar with the common discourse of the two Confucian groups discussed earlier. By the May Fourth Period, he must have already dismissed the theory of the Chinese origin of the idea of democracy as nonsense. The possibility cannot be completely ruled out, however, that his initial acceptance of democracy as a value may well have been facilitated through the mediation of the sayings of Confucius and Mencius, such as those quoted by him in the early 1930s.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The general ground is that in traditional Chinese elite culture, Confucian education often inculcates into the minds of the young, along with other values, a sense of justice, social responsibility, human equality, the well-being of the people, etc., which may be regarded as some of the closest Confucian equivalents to Western “civic virtues.” Many late Qing reformers and revolutionaries coming from the Confucian elite background were individuals imbued with this kind of public spiritedness. It was also these Confucian intellectuals who were often susceptible to Western democratic ideas and ideals. In the end, they might reject every established Confucian doctrine, thereby assuming an anti-Confucianist role. Nevertheless, they would still retain the public spiritedness of Confucian origin. Of course, here I am speaking of an ideal type. I would not hesitate to take Chen Duxiu as a concrete illustration, however.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In this sense, we may indeed speak justifiably, with William Theodore de Bary, of a liberal tradition in China, if the term “liberalism” is interpreted liberally without tying it to the Western conception of freedom under law. Having reexamined certain “liberal tendencies” in Neo-Confucianism from Zhu Xi <span>朱</span><span>熹</span> (1130&ndash;1200) to Huang Zongxi <span>黃</span><span>宗</span><span>羲</span> (1610&ndash;1695), de Bary deplores that these tendencies had become obscured by the May Fourth Period. As a result, many young Chinese of the May Fourth generation viewed Neo-Confucianism as “a repressive, reactionary system.” The following comment by de Bary’s is insightful:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1266" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Proponents of the New Culture movement in the twenties, whose newly Westernized education had made a sharp break with classical Confucian learning, their own thought processes may well have remained unconsciously subject to lingering Neo-Confucian influences. As members of what was still a privileged intellectual elite, they easily identified Western-style liberalism with the autonomy of the self which had already been a value in the earlier literati culture.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-602" id="calibre_link-646" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>I heartily agree with this observation. It also lends considerable support to my contention that, with all its imperfections, Chinese elite culture has proven to be, paradoxically, more receptive than hostile to the idea of democracy.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">3</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>With the founding of the Republic in 1912, Confucianism ceased to serve as the philosophical foundation of China’s political system. Before the advent of totalitarian dictatorship on the Stalinist model in 1949, the Chinese intellectual elite generally regarded constitutional democracy as the only acceptable norm of politics. Even as late as 1957, when Chinese intellectuals were urged to voice criticisms by Mao, they still had the audacity to demand the reestablishment of parliamentary systems and multiparty politics, only to be brutally suppressed as “rightists.” This is clearly the legacy of the May Fourth Movement, as many of these “rightists” were students of the May Fourth generation.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If Confucianism has become politically marginalized almost to the point of irrelevance in China since the May Fourth Period, can we say the same about it culturally? Undeniably, the influence of Confucianism in cultural and social realms has also been receding in the twentieth century. However, Confucian values and ideas have permeated Chinese everyday life for so many centuries that it is inconceivable that they can be eradicated in a span of several decades, even by revolutionary violence. Though considerably modified, and perhaps also somewhat distorted, Confucianism as a whole must nevertheless be taken seriously as a major component of Chinese culture at both the elite and popular levels. As Chinese society (as opposed to the state) has been gradually but ever increasingly regaining its vitality in recent years, signs are not lacking that Confucian culture is beginning to reemerge in a modern dress.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1195" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In late Ming China, as despotism was growing increasingly intolerable, many members of the Confucian elite abandoned their hopes concerning the imperial state above and began to focus their attention on opening up and expanding cultural and social space below. Some founded private academies, others devoted their lives to building local communities in various forms (including the well-known <i class="calibre9">xiangyue</i> <span>鄉</span><span>約</span>, or community compacts), and still others threw themselves into the business world. As a result, a profound reorientation was also taking place in Confucian social and political philosophy. For example, between 1600 and 1800, a number of leading Confucian thinkers advocated the primacy of “the private” over “the public” in the sense that private individuals can take care of their own interests much more effectively than the emperor could on their behalf. There was also a growing emphasis on the idea that wealth must remain in the hands of those who created it, and not be entrusted to the state treasury.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-603" id="calibre_link-647" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> Today, we seem to be witnessing a recurrence of this late Ming historical process in China.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If both Confucianism in its modern form and democracy are to coexist in China in, it is hoped, a not too distant future&mdash;as is already beginning to happen in Taiwan&mdash;how will the two relate to each other? In this connection, I would like to borrow a new concept developed by John Rawls after the appearance of his 1971 classic, <i class="calibre9">A Theory of Justice</i>. I refer to the concept of a “comprehensive doctrine.” In <i class="calibre9">Political Liberalism</i>, Rawls says:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>An essential feature of a well-ordered society associated with justice as fairness is that all its citizens endorse this conception on the basis of what I now call a comprehensive philosophical doctrine…. Now the serious problem is this: A modern democratic society is characterized not simply by a pluralism of comprehensive religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines, but by a pluralism of incompatible yet reasonable comprehensive doctrines. No one of these doctrines is affirmed by citizens generally. Nor should one expect that in the foreseeable future one of them or some other reasonable doctrine, will ever be affirmed by all, or nearly all, citizens. Political liberalism assumes that, for political purposes, a plurality of reasonable yet incompatible comprehensive doctrines is the normal result of the exercise of human reason within the framework of the free institutions of a constitutional democratic regime. Political liberalism also supposes that a reasonable comprehensive doctrine does not reject the essentials of a democratic regime.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-604" id="calibre_link-648" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1367" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Confucianism in its modern form clearly qualifies as a “comprehensive doctrine” as here described. In traditional China, theoretically speaking, political life was guided by Confucian ethical principles. As Confucius said: “Guide them by edicts, keep them in line with punishments, and the common people will stay out of trouble but will have no sense of shame. Guide them by virtue, keep them in line with the rites, and they will, besides having a sense of shame, reform themselves.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-605" id="calibre_link-649" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> “Edicts” and “punishments” refer to legal principles, whereas “virtues” and “rites” refer to ethical ones. The sage preferred the latter. By contrast, the political tradition of the West from its inception in the Greek polis has followed legal principles.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-606" id="calibre_link-650" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> By embracing the Western idea of constitutional democracy, the Chinese intellectual elite actually abandoned the traditional “rule of virtue” for the “rule of law.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-607" id="calibre_link-651" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup> This led inevitably to the end of Confucianism as a dominating political force.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Dissociated from political power, Confucianism in its modern form no longer occupies any privileged position and therefore becomes one of the comprehensive doctrines. Rawls, however, further distinguishes “reasonable comprehensive doctrines” from “unreasonable” ones. Unreasonable doctrines could undermine the unity and justice of a constitutional democratic regime and therefore must be contained. He does not specify, but we can reasonably assume, that they refer to certain forms of religious fundamentalism and, perhaps, also to some of the modern totalitarian ideologies.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-608" id="calibre_link-652" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> On the other hand, he deliberately defines the idea of “reasonable comprehensive doctrine” in a loose way so that it could accommodate as many religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines as possible. His examples include utilitarianism, Kant’s moral philosophy with its ideal of autonomy, as well as “all the main historical religions.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-609" id="calibre_link-653" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup> In this light, Confucianism is not only a “comprehensive doctrine” but also a “reasonable” one at that.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Furthermore, according to Rawls, a conception of political justice shared by everyone in a democratic regime can be obtained only through an “overlapping consensus” of most, if not all, reasonable comprehensive doctrines. Each reasonable doctrine endorses the conception, but from its own point of view.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-610" id="calibre_link-654" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> This seems to suggest that reasonable comprehensive doctrines as cultural resources contribute positively to the building of a commonly accepted conception of justice in a democratic society. Perhaps this is why he also refers to them as “background culture.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-611" id="calibre_link-655" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup> But not all reasonable comprehensive doctrines in a society can contribute equally to the “overlapping consensus” necessary for the establishment of a democratic order. This is logically implied in the following statement: “there are many reasonable comprehensive doctrines that understand the wider realm of values to be congruent with, or supportive of, or else not in conflict with, political values as these are specified by a political conception of justice for a democratic regime.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-612" id="calibre_link-656" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> If I understand Rawls correctly, then what he says about how reasonable comprehensive doctrines and a conception of justice for a democratic regime are related to each other generally can apply with equal validity to the question of how Confucianism will be related to democracy in China specifically. Of all the reasonable doctrines in the Chinese tradition, Confucianism is clearly the most comprehensive and therefore also has the most to offer a Chinese conception of political justice.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1185" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>I am fully aware that Confucianism and Western liberalism are two entirely different and incommensurable systems of thought, each being the product of its unique historical experience. They cannot be translated into each other’s terms without serious distortions. However, shorn of its accidentally acquired and now outmoded features, on the one hand, and with necessary readjustments to the changed and ever-changing conditions, on the other, the central ideas and principles of Confucianism may be shown to be largely compatible with many of the reasonable comprehensive doctrines of the West, liberalism itself included. Many people have already done valuable work along this line. In concluding this section, however, let me add one more example. Recently, American liberals have turned their attention to the vice of cruelty. Of all the ordinary vices, Judith N. Shklar has chosen to “put cruelty first.” As she expressed so powerfully, “Indeed, hating cruelty, and putting it first, remain a powerful part of the liberal consciousness.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-613" id="calibre_link-657" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup> Following Shklar, Richard Rorty specifically calls our attention to the books of what he calls “liberal ironists” that help us become less cruel. He tells us that both Nabokov and Orwell, each in a way uniquely his own, “met Judith Shklar’s criterion of a liberal: somebody who believes that cruelty is the worst thing we do.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-614" id="calibre_link-658" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Hating cruelty, I must emphatically point out, has also been a powerful part of the Confucian consciousness from the very beginning. Confucius says, “How true is the saying that after a state has been ruled for a hundred years by good men, it is possible to get the better of cruelty and do away with killing.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-615" id="calibre_link-659" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup> This is how Confucius “put cruelty first.” Mencius also characterized Confucius’s and two earlier sages’ profound abhorrence of cruelty in the following words: “Had it been necessary to perpetrate one wrongful deed or to kill one innocent man in order to gain the Empire, none of them would have consented to it.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-616" id="calibre_link-660" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup> Rorty writes of “participative emotion” in the case of Nabokov thus: “the ability to shudder with shame and indignation at the unnecessary death of a child&mdash;a child with whom we have no connection of family, tribe, or class&mdash;is the highest form of emotion that humanity has attained while evolving modern social and political institutions.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-617" id="calibre_link-661" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup> This remark reminds me immediately of a well-known passage of Mencius on human compassion, which may be reproduced, in part, as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>No man is devoid of a heart sensitive to the suffering of others…. Suppose a man were, all of a sudden, to see a young child on the verge of falling into a well. He would certainly be moved to compassion, not because he wanted to get in the good graces of the parents, nor because he wished to win the praise of his fellow villagers or friends, nor yet because he disliked the cry of the child. From this, it can be seen that whoever is devoid of the heart of compassion is not human, whoever is devoid of the heart of shame is not human, whoever is devoid of the heart of courtesy and modesty is not human, and whoever is devoid of the heart of right and wrong is not human.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-618" id="calibre_link-662" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1092" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Here we encounter the earliest Confucian discovery of “the highest form of emotion that humanity has attained.” Space does not allow me to mention numerous Confucian writers of later ages who each had something to say about cruelty and suffering. However, I cannot pass this topic without quoting a few lines from Du Fu <span>杜</span><span>甫</span> (712&ndash;770), China’s greatest poet:</span></div>
<div class="hanging"><span>Behind the red-lacquered gates, wine is left to sour, meat to rot.</span></div>
<div class="hanging1"><span>Outside these gates lie the bones of the frozen and starved.</span></div>
<div class="hanging1"><span>The flourishing and the withered are just a foot apart&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="hanging1"><span>It rends my heart to ponder on it.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-619" id="calibre_link-663" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="noindent1"><span>This great Confucian poet surely deserves to be called a “liberal ironist.”</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">4</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>As shown above, the idea of democracy found its most sympathetic audience in China among the intellectual elite. From the late nineteenth century to 1919, leading advocates of democracy came almost invariably from the intellectual elite with a strong background in Confucian culture. For example, reformers such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, revolutionaries such as Zhang Binglin and Liu Shipei, and May Fourth leaders such as Hu Shih and Chen Duxiu were also top-notch scholars and thinkers holding the highest academic positions in China at one time or another. With the exception of Chen Duxiu, the Confucian elite from the late Qing to the early Republican years generally endorsed the idea of democracy. On the contrary, it is not difficult at all to cite numerous instances showing that conservative Confucians during the same period were strongly opposed to change in general and to democracy in particular. All this suggests is that if the idea of democracy wanted to find a hospitable social space in China, it could only look to the Confucian elite, because other social groups, including merchants and peasants, were generally unmotivated to be actively involved in national or local politics. This was true in the last years of the nineteenth century as well as in the middle of the twentieth century.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>A sociological survey conducted in the late 1940s shows that “much of the Chinese peasantry…remained indifferent to and ignorant of political affairs.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-620" id="calibre_link-664" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup> Even today, a survey by Andrew J. Nathan and Tianjian Shi suggests that the same patterns still persist: the educated elite are more likely to be aware of the influence of government, whereas the rest of the population has a very low level of awareness. In the judgment of the authors, “The contrast between the two patterns suggest that if a political crisis between the regime and the intellectuals occurs again, the majority of the population may once again not offer much backing for the demands for democratic changes.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-621" id="calibre_link-665" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1273" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Why for a whole century has China not made much headway toward democracy? This is an immensely complex question, a truthful answer to which would involve God-knows-how-many historical factors. Here I would venture to suggest that the waning of elite culture in twentieth-century China may have been one of the factors. In hindsight, the New Culture Movement of the May Fourth era proved to be the last efflorescence of Chinese elite culture. It was in this era that both Chinese scholarship and Western studies reached a new height. In the humanities, especially, many great names date from this era. It was indeed a generation of “clusterings of genius,” to borrow A. L. Kroeber’s apt phrase. The idea of democracy is, after all, a Western concept. To translate it into a Chinese reality, in this early phase it needed native defenders as well as opponents. Only through penetrating debates and discussions, not only on the idea itself but also on many other topics directly and indirectly relating to it, could a clearer understanding be reached. Only then could it hope to take root in and grow on China’s soil. A high level of elite culture is therefore an essential precondition. As Rawls says, the search for a generally acceptable conception of political justice must begin in the “background culture” or “public culture” as “the shared fund of implicitly recognized basic ideas and principles.” It is very unlikely that democracy can flourish in a culturally impoverished land. To give a most recent example, the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989 was clearly related to the revival of elite culture in post-Mao China. Michael Walzer is certainly correct in suggesting that student elitism was rooted in “pre-Communist cultural traditions specific to China.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-622" id="calibre_link-666" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Unfortunately, post&ndash;May Fourth China immediately entered into a period of national crisis, revolution, and war. At the same time, as I have pointed out elsewhere, Chinese intellectuals were also undergoing a historical process of social and political marginalization, thanks particularly to revolution.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-623" id="calibre_link-667" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup> As a result, elite culture in the 1940s declined markedly in a war-ridden China. Without a powerful intellectual elite to champion it, the idea of democracy soon began to go through several ideological twists until it was distorted beyond recognition.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In linking the idea of democracy to Chinese elite culture so closely, I am running the risk of being seen as an advocate of elitism. However, I am not really proposing anything new. On the contrary, I am only rethinking the wisdom of Kang Youwei, Sun Yat-sen, and a host of other early Chinese advocates of democracy who insisted that, in the case of China, it is a matter of historical necessity that democratization in its initial state must begin with an elite leadership.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-624" id="calibre_link-668" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup> Subsequent history seems to reveal that by reducing the intellectual elite to a nonentity, on the one hand, and relying on the so-called masses, on the other, democracy in China only degenerated into demagoguery. There indeed exists a tension between democracy and elitism. Nevertheless, since democracy cannot function by itself without some kind of leadership, I am afraid, the tension is going to remain. As Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. forcefully argues:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1025" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Of all the cants canted in this world, the cant about elitism is the most futile. Government throughout human history has always been government by minorities&mdash;this is, by elites. This statement is as true for democratic and communist states today [1986] as it was for medieval monarchies and primitive tribes. Masses of people are structurally incapable of direct self-government. They must delegate their power to agents. Who says organization says oligarchy. Historians hardly needed Pareto, Mosca and Michels to demonstrate this point. The serious question is not the existence of the ruling elites but their character.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-625" id="calibre_link-669" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">43</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Few today have Schlesinger’s courage to tell this simple historical truth. He is also correct to say that it is the character of the elites that is really at issue. This emphasis on character leads me directly to Irving Babbitt, a great American humanist and admirer of Confucius. In his <i class="calibre9">Democracy and Leadership</i>, first published in 1924, he made quite a point about the great value of Confucian ethics in the molding of the character of a democratic leader. His view has been well summarized by Thomas R. Nevin as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In Babbitt’s conception, Confucian ethics were the oriented complement of the Aristotelian, but with the critical difference that in the former there was a stress upon humility as a check upon self-reliance and, in the aggregate, upon popular will. Like Aristotle, Confucius placed mediatory virtues in a social setting; his teaching concerned not merely the individual of breeding but such a person’s power to influence and regulate the masses. Babbitt’s claim that “not justice in the abstract but the just man” or “man of character” was the only security for society was inspired by the Confucian keynote of exemplification. As a check upon the democrat’s belief in the divinity of numbers, Babbitt posed a basically Confucian model in finding “here and there a person who is worthy of respect and occasionally one who is worthy of reverence.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-626" id="calibre_link-670" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">44</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>So, after all, there is also the possibility that Confucianism may offer something to democracy in return. Let my essay rest on this Confucian note.</span></div>

I must make myself clear that here I am only borrowing Rawls’s idea of “comprehensive doctrine” as “background culture” to illustrate my own point about the Chinese case.

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1133" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>During the 1970s and 1980s over thirty countries shifted from authoritarian to democratic political systems…. Democratization was most successful in countries where Christian and Western influences were strong. New democratic regimes appeared most likely to stabilize in the Southern and Central European countries that were predominantly Catholic or Protestant and, less certainly, in Latin American countries. In East Asia, the Catholic and heavily American influenced Philippines returned to democracy in the 1980s, while Christian leaders promoted movement toward democracy in South Korea and Taiwan…. In the former Soviet Union, the Baltic republics appear to be successfully stabilizing democracy; the degree and stability of democracy prospects in the Muslim republics are bleak. By the 1990s, except for Cuba, democratic transitions had occurred in most of the countries, outside Africa, whose peoples espoused Western Christianity or where major Christian influences existed.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2104" id="calibre_link-2123" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Clearly, in Huntington’s view, the third wave of democratization was largely a Christian phenomenon. This helps explain why he attributes democracy movements in South Korea and Taiwan in the 1980s to the promotion of “Christian leaders.” As far as Taiwan is concerned, his statement is extremely misleading. Taiwan’s successful political transformation has many causes, but Christianity has not yet proved to be one of them.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Huntington’s emphasis on Christianity in the third wave is quite natural given his Western point of view, and as a historical explanation, it is well grounded. However, it is also closely related to his negative view of Confucianism and Islam with respect to democratic development. Huntington consistently maintains that both Islamic and Confucian cultures are inhospitable to democracy. If so, then the third wave is practically over. Moreover, since Huntington identifies Chinese Communists as “Confucians” (as evident from his talk of a “Confucian-Islamic connection”), from his point of view, the prospect of democracy in mainland China must be as bleak as it is in the Muslim republics of the former Soviet Union. This point has some bearing on Pei Minxin’s arguments in “ ‘Creeping Democratization’ in China,” as well as those of Andrew Nathan in “China’s Constitutionalist Option.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2105" id="calibre_link-2124" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Neither Nathan nor Pei takes very seriously Huntington’s notion that “Confucian culture” is an obstacle to democracy; both seem to assume that the third wave will eventually sweep through China. Both essays may be read as variations on a theme: China’s peaceful transition to democracy under the Communist regime. While Nathan explores the possibility of a constitutional option through empowerment of the National People’s Congress (NPC), Pei suggests “creeping democratization” through “endogenous institutional changes” in the following three areas: (1) the rule of law, (2) the NPC, and (3) experimental grassroots self-government in the countryside. In Chinese cosmological terms, Nathan’s point of view embodies the <i class="calibre9">yang</i> <span>陽</span> principle and Pei’s the <i class="calibre9">yin</i> <span>陰</span>, principle. Constitutionalism initiated by the NPC can only be promoted openly and formally; it must of necessity take the form of some political movement with the approval of the party leadership in power. In contrast, Pei’s “creeping democratization” refers to a process of change that takes place under the very noses of the totalitarian rulers without attracting notice. By the time the leaders realize what is happening, the process of democratization will have already advanced to such a stage that it is irreversible. In other words, for Nathan, democracy will come to mainland China through the front door, whereas for Pei it will creep through the back door and windows.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1121" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>From a historical perspective, Nathan is certainly right when he says that “China’s twentieth-century history is littered with constitutions and attempts to make them work” (229). He lists seven constitutions between 1911 and 1949 and four under the Communist regime. In fact, political reform in modern China began with constitutionalism. The earliest attempt was Kang Youwei’s advocacy of constitutional monarchy in 1898; the first draft constitution, based on the Japanese model, was promulgated by the Qing imperial court in 1908.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">WHY DID CONSTITUTIONALISM FAIL?</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>How are we to understand China’s century-long obsession with constitutionalism as a historical phenomenon? I agree with Arthur Waldron’s observation, as quoted by Nathan, that “the search for a constitutional order to replace the dynasties has been the most important theme in twentieth-century China’s history,” as well as with his prediction that “when Deng dies, the search for constitutional order is certain to resume” (228). This is only one side of the question, however. We must also ask why constitutionalist reform in China failed time and again over an entire century.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2106" id="calibre_link-2125" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>First, from the 1890s to the 1990s, enthusiastic advocates of constitutionalism in China consisted mainly of intellectuals and reform-minded bureaucrats who were, as a rule, not at the center of power.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Second, those who held despotic or dictatorial power invariably disregarded the constitution. Authoritarian rulers appealed to the constitution only when they perceived their absolute power or the legitimacy of their regime to be threatened. This was true for Empress Dowager Cixi, Yuan Shikai, Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi), and Mao Zedong. For example, Chiang Kai-shek allowed the constitution of 1947 to be adopted only because his regime desperately needed a coating of legitimacy in postwar China. When he was driven to Taiwan in the early 1950s, Chiang seriously explored dismantling the constitutional apparatus altogether.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2107" id="calibre_link-2126" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup> Mao never respected the constitution, not even when Zhou Enlai was negotiating a draft constitution with the Nationalist Party in Chongqing in early 1946.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2108" id="calibre_link-2127" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> The only time Mao showed any interest in it was in January 1965, when, having been interrupted by Liu Shaoqi on a previous occasion, Mao brought a copy of the constitution to a meeting saying that as a citizen, he had the constitutional right to speak his mind.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2109" id="calibre_link-2128" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Third, since 1911, power struggles between political parties or factions of the ruling party were often engaged in the name of the constitution. Once the struggle was over, however, the winner would immediately shelve the constitution as if it never existed. This happened not only between Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Hanmin in early 1930 (nominally over the controversy of a “provisional constitution”) but also between the Nationalists and the Communists in 1946 and 1947. In 1980, when Deng Xiaoping talked of making the “constitution more perfect,”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2110" id="calibre_link-2129" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> he was engaged in a power struggle with the ultraleftist faction of the party with Hua Guofeng as a rallying force.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2111" id="calibre_link-2130" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1134" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In light of this history, I am skeptical that China is experiencing a “new constitutionalist movement” simply because discussions of constitutionalism have bloomed in recent years. Other than the air in the conference room and the printing machine, little has really moved. Over the past two or three years, I have met a number of visiting intellectuals from mainland China who pin their hopes on the NPC as an engine capable of generating new political reforms and on Qiao Shi as a leader likely to be converted to constitutionalism. If history is any guide, however, the recent revival of constitutionalist discourse most likely signifies the current power struggle within the party. After all, Qiao Shi is one of the few qualified contenders for top leadership in the post-Deng era.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Two of Nathan’s arguments in “China’s Constitutionalist Option” are particularly noteworthy. On the negative side, constitutionalism “may be less probable than anything but the alternatives” (229). On the positive side, constitutionalism “would serve the [Chinese Communist Party’s] interests in legitimation and stability.” Both arguments are reasonable and powerful; I would be the last person on earth to delight in seeing them refuted by history. The trouble with history, however, is that it often plays tricks on us. It not only reveals its reasons after the fact, but also offers more alternatives than the human mind can possibly calculate beforehand.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to Pei’s “creeping democratization,” although more should be said about his “rule of law” and “grassroots self-government.” First, it seems more appropriate to speak of “rule by law” than “rule of law.” Second, by Pei’s own admission, China’s enforcement record is still “abysmal” (216) even though more than six hundred laws were passed by the NPC between 1979 and 1992. Third, as a recent legal study shows, Chinese judges generally lack adequate legal training. Until 1994, about half of Chinese judges had failed to reach a college-graduate level of legal education. Moreover, the judicial system as a whole is no more than a tool for the implementation of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule. It is neither an end in itself nor a servant of justice.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2112" id="calibre_link-2131" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> It is difficult to imagine how the present legal system can help China’s democratization, especially democratization of a “creeping” variety.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>“Grassroots self-government” does not fare any better. Here I need only quote Pei himself: “Still, the gains in grassroots democratization in Chinese villages have been meager. Genuinely free elections have been held in only a tiny fraction of them. Even in the small number of villages where such elections were held, the results have been mixed” (224). The proof of the pudding is, after all, in the eating. “Creeping democratization” as yet lacks proof.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1093" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As a reader, I would like to see the term “creeping” further clarified. Can democracy “creep” all the way to consolidation without discovery? What will happen when “creeping” democratization inevitably confronts head on the “four insistences in the constitution”?<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2113" id="calibre_link-2132" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> To put it in Marxist terms, will this “creeping” always remain a “quantitative change,” or will it reach the point where a “qualitative jump” is required? In a theoretical construction, questions of this kind must be faced squarely.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">CONFUCIANISM AND DEMOCRACY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>I conclude by returning to Huntington’s thesis about the third wave and the clash of civilizations. By linking democracy specifically to Christianity, Huntington implies that the difficulties of China’s democratization lie deep in its Confucian background. Both Nathan and Pei leave this cultural aspect virtually untouched. They seem to assume that the third wave is universal and thereby cuts across cultural boundaries. Is there then a conflict of assumptions between Huntington on the one hand and Nathan and Pei on the other? The answer must be no. In all fairness, Huntington does not believe that Confucian culture is a permanent barrier to democratization. On the contrary, he says the following about cultural traditions and democracy in the non-Christian world:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Great historic cultural traditions, such as Islam and Confucianism, are highly complex bodies of ideas, beliefs, doctrines, assumptions, writings, and behavior patterns. Any major culture, including even Confucianism, has some elements that are compatible with democracy, just as both Protestantism and Catholicism have elements that are clearly undemocratic. Confucian democracy may be a contradiction in terms, but democracy in a Confucian society need not be.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2114" id="calibre_link-2133" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Yet I find Huntington’s discussion of Confucian societies being “inhospitable to democracy” rather oversimplified, both theoretically and historically.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2115" id="calibre_link-2134" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> The problem of identifying the source of this “inhospitableness” is far more complicated than he has indicated. As I have pointed out elsewhere, the earliest Chinese discoverers of the Western idea of democracy in the late nineteenth century were none other than the reform-minded Confucians.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2116" id="calibre_link-2135" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> From the end of the Qing dynasty to the May Fourth Movement of 1919, leading advocates of democracy&mdash;including reformists, revolutionaries, and antitraditionalists&mdash;came almost exclusively from the intellectual elite, which had a strong background in Confucian culture. Many were also leading interpreters of Confucianism of their own day: Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, Zhang Binglin, and Liu Shipei. In later years, even Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi, who were largely responsible for the rise of anti-Confucianism in the May Fourth era, modified their views.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1141" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>These thinkers have helped us understand elements in Confucianism that are compatible with democracy. Hu Shi in particular took great pains to explain to U.S. audiences of his lectures and writings in the 1940s and 1950s how some Confucian ideas and institutions may prove capable of furnishing China with a solid foundation on which to establish constitutional democracy. Confucianism had formed a central part of what John Rawls calls the “background cultures” of traditional Chinese society; with readjustment, it could become a “reasonable comprehensive doctrine” in the formation of a modern concept of political justice.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2117" id="calibre_link-2136" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Confucian education often inculcated in the minds of the young a sense of justice, social responsibility, human equality, and the well-being of people, which are some of the closest Confucian equivalents to Western civic virtues. It was this Confucian public spiritedness that disposed many Chinese intellectuals to Western democratic ideas at the turn of the century. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic of China, is famous for his espousal of Confucian values on the one hand and advocacy of democracy on the other. He showed no sign of psychological tension resulting from his embrace of both cultures.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2118" id="calibre_link-2137" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Much as I sympathize with Huntington’s thesis, I cannot follow him so far as to see the conflict between the West and mainland China as the clash between Western and Confucian civilizations. Given Confucianism’s early reception of the idea of constitutional democracy, one cannot help but wonder if the notion of a “clash of civilizations” applies to China at all. Moreover, for decades, the Communist regime has denounced Confucianism as the “poisonous remains of Chinese feudalism”; Confucian values in both elite and popular cultures are ruined or distorted beyond recognition.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2119" id="calibre_link-2138" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> As far as the CCP is concerned, a return to Confucianism may prove to be more difficult than a transition to constitutional democracy.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">NATIONALISM, NOT DEMOCRACY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>What is really happening in China today is not a revival of Confucian culture but a new wave of nationalism, which seems to be a universal phenomenon in postcommunist countries. In a recent report from Belgrade, we read that students, professors, and many Serbs have shifted from a Marxist paradigm to a fierce form of Serbian nationalism. Chris Hedges of the <i class="calibre9">New York Times</i> tells us, “For two or three years following Tito’s death in 1980, academics, freed from party dogma, reached out to Western intellectual traditions. But this was swiftly terminated with the rise of Serbian nationalism.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2120" id="calibre_link-2139" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> This is revealing, for Chinese intellectuals, especially the younger generation, have traveled the same spiritual road in the short span of a decade. They began with a “culture fever,” showing an unbounded admiration for the West in the mid-1980s that ended tragically in Tiananmen in 1989. In the early 1990s, nationalistic sentiments suddenly resurged. Today, Chinese nationalism has attained monstrous proportions, as evidenced in such virulent xenophobic tracts as <i class="calibre9">China Can Say No</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2121" id="calibre_link-2140" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> The wave of democracy has given way to a wave of nationalism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1164" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>There are signs that the CCP is trying to manipulate this new wave of nationalism to its own advantage. With the bankruptcy of Marxist ideology, the CCP faces its most serious legitimacy crisis ever. Theoretically, the CCP’s interests in legitimation and stability are better served by nationalism than constitutionalization, which carries the inevitable risk of being voted out of power someday. By contrast, it is only a small step from socialism to national socialism, which is practically synonymous with “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” It is unclear how far the CCP can manipulate the rising Chinese nationalism; the more dangerous impulses of nationalism can easily spiral out of control.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>These are not predictions but observations. What will eventually become of nationalism in China is anybody’s guess. The evidence seems clear, however, that the CCP is moving toward nationalism, not constitutionalism or democracy. Should the third wave continue to find mainland China impenetrable in the years to come, it may be advisable to focus our analytical attention on the combined forces of a totalitarian system of Western origin with a new wave of nationalism, which seems to be the order of the day in the non-Western world. In any case, it is high time that Confucian culture be absolved of all blame.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1188" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">A</span>s concepts, both “democracy” and “human rights” are of distinctly Western origins, the former being traceable to ancient Greece and the latter to theories of “Natural Law” and “Natural Rights” developed between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-348" id="calibre_link-380" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> Since the end of the nineteenth century, however, Chinese intellectuals have become so fascinated with them, together with a host of other related Western concepts or values such as liberty, equality, social contract, etc., that they have made every effort to transplant them to China. It is true that during the entire Mao Zedong era (1949&ndash;1976), Chinese intellectuals under the Communist regime were completely silenced, and as a result, talk of democracy or human rights with any degree of seriousness was out of the question. During the very same period, however, Chinese liberal thought advanced by leaps and bounds in Taiwan and Hong Kong, in which “democracy,” “liberty,” “equality,” and “human rights” figured prominently. Two schools of thought may be distinguished in this new intellectual development outside mainland China.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1210" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>On the one hand, the mainstream Chinese liberal tradition, with its anti-Confucianist stance, was carried on and furthered by the May Fourth and post&ndash;May Fourth intellectuals rallying around the Taiwan-based popular journal <i class="calibre9">Ziyou Zhongguo</i> <span>自</span><span>由</span><span>中</span><span>國</span> (Free China) with none other than Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962) as its “publisher.” On the other hand, cultural conservatives of a new Confucian persuasion also began to take “democracy” and “human rights” seriously. In the face of the unprecedented large-scale persecutions then going on wave after wave in mainland China, they came to the realization that the Confucian values they cherished so much would have no chance of being saved if they were deprived of the very right to hold them. They nevertheless insisted that unless and until a way of articulation were found to fit ideas and values of Western origin into the frame of Confucian culture, these imported ideas and values as such could never take root in and grow on Chinese soil, “democracy” and “human rights” being among them. Now allow me to turn to the revival of democracy and human rights discourse in mainland China from the 1980s into the present century.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As is generally known, an immediate result in the realm of thought following the policies of “reform” and “opening up” in the early 1980s was that a generation of Chinese intellectuals looked to Western culture for spiritual guidance. During this era of “culture fever,” as it was then called, ideas current in the West ranging from the New Left, Critical Theory, Modernization Theory, to Neoliberalism, to mention only a few examples, all found a sympathetic ear among young Chinese intellectuals. This sudden inundation of Western ideas alarmed the hard-liners within the Communist Party, on whose insistence a campaign against the so-called Western spiritual pollution was launched as early as 1983. Throughout the decade of the 1980s, however, the most inspiring and powerful idea reintroduced from the West proved to be that of democracy. With it also came a number of closely related values such as freedom and rights, which Chinese intellectuals took to be among the defining features of a democratic society. During those optimistic years, Chinese intellectuals, especially young students, exhibited a passionate and unbounded faith in democracy as a panacea for all of China’s troubles. It was this faith that gave rise to the democracy movement, which ended tragically in Tiananmen on June 4, 1989.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Another central theme widely discussed as well as hotly debated during the “culture fever” period was the relationship of the Chinese (Confucian) tradition to China’s democratization. Needless to say, there was a wide spectrum of views on this question of vital importance. However, as intellectual heirs to the May Fourth antitraditionalists, the majority of Chinese advocates of democracy in the 1980s took a very negative view of Confucianism. In their eyes, Confucianism had all along functioned as a stumbling block to China’s transition to liberal democracy. On the other hand, I must hasten to add, it was also during the very same period that a number of scholars and intellectuals began to rediscover and reevaluate the Confucian humanist tradition, partly as a revolt against party ideology but partly also as a positive response to the Confucian studies outside the Chinese mainland since 1949. These two discourses, one on democracy and the other on Confucianism, were parallel developments in the late 1980s, but began to intersect at various points in the 1990s.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1183" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The above historical overview is intended as an introduction to what I am going to say about “democracy” and “human rights” in relation to Confucian culture. A great deal has already been written on this immensely complex subject. With regard to how the relationship ought to be viewed, practically all the possibilities, from the extremely positive to the extremely negative, have been exhausted. What I propose to do here, therefore, is not to make this long-standing controversy more entangled by offering yet another view of my own. Instead, in what follows I shall suggest a historical perspective in light of which the very nature of the whole controversy may be better understood.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To begin with, allow me to draw a distinction between the concepts of “democracy” and “human rights” as culturally and linguistically specific to the West and the general notions or ideas of democracy and human rights as values common to many, if not all, civilizations. By democracy and human rights in the latter category, I refer, respectively, to the idea of the common people as the source of political authority and the idea that human beings must be treated in ways worthy of their dignity as such, with the implication that they are entitled to certain goods basic to a decent human life. The absence of some specifically Western concepts or terms in a non-Western civilization such as China is no proof of the nonexistence of the general ideas or notions expressed by those concepts or terms. A clear case in point is the Western concept of “science.” The concept itself cannot be found in traditional Chinese categories of learning, but no one today would think of making the suggestion that Joseph Needham’s multivolume <i class="calibre9">Science and Civilization in China</i> (1954&ndash;2008) is a misnomer. I cannot go into details about this distinction with respect to democracy and human rights at this point. However, I shall try to substantiate my argument as my discussions proceed.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In actual practice today, democracy and human rights are inseparable and imply each other. For the purpose of analysis, however, it seems advisable to discuss them separately so that we may develop a clearer sense as to how they stand in relation to Confucian culture.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1352" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The Chinese term for “democracy” (<i class="calibre9">minzhu</i> <span>民</span><span>主</span>) was probably first used by Wang Tao <span>王</span><span>韜</span> (1828&ndash;1897), the famous Chinese assistant to James Legge in the English translation of the Confucian classics. From his travels in England and Europe with Legge, 1867&ndash;1870, he gained firsthand knowledge about Western political systems. He identified altogether three types of state in Europe, which he named, respectively, <i class="calibre9">minzhu</i>, or democracy; <i class="calibre9">junzhu</i> <span>君</span><span>主</span>, or monarchy; and <i class="calibre9">junmin gongzhu</i> <span>君</span><span>民</span><span>共</span><span>主</span>, or constitutional monarchy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-349" id="calibre_link-381" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> Inspired by Wang’s observations, the Confucian philosopher Kang Youwei <span>康</span><span>有</span><span>為</span> (1858&ndash;1927) proposed a scheme of periodization for Chinese political history according to this typological classification. In his influential <i class="calibre9">Kongzi gaizhi kao</i> <span>孔</span><span>子</span><span>改</span><span>制</span><span>考</span> (A Study of Confucius as a Reformer; 1896), Kang divided Chinese history into three periods: “democracy,” the most perfect form of government, was first actualized in the Golden Age of China under the reigns of the legendary sage-emperors Yao and Shun; “constitutional monarchy,” the second best form of government was established in the early Zhou; finally, monarchy (or autocracy), the worst form of government, emerged in China since the Qin unification in 221 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> and lasted to his own day. It was the central thesis of this book that Confucius as a “reformer” was the first Chinese philosophical advocate of democracy showing posterity how to create a second Golden Age through a complex process of institutional changes.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-350" id="calibre_link-382" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> We could easily dismiss the whole exercise as sheer nonsense in terms of historical scholarship, but that would be rather beside the point. Since we are primarily concerned with the Confucian response to the Western concept of democracy, the evidential value of this strategic move on the part of Kang Youwei can hardly be exaggerated. In this instance, Kang not only embraced the Western concept without showing the slightest sign of hesitation, but even tried to naturalize it. This immediately raises a serious question about the conventional wisdom concerning the incompatibility between Confucianism and democracy.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>At this juncture, allow me to turn to the prevailing incompatibility thesis, which is clearly formulated by Samuel P. Huntington of Harvard University as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Almost no scholarly disagreement exists on the proposition that traditional Confucianism was either undemocratic or antidemocratic. The only moderating element was the extent to which in the classic Chinese polity the examination system opened careers to the talented without regard to social background. Even [if] this was the case, however, a merit system of promotion does not make a democracy…. Classic Chinese Confucianism and its derivatives in Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, and, in diluted fashion, Japan emphasized the group over the individual, authority over liberty, and responsibilities over rights. Confucian societies lacked a tradition of rights against the state; to the extent that individual rights did exist, they were created by the state. Harmony and cooperation were preferred over disagreement and competition. The maintenance of order and respect for hierarchy were central values. The conflict of ideas, groups, and parities was viewed as dangerous and illegitimate. Most important, Confucianism merged society and the state and provided no legitimacy for autonomous social institutions to balance the state at the national level…. In practice Confucian or Confucian-influenced societies have been inhospitable to democracy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-351" id="calibre_link-383" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1057" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This is too sweeping a generalization to be susceptible to critical analysis. I quote it only because it is, unfortunately, a view likely to be encountered in many popular writings, especially in the West. However, I am tempted to make a few remarks for the purpose of clarification. First, Huntington’s “Confucian” or “Confucianism” seems too broad, almost identical with “Chinese” or “China.” His formulations are more characteristic of imperial China as a whole than Confucianism per se. He ignores not only the critical dimensions of Confucianism but also the positive features of imperial China. Second, the contrast between China and the West is vastly overdrawn. Emphasis on authority, order, hierarchy, and supremacy of the collectivity over the individual was not less true in medieval Europe than in imperial China. It may also be found in some of the Christian countries in modern times.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Last, if we accept Huntington’s thesis about the supposedly inherent hostility of Confucianism to Western values associated with democracy, then how are we going to account for the simple historical fact that it was Confucians such as Wang Tao and Kang Youwei, mentioned above, who were among the earliest Chinese admirers and advocates of the democratic political system in the West? In this connection, it is desirable to see how Wang Tao’s Confucian background led him to appreciate the Western political and legal system in actual practice as he witnessed it in England. In an essay on the British government, he said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The real strength of England, however, lies in the fact that there is a sympathetic understanding between the governing and the governed, a close relationship between the ruler and the people…. My observation is that the daily domestic political life of England actually embodies the traditional ideals of our ancient Golden Age.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In official appointments the method of recommendation and election is practical, but the candidates must be well known, of good character and achievements before they can be promoted to a position over the people…. And moreover the principle of majority rule is adhered to in order to show impartiality…. He who violates the law goes to the court only to have his confession taken; when the real truth has been obtained, then a verdict made, and he is imprisoned. There has never been such cruelty as torturing and beating him by bamboos and clubs so that his blood and flesh spread all over. In prison the convict is supplied with food and clothing, so that he may not be hungry or cold. He is taught to work and not allowed to become idle. He is never maltreated by those in charge of the prison. The excellence of the prison system is what China has never had since the Golden Age.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-352" id="calibre_link-384" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1268" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Strongly motivated by reformism on the Western model, he undoubtedly idealized the British system. Wholly ignorant of English legal history, he could not have possibly known that not long before, torture had also been used in England as a requirement of “complete proof” in the inquisitorial system, which bore a remarkable resemblance to the system of confession and judicial torture in his own country.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-353" id="calibre_link-385" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> What is particularly remarkable about the above-quoted passage, however, is that Wang Tao’s attention was specifically drawn to two things: first, the idea that a good relationship between the ruler and the people can be best developed only under a democratic system of government; second, the idea that what we would call “human rights” violations, such as confession obtained through torture, can be effectively checked only by a sound judicial system. Nowhere was Wang Tao’s Confucian background more clearly revealed than in his ideals of China’s Golden Age as described in Confucian classics. In his case, the compatibility between Confucianism on the one hand and democracy and human rights on the other was simply taken for granted. Thus, Wang Tao initiated a line of thinking that may be called the indigenous genesis of democratic ideas in Chinese high antiquity independent of the West. This line of thinking and inquiry was extremely influential from the end of the nineteenth century to the early decades of the twentieth. Reformists and revolutionaries alike fell under its spell. It may not be too much of an exaggeration to suggest that without this ideological support from Confucianism, neither the constitutional reform movement of 1898 nor the republican revolution of 1911 could have been set in motion in the first place. We have already seen how the reformist leader Kang Youwei tried to naturalize “democracy.” Now allow me to quote a passage from Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, to make my point. Speaking of the Chinese origin of his “principle of democracy” (<i class="calibre9">minquan zhuyi</i> <span>民</span><span>權</span><span>主</span><span>義</span>), Sun said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In ancient China…there were statements like “Heaven sees with the eyes of its people. Heaven hears with the ears of its people,” “The people are of supreme importance; the sovereign comes last,” “I have indeed heard of the punishment of the outcast Zhou, but have not heard of any regicide,” “the people are of supreme importance; the sovereign comes last.” So we cannot say that democratic ideas have been lacking in China. However, what we have are ideas but not institutions.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-354" id="calibre_link-386" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>It may be pointed out that all three statements are from <i class="calibre9">Mencius</i>. The first one is clearly the Chinese counterpart of vox populi, vox Dei, which is of very early origin and quoted by Mencius. The second one is the Confucian idea of the people’s right to revolution. The latter expresses the notion of the common people as the ultimate source of political authority. Sun, as we all know, was equally familiar with Western political theories and the Confucian heritage, but he honestly believed that his democratic revolution was as much inspired by the French and American revolutions as by Confucian “democratic ideas.” This contrasts interestingly with Huntington’s judgment that “China’s Confucian heritage…creates obstacles to democratization.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-355" id="calibre_link-387" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-994" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>No meaningful discussion of Confucianism with respect to the Western concept of democracy is possible without some clarification of its political principles. Specifically, it is important to determine those Confucian political ideas that happened to circulate widely at the end of the nineteenth century that predisposed Chinese intellectuals so favorably to the idea of democracy. In this regard, I consider it most pertinent to make a brief mention of Huang Zongxi’s <span>黃</span><span>宗</span><span>羲</span> (1610&ndash;1695) <i class="calibre9">Mingyi daifang lu</i> <span>明</span><span>夷</span><span>待</span><span>訪</span><span>録</span> (Waiting for the Dawn: A Plan for the Prince), which has become a classic in the history of Chinese political thought.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-356" id="calibre_link-388" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> Though written in the mid-seventeenth century, this treatise remained obscure until it was rediscovered by reform- or revolution-oriented intellectuals at the end of the nineteenth century. Since then, its influence on a whole generation of scholars and thinkers in China and Japan is too well known to require elaboration here. It is therefore quite safe to take <i class="calibre9">Waiting for the Dawn</i> as the end product of a long tradition of Confucian political thinking.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Limited by time, I can only mention three points. First, following the Mencian tradition, Huang developed the notion of the people as the ultimate source of political authority. To use his language, in China’s Golden Age, the people were the “master” while the supreme ruler (<i class="calibre9">jun</i> <span>君</span>, meaning “prince,” “king,” or “emperor”) was only a “tenant.” In other words, the ruler was no more than a servant chosen by the people to manage their affairs in the public world. Since, however, the world is too big for one man to govern, governance must be shared with colleagues who have been known in later history as “ministers” (<i class="calibre9">chen</i> <span>臣</span>). It should then be clear that the “minister” must also be responsible to the people, not the “prince.” But Huang deplored the fact that all these basic principles were reversed since the emergence of the unified empire in 221 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> From that time on, the emperor has assumed the place of “master,” taking the whole empire to be his private estate. As a result, the people have become “tenants” subject to the emperor’s capricious exploitation and oppression, and the “ministers” are likewise treated as if they were his personal servants. In short, the Chinese political world had long been turned upside down and Huang wrote his treatise with a clear intention to set it in the right order.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1261" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Second, Huang also developed the Confucian tradition of political criticism to a new height. In the chapter “Schools” (Xuexiao), he emphasized that the Confucian school must perform both an educational function and a political function. In addition to the training of scholar-officials, the school ought also to be a place where political criticisms are openly expressed; the emperor and his ministers have the duty to sit periodically as students in the Imperial College and listen while critical discussions of current issues are conducted among the scholars in attendance. This is necessary because, he reasoned, what the emperor thinks is right might not be necessarily right; what he thinks is wrong might not be necessarily wrong. The emperor must not decide right and wrong by himself, but share with the schools the determination of right and wrong. Of course, this idea did not originate with Huang. Confucius had already said, “When the Way prevails in the Empire, the commoners do not express critical views” (<i class="calibre9">Lunyu</i> [Analects], 15.1.2). The implication is clear enough: when the empire is misgoverned, even a commoner has the right to criticism. Moreover, according to the <i class="calibre9">Zuozhuan</i> <span>左</span><span>傳</span> (Zuo Commentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals), Duke Xiang, year 31, the Prime Minister Zichan of Zheng refused to take any action against village schools where his policies were harshly criticized. When Confucius learned about this, he praised the prime minister highly.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-357" id="calibre_link-389" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> This tradition is not only very old but also continues, as shown in the student movements in Han, Song, and Huang’s own times. However, Huang was the first Confucian scholar who proposed to accord political criticism in schools a legal status and an institutional form.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Last, Huang’s emphasis on the “rule of law” as opposed to the “rule by men” must be recognized as a significant new development in Confucian political thought. It was his firm belief that “only if there is governance by law can there be governance by men,” a view almost opposite to the Confucian tradition. However, his “law” must not be mistaken as a simple and direct borrowing from the Legalist school. The Legalist law as embodied in the legal codes since the Qin dynasty was, in his eyes, only to serve the interests of the emperor, which he called “un-Lawful laws.” The “Law” he proposed to establish, on the contrary, was to safeguard the world for the people. As de Bary rightly points out, Huang was primarily concerned with the establishment of a few “basic laws” conceived “as more in the nature of a constitution or system of government than a legal code; they should be laws serving the interests of the people and conforming to moral principles.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-358" id="calibre_link-390" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>On the basis of these ideas and others in <i class="calibre9">Waiting for the Dawn</i>, Chinese intellectuals in the late Qing, from both the reformist and revolutionist camps, came to take great pride in claiming Huang as one of China’s foremost democratic thinkers. Writing in 1923, Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929), who acknowledged the shaping influence of this book on his early political life and thought, still considered it marvelous that Huang’s treatise could have antedated Rousseau’s <i class="calibre9">Social Contract</i> (1762) by “several decades” (actually, to be exact, a whole century).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-359" id="calibre_link-391" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> In 1895, Sun Yat-sen also presented a newly printed copy of the first two essays of the treatise to his Japanese friend, which saw the light of day only in the early 1990s. It has been taken by scholars as evidence of a Chinese ideological origin in Sun’s revolutionary republicanism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-360" id="calibre_link-392" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> Thus, Huang’s <i class="calibre9">Waiting for the Dawn</i> provides us with a vivid illustrative example showing how the seventeenth-century version of Confucian political thought prepared the Chinese intellectual elite to appreciate and accept Western democratic ideas and values. I must make myself clear; here I am not saying that Huang is comparable to J. J. Rousseau, John Locke, or J. S. Mill, as some earlier scholars suggested. All I am saying is that Huang did develop certain new interesting ideas that can best be explained to the Western audience in terms of democracy. If my earlier distinction between “linguistically specific concepts” and “general ideas” contains a grain of truth, then I may say that Huang developed a general Confucian notion of the people as the source of political authority to its limit, which is at the same time similar and dissimilar to the Western conception of democracy in important ways.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1186" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Now, let me turn to the question of human rights and its historical relevance to Confucian culture. Like “democracy,” “human rights” as a concept is nonexistent in Confucian discourse in traditional China. However, if we agree that the concept of “human rights” as defined in the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) is predicated on the double recognition of a common humanity and human dignity, then we are justified, as in the case of democracy, to speak of a Confucian idea of “human rights” without the Western term. Moreover, it is interesting to note that in the Western history of rights theories, there is this famous argument:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The language of rights is difficult to use straightforwardly: it is the famous argument…to have a right is merely to be the beneficiary of someone else’s duty, and that all propositions involving rights are straightforwardly translatable into propositions solely involving duties. If this is true, then the language of rights is irrelevant, and to talk of “human rights” is simply to raise the question of what kinds of duty we are under to other human beings, rather than to provide us with any independent moral insights.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-361" id="calibre_link-393" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Needless to say, I am not qualified to make any judgment on the validity or invalidity of this argument. I introduce it here only because it strikes me as surprisingly relevant to my discussion of the question of “human rights” in Confucian culture, especially when this argument is further clarified as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>If any right can be completely expressed as a more or less complex set of duties on other people towards the processor of the right, and those duties can in turn be explained in terms of some higher-order moral principle, then the point of a separate language of rights seems to have been lost, and with it the explanatory and justificatory force possessed by references to rights.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-362" id="calibre_link-394" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Taking it out of its original Benthamite context with a twist, I consider this argument admirably satisfactory as a historical explanation of the total absence of the concept of “human rights” in the Confucian tradition. Throughout Chinese history, Confucians used the language of duties instead of that of rights. Take as example the following advice that Mencius gave to King Hui of Liang:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-995" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>When determining what means of support the people should have, a clear-sighted ruler ensures that these are sufficient, on the one hand, for the care of parents, and, on the other, for the support of wife and children, so that people always have sufficient food in good years and escape starvation in bad; only then does he drive them towards goodness; in this way people find it easy to follow him…. If you wish to put this into practice, why not go back to fundamentals? If mulberry is planted in every homestead of five <i class="calibre9">mu</i> <span>畝</span> of land, then those who are fifty can wear silk; if chickens, pigs and dogs do not miss their breeding season, then those who are seventy can eat meat; if each lot of a hundred <i class="calibre9">mu</i> is not deprived of labour during the busy seasons, then families with several mouths to feed will not go hungry. Exercise due care over the education provided by village schools, and discipline the people by teaching them duties proper to sons and younger brothers, and those whose heads have turned grey will not be carrying loads on the road. When the aged wear silk and eat meat and the masses are neither cold nor hungry, it is impossible for their prince not to be a true King.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-363" id="calibre_link-395" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Here Mencius is giving a detailed description of what kinds of duty a true king is under to his people. However, if we translate his language of duties into the language of rights, it would then become immediately clear that people not only have the right to the use of land and the right to be left alone during agricultural seasons but also the right to education. Confucian texts as well as historical records are full of discussions of duties or responsibilities expected of individuals in all kinds of political and social roles. Many of them, I believe, can be transposed to read as rights of their beneficiaries. Rights and duties entail each other; they are two sides of the same coin. Here lies a peculiarity of the Confucian idea of human rights. Its meaning can be better grasped by a close examination of the other side of the coin.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Recognition of a common humanity and respect for human dignity are both clearly articulated in the <i class="calibre9">Analects</i>, <i class="calibre9">Mencius</i>, and other early Confucian texts.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-364" id="calibre_link-396" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> It is remarkable that by the first century <small class="calibre7">C.E.</small> at the latest, the Confucian notion of human dignity was openly referred to in imperial decrees as sufficient grounds for the prohibition of sale or killing of slaves. In 9 <small class="calibre7">C.E.,</small> Wang Mang, the emperor of the Xin dynasty, condemned the previous Qin dynasty for the practice of selling slaves in the marketplace with the following words:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>[The Qin state] also established market-places for male and female slaves, putting [human beings] in like enclosures with those for cattle and horses. In their rule over their common people and subjects, [the Qin rulers] made arbitrary decisions about their lives. [As a result] villainous and oppressive persons took advantage of the opportunity to make profit, even kidnapping and selling other people’s wives and children, going contrary to the will of Heaven and disordering human relationships. This is contradictory to the principle that “of all living things [i.e., animals and plants, produced by] Heaven and Earth, the human person is the noblest.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-365" id="calibre_link-397" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1187" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In 35 <small class="calibre7">C.E.</small>, Emperor Guangwu of the Later Han also promulgated the following brief edict saying: “Of all living things produced by Heaven and Earth the human person is the noblest. [From now on,] anyone who commits the crime of killing male or female slaves will not receive reduced punishment.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-366" id="calibre_link-398" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> These two examples suffice to show how the Confucian idea of human dignity was translated into legal action. Slavery as an institution was never accepted as legitimate by Confucianism. Hu Shi once told a story about the famous poet Tao Qian <span>陶</span><span>潛</span> (365&ndash;427) who sent a young servant to his son. In the letter to his son, the poet wrote: “Do treat this boy with kindness. For he is also the son of another father just like me.” Hu Shi was still a teenager when he read about this touching anecdote, but he admitted that it produced an enduring effect on his relationship with whoever happened to work for him later in his life.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-367" id="calibre_link-399" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> This story reminds us of the point made emphatically by Mencius that even a “beggar” must be dealt with in a way fully worthy of his human dignity.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-368" id="calibre_link-400" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Finally, I wish to say a word about the Confucian view of the individual self. Nowadays, it has been generally held, especially in the West, that “human rights” in China, if they can be developed at all on the Confucian foundation, are mostly likely to be of the communal variety. The Western kind of individual rights runs counter not only to Confucianism but to Chinese culture as a whole. As far as I can see, the view seems to have been an offshoot of the still ongoing debate between communitarianism and individualism in the West.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-369" id="calibre_link-401" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> I cannot possibly discuss this question here. All I wish to say is that the contrast between Chinese communitarianism and Western individualism has been vastly overdrawn. Many Western writers, it seems to me, have read too much twentieth-century Chinese totalitarianism back into the Confucian tradition. If we turn our eyes from academia to realities, the West is not so individualistic and China is not so communitarian. As a matter of fact, the Chinese may be much more individualistic than most scholars have imagined. Otherwise, Dr. Sun Yat-sen would have to register the famous complaint that “China is like a tray of sand,” by which he probably meant that each grain represents a single Chinese family.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Allow me to make one more historical observation to conclude my discussion. From the sixteenth century onward, Confucianism was moving slowly but unmistakably from communitarianism to individualism. In philosophy, this shift can be most clearly discerned in Wang Yangming’s theory of <i class="calibre9">liangzhi</i> <span>良</span><span>知</span> (innate knowledge). Originally, Wang identified <i class="calibre9">liangzhi</i> with the Heavenly Principle (<i class="calibre9">Tianli</i> <span>天</span><span>理</span>), which is an all-embracing concept emphasizing “man’s oneness with Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things.” In 1521, however, he reformulated his theory in terms of individuation. When one disciple asked him, “Innate knowledge is one. Why did each sage view principle differently?” Wang offered the following answer: “How could these sages be confined to a rigid pattern? So long as they all sincerely proceeded from innate knowledge, what harm is there in each one’s explaining in his own way?…You people should just go ahead and cultivate innate knowledge. If all have the same innate knowledge, there is no harm in their being different here and there.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-370" id="calibre_link-402" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> Clearly, Wang Yangming’s version of Confucianism was beginning to move away from the traditional emphasis on unity of thought and toward diversity and individuation of views. It was this subtle shift of emphasis that led to the rise of Neo-Confucian individualism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-371" id="calibre_link-403" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1326" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The same individualist turn also occurred in Confucian social thought. Here it suffices to take the polarity of “common good” (<i class="calibre9">gong</i> <span>公</span>) versus “self-interest” (<i class="calibre9">si</i> <span>私</span>) as an illustrative example. In the Confucian tradition up to the sixteenth century, it had been an unquestioned principle that “self-interest” must at all times be subordinate to “common good,” which was predicted on the more fundamental principle of the priority of community to individual. Suddenly, in the middle of the sixteenth century, a scholar-turned-merchant named Yu Xie <span>喻</span><span>燮</span> (1496&ndash;1583) challenged this traditional view thus: “Common good can be established only if self-interest is realized in the first place.” He was followed by a long list of famous names in Ming-Qing intellectual history, including Li Zhi <span>李</span><span>贄</span> (1527&ndash;1602), Huang Zongxi, Gu Yanwu <span>顧</span><span>炎</span><span>武</span> (1613&ndash;1682), and Dai Zhen <span>戴</span><span>震</span> (1724&ndash;1777). This new conception is best expressed by Gu Yanwu, who said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>It is natural and normal for everyone in the world to be concerned about his own family and cherish his own children. The Son of Heaven may care for his subjects, but he cannot possibly do better than they can for themselves. This has been the case even before the Three Dynasties. What the sage does is to transform the self-interest of every individual person into a common good for all with his own person as the key link. In this way, a universal order is established…. Therefore, what is self-interest to every individual person in the world is common good to the Son of Heaven.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-372" id="calibre_link-404" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>What he is really saying in a nutshell is that “self-interest” and “common good” are not opposed to each other and the only function for the government (symbolized by the “Son of Heaven”) to perform in the name of the “common good” is to see to it that the “self-interests” of all the people in the world are to be fulfilled each in his individual way. This point further sharpened when he remarked elsewhere that “with all the self-interests in the world combined, the common good is thus formed.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-373" id="calibre_link-405" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> Clearly, in this new formulation, the common good is conceived as but the sum total of all the individual self-interests and therefore depends entirely on the latter for its very existence. I must also add that in this view, we sense a deep distrust of the imperial state on the part of its author.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-374" id="calibre_link-406" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1392" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This individualistic turn in Confucian political sociopolitical thinking, it may be argued, created a new frame of mind that much facilitated the Chinese reception of Western values and ideas in the last years of the Qing dynasty. Take Liang Qichao’s discussion of “rights” between the individual and the state in 1903 as an example. He said: “The combination of fractions of rights will make up the right of a totality. All the individual senses of right will add up to a collective sense of rights of the whole nation. Thus cultivation of the sense of national right must start with the individual.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-375" id="calibre_link-407" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> We need only substitute “self-interest” and “common good” for “individual rights” and “national right” in the above passage to discover that he is actually making the same point that Gu Yanwu or Yu Xie made long ago: “With all the self-interests in the world combined, the common good is thus formed,” or “common good can be established only if self-interest is realized in the first place.” The structural similarity between these propositions is unmistakable. In his letter to Liang, dated “the fourth month, 1902,” Yan Fu <span>嚴</span><span>復</span> discussed in considerable detail the concept of “rights” (<i class="calibre9">quanli</i> <span>權</span><span>利</span>) and how it ought to be rendered into classical Chinese.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-376" id="calibre_link-408" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup> By this time, it may be further noted, Yan had already completed his translation of Mill’s <i class="calibre9">On Liberty</i>, to be published in 1903 under the title <i class="calibre9">On the Boundaries of the Rights of Society and of the Individual</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-377" id="calibre_link-409" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> We can safely assume that Liang’s two essays on “Rights” and “Liberty” in his justly famous <i class="calibre9">Xinmin shuo</i> (On the New Citizen; 1902&ndash;1906) must have been written under Yan’s influence. There can be no question, therefore, that when Liang wrote the above-quoted passage, he was consciously struggling with the Western concept of “rights.” At the subconscious level, however, his thinking was inevitably conditioned by his familiarity with the new formulation of the polarity between “self-interest” and the “common good” as proposed by earlier Confucians. This interesting case seems to lend special support to my contention that it was precisely Confucianism as background culture that made it possible for the Chinese intellectual elite to be so readily receptive to Western concepts regarding “democracy” and “human rights,” along with a host of others.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-378" id="calibre_link-410" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The trouble with “democracy” and “human rights” in present-day China comes from an entirely different source. Since Confucian values in both elite and popular cultures have been ruined or distorted beyond recognition, particularly between 1949 and 1976,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-379" id="calibre_link-411" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> it is extremely difficult to see precisely in what sense that Confucianism must continue to bear the blame for posing an insurmountable obstacle to China’s democratization. Given its present condition in China, I am also doubtful whether Confucianism alone can offer an alternative system of sociopolitical arrangements in which the language of “democracy” and “human rights” is completely absent. As we have seen, both concepts have been naturalized in China over a full century. It is simply inconceivable that from now on the Chinese intellectual elite can engage in any serious political discussion without the use of terms such as “democracy” and “human rights,” and for that matter, also “freedom” and “individual autonomy.” The real question, it seems to me, is rather how to make Confucian culture continuously relevant in such a discussion.</span></div>

The obstacles posed by Confucian culture do not seem greater than those of other cultures, and when compared to Hinduism or Islam, would appear to be much less significant.” See his “Modernization and the Future of Democracy in Asia,” in <i class="calibre9">The Predicament of Modernization in Asia</i>, ed.

In emphasizing the central importance of the notion of human dignity in Confucianism, I do not mean to insinuate that there are fewer instances of violation of human rights in Chinese history than in other civilizations. Rather, I share de Bary’s view that it is historically unfounded to blame Confucianism for all the sins in the Chinese past. Foot binding is a case in point. As de Bary says, “foot-binding was often cited as a prime symbol of a cramped, cruel, male dominated Confucianism.” However, this particular form of violation of “woman’s rights,” as he shows clearly, had nothing to do either with Confucianism or with Buddhism. See Wm. Theodore de Bary, <i class="calibre9">The Trouble with Confucianism</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991), 104. In this connection, I would like to call attention to an important but long neglected fact that all the descendants of Cheng Yi <span>程</span><span>頤</span> (1033&ndash;1107), a founder of Neo-Confucianism, faithfully followed their ancestral tradition of not practicing foot binding in the families down to the Yuan Period.

<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">1</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1285" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The concept of “national history” in its current Western usage was wholly unfamiliar to Chinese historians before the twentieth century. This was primarily because there was no notion of “nation” in traditional Chinese political parlance. A most revealing illustration may be found in a conversation between a Chinese official and a British trade representative in Canton prior to the outbreak of the Opium War in 1839. The official is reported to have been at a complete loss when the trade representative referred to China as a “nation.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-896" id="calibre_link-939" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> Even after the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, many high-ranking Chinese officials at the Imperial Court still insisted that there could be no more than two or three “nations” in the Western world.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-897" id="calibre_link-940" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> Again, in 1872, James Legge, a great translator of Chinese classics, criticized China’s officials and people for their failure to “realize that China is only one of many independent nations in the world.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-898" id="calibre_link-941" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> It was not until 1864, when W. A. P. Martin completed his Chinese translation of Henry Wheaton’s <i class="calibre9">Elements of International Law</i> (first published in 1836), that the Chinese Foreign Office (Tsungli [Zongli <span>總</span><span>理</span>] Yamen <span>衙</span><span>門</span>) formally acknowledged the fact that “nowadays there are many nations outside China.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-899" id="calibre_link-942" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup> By 1880, however, China had been drawn into the “family of nations,” much to its dismay and certainly not without reluctance.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1366" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Instead of a “nation,” China perceived itself as “All-under-Heaven” (<i class="calibre9">tianxia</i> <span>天</span><span>下</span>), which, as generally agreed among historians of China today, is best interpreted as a Sinocentric world order. In this view of the world, China was supposedly surrounded by countries and peoples who not only were culturally inferior but also actively sought to be “transformed” by Chinese civilization. Needless to say, this self-image was more myth than reality. Nor is it difficult to find contradictory examples in Chinese history, especially between the tenth and thirteenth centuries, when China was forced to accept foreign states as equals.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-900" id="calibre_link-943" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>However, this has little relevance to the Chinese historiographical tradition. In traditional historical writings, official and private alike, China is always treated as <i class="calibre9">tianxia</i>, with attention focused largely on the activities of the Imperial Court, whereas all other known countries are described either as “vassal states” or as countries outside the Sinocentric world order. The relative importance of any country mentioned in these accounts is invariably determined by how close a relation it had with the reigning dynasty in China. It made little difference whether this dynasty was ethnically Chinese or non-Chinese (i.e., Mongolian or Manchu). In Confucian historiography, a non-Chinese dynasty would be regarded as being in possession of the Mandate of Heaven if it successfully ruled a unified China according to the standards of Chinese culture. As Mencius said of Shun the sage-ruler and of King Wen of Zhou, two dynastic founders in ancient China: “Shun was an Eastern Barbarian and King Wen was a Western Barbarian. Yet when they had their way in the central kingdoms [Zhongguo <span>中</span><span>國</span>; Central States, or “China”], their actions matched like the two halves of a tally-stick. The standards of the two sages, one earlier and one later, were identical” (<i class="calibre9">Mencius</i>, 4B.1). Thus, in the final analysis, the idea of <i class="calibre9">tianxia</i> was defined in cultural rather than ethnic terms.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The Chinese perception of a Sinocentric world order exerted an equally formative influence on the Chinese historiographical tradition. As a result, “dynastic history” remained the dominant paradigm in Chinese historiography until the close of the nineteenth century. Then, however, a quiet revolution in historical thought took place&mdash;a revolution that led to the paradigmatic change from “dynastic history” to “national history.”</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">2</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1311" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The idea of “national history” was introduced to Chinese historiography in the early years of the twentieth century. It resulted largely from Chinese historians’ realization that China was no longer “All-under-Heaven” but a member of the “family of nations.” This breakthrough started, however, not in China but in Japan. Around 1900, many leading Chinese historians took refuge in Japan as a result of their involvement in anti-Manchu political activities. Among them were Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929), Zhang Binglin <span>章</span><span>炳</span><span>麟</span> (1869&ndash;1935), and Liu Shipei <span>劉</span><span>師</span><span>培</span> (1884&ndash;1919). While in Japan, they had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with Japanese works on Western history and social sciences, and thereby acquired a comparative perspective hitherto unknown in Chinese historiography. It is interesting that while Liang the reformist and Zhang the revolutionary were politically opposed to each other, they nevertheless joined hands as historians in starting a revolution in historical thinking that led to the rise of “national history” as a new paradigm.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In July 1902, Zhang Binglin returned from his second trip to Japan and planned to write a general history of China. By “general history” (<i class="calibre9">tongshi</i> <span>通</span><span>史</span>), he meant two things. First, it was to be a history from remote antiquity to the recent past, thus cutting across all dynasties; and second, it was to be a comprehensive history focusing especially on institutional, psychological, social, and religious developments. In both themes, Zhang clearly wanted to break away from the “dynastic history” tradition. In a letter to Liang Qichao, he said that his decision to write a general history of China was prompted by reading works by Japanese sociologists. He believed that he could give Chinese history a new meaning as well as a new structure by integrating his extensive knowledge of traditional learning with modern sociological insights. He also wished to achieve two goals: first, to establish valid generalizations to explain the internal political changes in Chinese history, and second, to revitalize the ethos of the people in order to inspire and guide China in its search for a viable future.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-901" id="calibre_link-944" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1388" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Liang Qichao responded to Zhang’s idea with great enthusiasm. In fact, around this time, Liang was also giving as great deal of thought to the very same task and had his own plan for a “general history of China.” His “Zhongguoshi xulun” (Prolegomena to Chinese History),<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-902" id="calibre_link-945" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> written in 1901, marks the beginning of the transition of Chinese historiography from tradition to modernity. In this trailblazing essay, he tried to define Chinese history vis-à-vis world history. China, he freely admitted, was no longer the center of world civilization. In the modern age, it was Western civilization that dominated the world. However, since China had only recently begun to participate in the West-dominated world, Liang expected Chinese civilization to play an important role in the world in the centuries to come. According to his scheme of periodization, Chinese history could be divided into three periods. During the ancient period, from antiquity to the unification of China in 221 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>, China was only “China’s China”; during the middle period, from 221 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> to around 1800, China was “Asia’s China”; and during the modern period, since around 1800, China had become “the World’s China.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-903" id="calibre_link-946" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> Here our historian seems to be at pains to seek a new identity for Chinese history. Since China had ceased to be “All-under-Heaven,” Chinese history could no longer be identified as the history of the Sinocentric world order. Nor could China simply be identified as one of the “nations” in the West-dominated world. Thus, Liang considered Chinese history as something more than “national history” in the ordinary sense of the term. He compared Chinese history not with the history of any other single nation, but with that of the West as a whole. In other words, China was more a “civilization” than a “nation.” Here he anticipated Arnold J. Toynbee by more than three decades. Roughly speaking, his “China’s China” and “Asia’s China” closely parallel Toynbee’s “Sinic Civilization” and “Far Eastern Civilization.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Liang’s interactions with Zhang Binglin in 1902, however, led him to a thoroughly critical reexamination of the Chinese historiographical tradition. His essay “Xin shi xue” (New History, 1902)<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-904" id="calibre_link-947" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> was probably a direct and immediate response to Zhang’s letter mentioned above. At this time, Zhang, with his outstanding accomplishments in classical philology, was generally recognized as a master of traditional Chinese learning, equally at home with Confucian classics, history, philosophy, and literature. The advocacy of a revolution in historical scholarship by such a learned man must have emboldened Liang enormously. As a result, in his “New History,” Liang began to demolish the “dynastic history” model systematically. Of the four fundamental flaws he found in traditional Chinese historiography, the following three are considered to have been specifically rooted in the “dynastic” paradigm:</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>First, “dynastic history” illustrates only the Imperial Court and not China as a “nation.” It would be no exaggeration to say that the twenty-four “dynastic histories” are no more than the genealogies of the ruling houses. The dynastic historian focuses his attention almost exclusively on how an Imperial house conquered, ruled, and finally lost the “All-under-Heaven.” Second, with “basic annals” and “biographies” as main categories, “dynastic histories” record only the activities of certain individuals and say nothing about China as a collective whole. As a result, national or social consciousness has been underdeveloped in China. Third, the history of a dynasty was traditionally compiled or written only after the dynasty in question had become defunct. This practice inevitably gave rise to the “antiquarian fallacy” whereby the traditional Chinese historian was a collector of dead facts, and shunned contemporary developments.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-905" id="calibre_link-948" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Whether or not Liang’s criticism was exactly fair, his essay “New History” certainly did a great deal to discredit the “dynastic” tradition in Chinese historiography. Liang’s characterization of the twenty-four dynastic histories as “genealogies of the ruling houses” has since been quoted so often that it is almost proverbial in China. Even the apt observation by the European sinologist Étienne Balazs that most Chinese histories were “written by the bureaucrats and for the bureaucrats” can be shown to be a distant echo of a remark in Liang’s “New History.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-906" id="calibre_link-949" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1111" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Zhang Binglin’s idea about the importance of history in relation to national consciousness left a particularly deep impression on Liang’s mind. In his 1902 essay, we find Liang deploring the miserable failure of “dynastic” historiography and stressing the point that China’s very survival depends on a deep sense of national solidarity that only a new kind of historical knowledge can inspire and nourish. We thus detect a subtle shift of emphasis between “Prolegomena to Chinese History” of 1901 and “New History” of 1902. In the former essay, Liang was seeking to redefine Chinese history from the perspective of world history, whereas in the latter he was looking for the “spirit” or “ideal” in Chinese history from the national point of view. This change of heart was largely due to Zhang’s influence. Significantly, when Zhang visited Japan in late February 1902, he stayed at first with Liang in Yokohama, where the two spent many days in long and learned discussions. As Zhang’s letter of July to Liang indicates, it was during Zhang’s second trip to Japan, between February and July 1902, that their views on Chinese history gradually converged. Thus, they jointly started the modern transformation of Chinese historiography whereby “national history” has replaced “dynastic history” as the focus of historical research and writing.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">3</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1312" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In early 1905, the Society for the Preservation of National Learning was founded in Shanghai, whose <i class="calibre9">Guocui xuebao</i> <span>國</span><span>粹</span><span>學</span><span>報</span> (National Essence Journal) was the leading influence in the Chinese world of learning until the fall of the Manchu dynasty in 1911. A circle of scholars formed around this society and its journal to start what came to be known as the National Essence Movement. Zhang Binglin was a dominant figure and published regularly in the journal. Another prime mover was the precocious Liu Shipei, who as chief editor was also a major contributor to the journal. Other important members of the circle included Huang Jie <span>黃</span><span>節</span> (1874&ndash;1935), Deng Shi <span>鄧</span><span>實</span> (1877&ndash;1941), Chen Qubing <span>陳</span><span>去</span><span>病</span> (1874&ndash;1933), and Ma Xulun <span>馬</span><span>敘</span><span>倫</span> (1884&ndash;1970). The term “national essence” (<i class="calibre9">guocui</i> in Chinese and <i class="calibre9">kokusui</i> in Japanese) was a neologism borrowed from Japan, where a similar movement arose in the 1880s as a nativist reaction against the wave of Westernization. In the Japanese case, “national essence” seems to imply that each nation has a particular spirit that cannot be copied by another and that the survival of a nation depends on the preservation of this spirit. Japanese thinkers of the “national essence” persuasion were concerned that too much and indiscriminate Westernization would damage the national spirit. With the Chinese National Essence Movement, however, the case was somewhat different. The Chinese group used the idea of “national essence” to serve two purposes: to arouse the ethnic hostility of the Han Chinese against the Manchu dynasty, and to redefine China’s identity in response to the growing impact of the West. It was particularly characteristic of the Chinese movement that the study of Chinese history was accorded a central place in its agenda. Unlike their Japanese predecessors, who found it rather difficult to define Japanese “national essence” in precise terms, the Chinese group identified Chinese history as “national essence” from the outset. Zhang Binglin, Liu Shipei, Deng Shi, and Ma Xulun, for example, all regarded history as the fountainhead of Chinese traditional learning. Following the eighteenth-century philosopher of history, Zhang Xuecheng <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span> (1738&ndash;1801), they sacralized history and repeatedly quoted his famous saying that “all the classics are history.” In the view of these scholars, the national spirit of China is embodied in its history and the spirit survives as long as its history is preserved. Thus, the Chinese National Essence Movement devoted itself largely to the promotion of historical studies and it was here that the <i class="calibre9">National Essence Journal</i> made an important contribution to the intellectual revolution in twentieth-century China.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The National Essence group practiced what Liang Qichao and Zhang Binglin had preached regarding the paradigmatic shift from “dynastic history.” Echoing Liang’s criticism that “dynastic histories” are no more than genealogies of the ruling houses, one author insisted that the periodization of Chinese history must replace the idea of “dynasty” completely. Instead, such periodic concepts as “ancient,” “medieval,” and “modern” would be employed to show the changes of China as a nation. According to Deng Shi, dynastic histories are histories of the emperors and must give way to a “history of the nation or people” (<i class="calibre9">minshi</i> <span>民</span><span>史</span>). As a reaction against dynastic history, which was now seen as political history narrowly defined, Deng’s conception of “the history of the nation” consisted of a wide variety of specialized histories such as “racial history,” “intellectual history,” “history of education,” “history of arts and crafts,” “history of social customs,” “economic history,” “history of diplomacy,” etc.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-907" id="calibre_link-950" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> This conception also agrees with Zhang Binglin’s “general history” and Liang Qichao’s “New History.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1132" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>However, the new conception of national history as enthusiastically espoused by the new generation of Chinese scholars in the early twentieth century was not an innovation on their part but primarily a borrowing from the West via Japan. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, Japanese historians of China had already published many Western-style textbooks on Chinese history, general as well as specialized. Some of these works, such as <i class="calibre9">A General History of China</i><sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-908" id="calibre_link-951" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> by Naka Michiyo (1851&ndash;1908) and <i class="calibre9">Oriental History</i> by Kuwabara Jitsuzo,<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-909" id="calibre_link-952" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> exerted an inspiring influence on Chinese historians. The latter work, published in 1898, was immediately translated into Chinese and enjoyed great success in the Chinese academic world.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-910" id="calibre_link-953" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> In their own writings, Zhang Binglin, Liang Qichao, and Liu Shipei also openly acknowledged their indebtedness to many Japanese sinologists. It may at first sight seem strange that a group of scholars professedly devoted to the preservation of China’s national essence should rely so heavily on Western conceptual schemes and methods for the study of their own history, but they were fully aware of the apparent contradiction and justified their endeavor by defining “national essence” in the broadest possible terms. Criticizing the Japanese scholar Inoue Kaoru (1835&ndash;1915), who identified “national essence” as something entirely indigenous, Huang Jie remarked that ‘ “national essence” consists not only in “what is indigenous and suitable, but also in what is borrowed and adaptable to the needs of our nation.” As one of the editorial rules of the <i class="calibre9">National Essence Journal</i> makes abundantly clear, “with regard to Western learning, we shall also elucidate all those new theories and special insights that prove to be capable of illuminating Chinese learning.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-911" id="calibre_link-954" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup> The changing conceptions of national history in twentieth-century China have, to a considerable degree, been related to the various Western ideas and approaches that have dominated the community of historians at different times.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The National Essence group was the first generation of historians to carry out historical research and writing under the conceptual framework of “national history.” The search for a new identity for China as a “nation” in a Western-dominated world led them naturally to inquire about the origins of the Chinese race and civilization. In the 1880s, the French scholar Terrien de LaCouperie (1844&ndash;1894) had proposed a theory based on a highly dubious interpretation of Chinese etymology that the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi <span>黃</span><span>帝</span>), supposedly the father of the Chinese race, was actually the generic title of the Kings of Susiana (Nakhunti). According to this theory, in the third millennium <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.,</small> he led a group of Chaldeans known as the “Baks” from Mesopotamia to Central Asia and reached China. Under his leadership, the “Baks” eventually defeated the natives and conquered China. These “Baks,” whom LaCouperie identified with the ruling aristocracy known as <i class="calibre9">baixing</i> <span>百</span><span>姓</span> (Hundred Surnames) in early Confucian texts, were thought to have created the earliest civilization in China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-912" id="calibre_link-955" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> Significantly, nearly all Chinese National Essence historians accepted this theory without showing the slightest sign of embarrassment. Naturally, this strange phenomenon must be understood in the historical context of the National Essence Movement itself, but it can also be explained on other grounds suggested by the following observations.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>First, it showed that the paradigmatic transition from Sinocentric “dynastic history” to “national history” was far more difficult than has generally been assumed. Chinese historians still wanted their history to retain the status of “world history,” as in the past. The theory of Western origins of Chinese race and civilization served this purpose well; China would still be seen as being in the center of the West-dominated modern world, not on the periphery. Thus, Zhang Binglin asserted not only that the Chinese race came from Chaldea, but also that China in high antiquity shared many cultural traits with the Greeks, Romans, Saxons, Franks, and Slavs.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-913" id="calibre_link-956" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> Liu Shipei was even more explicit. He speculated that the Han Chinese and the Caucasians were originally of the same race but later migrated to China and Europe respectively as a result of population expansion.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-914" id="calibre_link-957" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1291" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Second, although National Essence historians accepted the theory about the Western origin of the Chinese race, they did not commit themselves to LaCouperie’s other view that “Chinese culture had been brought in from outside and preserved by the Chinese.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-915" id="calibre_link-958" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> On the contrary, they viewed Chinese culture as something that had evolved in China through the ages. A host of factors had contributed to the gradual formation of a distinctly Chinese culture, among them geography, climate, and even “barbarian” peoples who had invaded China and mixed with the Han Chinese. In thus defining Chinese cultural identity historically, they felt that they could still justifiably speak of a “national essence” even if the Chinese race originally came from the West. The National Essence historians were certainly nationalists, and they also strove to promote Chinese national consciousness by means of historical research and writing. But a deeper look reveals that their nationalism was more related to culture than to race. In this respect, there was continuity between the “dynastic history” tradition and the “national history” paradigm.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Third, the National Essence Movement has been persistently interpreted as a conservative strain in modern Chinese intellectual history. To judge by the readiness with which it embraced the theory of the Western origin of the Chinese race, however, National Essence historiography showed a remarkable openness to new ideas. It is noteworthy as well that Zhang Binglin and Liu Shipei were among the earliest Chinese historians to apply sociological theories, especially of the Spencerian variety, to the study of Chinese history. They were equally receptive to many of the basic values in modern Western culture such as “democracy,” “equality,” and “human rights.” However, they took these as universal values and insisted on their genesis in early China independently of the West. Much of National Essence historiography deals with these themes. Liu Shipei’s <i class="calibre9">Zhongguo minyue jingyi</i> <span>中</span><span>國</span><span>民</span><span>約</span><span>精</span><span>義</span> (Essentials of the Chinese Theory of Social Contract; 1934),<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-916" id="calibre_link-959" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> for example, traces the genesis and evolution of Chinese democratic ideas from philosophical writings of classical antiquity all the way to thinkers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It seems to make better sense to say that National Essence historians by and large tried to justify Western values in terms of Chinese tradition rather than the other way around. Taking the idea of social evolution as their fundamental assumption, they were primarily interested in the particular ways and forms in which cultural changes had taken place in China through various historical stages. In speaking of the evolution of Chinese literature, for instance, Liu Shipei observed that vernacular prose had been steadily gaining popularity since the Song dynasty and that through the influence of the popular novel, it would eventually dominate Chinese prose writing. “It is in the nature of evolution,” he said, “that things generally develop from simple to complex, and literature is certainly no exception.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-917" id="calibre_link-960" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> In this, Liu actually anticipated Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962)’s advocacy of vernacular literature by more than a decade. By the time of the May Fourth Movement of 1919, there may have been good reasons to regard Zhang Binglin and Liu Shipei as political and cultural conservatives, as many people actually did. But prior to the Revolution of 1911, National Essence historians must be recognized as pioneers who opened up the vast field of Chinese history along various new lines of investigation and who, above all, laid the groundwork for a bold modern program to study Chinese history as “national history.”</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">4</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1204" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>An intellectual movement known as the Systematic and Critical Study of the National Past (<i class="calibre9">zhengli guogu</i> <span>整</span><span>理</span><span>國</span><span>故</span>) constituted the academic core of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, of which Hu Shi was an acknowledged leader. The term “national past” (<i class="calibre9">guogu</i>) suggests both its continuity with and its departure from the “national essence” (<i class="calibre9">guocui</i> <span>國</span><span>粹</span>) movement. Indeed, it was Zhang Binglin who in 1910 first adopted this term as the title for a collection of his learned essays, <i class="calibre9">Guogu lunheng</i> <span>國</span><span>故</span><span>論</span><span>衡</span> (Critical Essays on the National Past), originally published in the <i class="calibre9">National Essence Journal</i>. Clearly, unlike “national essence,” which implies a positive value judgment, “national past” is a neutral term. This subtle change is symptomatic of the radical antitraditionalistic mood of the May Fourth era.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The National Past Movement was almost as exclusively concerned with the study of Chinese history as the National Essence Movement, but its influence was far more enduring and widespread. It lasted roughly from 1917 to the 1930s, dominating the mainstream of Chinese historiography during this time. Several important factors contributed to the great popularity of the National Past Movement. First, it was an integral part of the New Culture Movement, which, since May 4, 1919, had penetrated every corner of the Chinese intellectual world. Second, thanks to the literary revolution of 1917, the vernacular had since then replaced classical language as the writing medium. The scholarly writings of Zhang Binglin and Lin Shipei in the <i class="calibre9">National Essence Journal</i>, with their difficult classical style and sometimes archaic forms of Chinese characters, could be appreciated only by a very small elite circle. By contrast, new studies of Chinese history and classics written in the vernacular since 1917 reached a nationwide audience at practically all levels. Hu Shi’s <i class="calibre9">Zhongguo zhexueshi dagang</i> <span>中</span><span>國</span><span>哲</span><span>學</span><span>史</span><span>大</span><span>綱</span> (Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy, Shanghai: Shangwu), the first serious work on logic and philosophy in classical China written in the vernacular, for instance, underwent a second printing within two months of its publication in 1919. Third, the National Essence circle, based in Shanghai and Tokyo, could claim no more than fifty active members, including its journal’s founders as well as contributors. In contrast, participants in the National Past Movement came from all parts of China, and they were numerous. In this connection, mention must also be made of the changed institutional structure of the Chinese academic world. By the early 1920s, many modern universities and colleges existed in China at which a large number of professionally trained historians and humanists secured teaching and research positions. It was largely these well-trained scholars who carried on with dedication and perseverance the systematic and critical investigations of China’s national past.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1007" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The tone of the National Past Movement was initially set by Hu Shi, whose <i class="calibre9">Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy</i> was enthusiastically and widely accepted as something of an exemplar in the National Past historiography. Under the influence of Deweyan pragmatism and Anglo-American “scientific history,” he advocated more emphatically than anybody else the central importance of scientific methodology for the study of Chinese history. His study of ancient Chinese philosophy is characterized in particular by skepticism, critical spirit, and methodological rigor. He shocked everybody, first in his class lectures at Peking University and then in his book, by beginning the history of Chinese philosophy with Laozi and Confucius, thereby dismissing the long-established genealogy of pre-Confucian sages as historically unreliable. He justified this bold move on the grounds that the genealogy and the various ideas attributed to those sages are based on texts whose authenticity is very much in question.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-918" id="calibre_link-961" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> Thus, Hu chopped off the first half of Chinese history as given in traditional historiography. It may be recalled that less than a decade earlier, National Essence historians still took the Yellow Emperor very seriously as the ancestor of the Chinese race. Even a critically minded historian such as Xia Zengyou <span>夏</span><span>曾</span><span>佑</span> (1863&ndash;1924), who, as a follower of Kang Youwei <span>康</span><span>有</span><span>為</span> (1858&ndash;1927), took most of the Old Text Confucian classics to be spurious, did not hesitate to say in his justly famed <i class="calibre9">Zhongguo gudai shi</i> (Ancient History of China; 1904) that “the authentic history of China began in the age of the Yellow Emperor.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-919" id="calibre_link-962" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As a historian, Hu Shi was no iconoclast. Like Liang Qichao and Zhang Binglin, who, as he openly acknowledged, introduced him to Chinese intellectual history through their writings, Hu Shi was also deeply troubled by the question of China’s identity as a nation vis-à-vis the modern West. As he wrote in English in 1917:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>How can we Chinese feel at ease in this new world which at first sight appears to be so much at variance with what we have long regarded as our own civilization? For it is perfectly natural and justifiable that a nation with a glorious past and a distinctive civilization of its own making should never feel quite at home in a new civilization, if that civilization is looked upon as part and parcel imported from alien lands and forced upon by external necessities of national existence. And it surely would be a great loss to mankind at large if the acceptance of this civilization should take the form of abrupt displacement instead of organic assimilation, thereby causing the disappearance of the old civilization.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The real problem, therefore, may be restated thus: How can we best assimilate modern civilization in such a manner as to make it congenial and congruous and continuous with the civilization of our own making?<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-920" id="calibre_link-963" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1206" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>If we accept this statement as true, then his intention was really to enrich as well as revitalize Chinese tradition by means of cultural assimilation rather than to destroy or displace it.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-921" id="calibre_link-964" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> Since this ambitious project required a true understanding of Chinese culture from the outset, he placed the study of China’s past high on the agenda of the New Culture Movement. In an influential essay of 1919, he defined the significance of New Culture as a “critical spirit.” Under this “critical spirit,” he emphasized, there were three important tasks to be performed simultaneously, namely, to study problems immediately faced by China, to familiarize the Chinese intellectual community with new ideas, theories, and scholarly findings developed in the West, and last but not least, to subject the National Past to a comprehensive, systematic, and scientifically rigorous reexamination and reorganization.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-922" id="calibre_link-965" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup> To carry out the last of these three tasks, he founded two journals, <i class="calibre9">Dushu zazhi</i> <span>讀</span><span>書</span><span>雜</span><span>誌</span> (Reading Magazine) and <i class="calibre9">Guoxue jikan</i> <span>國</span><span>學</span><span>季</span><span>刊</span> (National Studies Quarterly), in 1921 and 1923, respectively. <i class="calibre9">Reading Magazine</i> was a semipopular journal intended for the young, whereas <i class="calibre9">National Studies Quarterly</i> was an academic journal published by Peking University. Each of these two influential journals contributed in its own way to the emergence of a wholly new conception of Chinese history. The seeds of doubt about the historicity of the genealogy of the sage-kings in high antiquity sown by Hu Shi soon grew to a conviction. In 1922, Gu Jiegang (1893&ndash;1980), a leading disciple of Hu Shi, began to publish his systematic studies on Chinese antiquity in <i class="calibre9">Reading Magazine</i>. His central hypothesis was that most of the sage-kings in Confucian classics are actually legendary and symbolic figures. Following the methodology developed by Hu Shi in the study of Chinese novels, he traced the evolution of legends through the ages and showed how they grew as details were fabricated to enlarge them at an ever-increasing pace with every generation. In this first article, he dissected the legend of the sage-king Yu, founder of the Xia dynasty (approximately 2200&ndash;1750 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>) and came to the startling conclusion that Yu was probably a totemic symbol. This little piece of scholarship touched a most sensitive spot in Chinese national consciousness and a heated nationwide controversy immediately broke out among historians. The “Critique of Ancient History,” as the controversy has been called, lasted for more than a decade and produced seven huge collections of essays entitled <i class="calibre9">Gushi bian</i> <span>古</span><span>史</span><span>辨</span> (Critiques of Ancient History; 1926&ndash;1941) and many monographs.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-923" id="calibre_link-966" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Like his teacher Hu Shi, Gu was not by temperament an iconoclastic radical. Nor was his intention merely to demolish the Golden Age of China’s high antiquity for its own sake. On the contrary, his final aim was the reconstruction of an authentic history of ancient China, which, he believed, was possible only after fabricated history had been fully exposed. As was well summed up by Lawrence A. Schneider:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Clearly, Ku [Gu] was a destroyer of traditional conceptions of the past and, concomitantly, the values for which these conceptions acted as vessels. However, implicit in all of his wide-ranging work has been a persistent drive to reconstruct a past which is consistent with his twentieth-century epistemology and sense of history, and, at the same time, consistent with his will to retain a Chinese identity for a twentieth-century China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-924" id="calibre_link-967" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1407" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This said, it must also be pointed out that Gu’s as well as Hu Shi’s conscious efforts to “shorten Chinese history by two to three thousand years”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-925" id="calibre_link-968" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> did have important iconoclastic implications. To cultural conservatives, it meant the undermining of the spiritual foundation of Chinese culture, and to radicals, it was a message that nothing in the Chinese tradition was too sacred to be protected from revolution. Since the publication of the first volume of Gu’s <i class="calibre9">Critiques of Ancient History</i> in 1926, conceptions of Chinese history, particularly ancient history, have been fundamentally modified. In the first place, there has arisen a consensus among historians that authentic recorded history in China began only with the Shang dynasty (approximately 1750&ndash;1100 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.),</small> especially the latter part of the dynasty, which has been authenticated by the newly discovered oracle bone inscriptions. Critically minded historians have generally tended to regard the Xia dynasty as “legendary.” Even today, when archaeology argues favorably for a Xia civilization either antecedent to the Shang dynasty or contemporaneous with both Shang and Zhou in their predynastic antiquity, many specialists&mdash;historians and archaeologists alike&mdash;still hesitate to confirm the historicity of Xia because of the absence of direct written evidence comparable to Shang inscriptions. In the second place, the emphasis on the necessity of subjecting historical data to a most rigorous “scientific” examination before any reconstruction of the past can be attempted soon became a universal creed for Chinese historians of all persuasions. Even the Marxist historian Guo Moruo, who was normally against everything Hu Shi and his school stood for, specifically praised Gu Jiegang in 1930, for his critical study of forgeries.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-926" id="calibre_link-969" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup> As a result, however, skepticism ran high and almost every single Chinese text was called into question. This hypercritical attitude eventually led, in the 1920s and 1930s, to a general conviction that Chinese historical texts, abundant as they are, are neither sufficient nor reliable enough for historical reconstruction. The work of Wang Guowei <span>王</span><span>國</span><span>維</span> (1877&ndash;1927) was held as a model for emulation by all Chinese historians of the time, traditional and new, conservative and radical, not only because of the genius and erudition of its author but also because it largely resulted from careful and meticulous comparisons of old Chinese texts with newly discovered or non-Chinese sources.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-927" id="calibre_link-970" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> In 1924, Wang himself also pointed out that the new learning developed in China since the turn of the century arose directly out of the new discoveries of new sources, such as Shang inscriptions, Han wooden documents, Dunhuang manuscripts, Ming-Qing archives, and non-Chinese records.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-928" id="calibre_link-971" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup> In the same year when Hu Shi was working on the history of Chan (Zen) Buddhism, it suddenly occurred to him that his Chinese texts must have suffered from all sorts of fabrications and distortions and therefore could not possibly be relied upon for such an endeavor. He had to search for new source material among the Dunhuang manuscripts preserved in Paris and London.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-929" id="calibre_link-972" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1068" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>One thing led to another and in the mid-1920s, when Hu Shi was pushing to broaden the database of Chinese historiography, he had the good fortune to find another of his leading disciples, Fu Sinian <span>傅</span><span>斯</span><span>年</span> (1896&ndash;1950), just about ready to undertake this formidable task. After graduating from Peking University, Fu Sinian went abroad for several years to study history and other related subjects, first in London and then in Berlin. While abroad, he was exposed to the idea of “scientific history,” ultimately traceable to Ranke, and developed a passion for facts, sources, and archives. He emphasized the importance of philology and primary sources to the study of history, and in 1943, he specifically referred to Ranke and Theodor Mommsen as his Western guides.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-930" id="calibre_link-973" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup> In 1928, he was appointed as director of the newly founded Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica and with government backing, was able to collect historical as well as archaeological data, new and old, in a systematic way and on a large scale. He carried Wang Guowei’s and Hu Shi’s idea about new data to the extreme. In the inaugural issue of the prestigious and influential <i class="calibre9">Bulletin of the Institute of History and Philology</i>, he proclaimed: “Modern historiography is merely the study of historical data, using all the tools provided by natural sciences to put into order all the available historical data…. What we pay the most attention to is the acquisition of new data…. In short, we are not book readers. We go all the way to Heaven above and to Yellow Spring below, using our hands and feet, to look for things.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-931" id="calibre_link-974" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup> The last sentence quoted is almost certainly an adaptation of G. M. Trevelyan’s famous saying: “Collect the facts of the French Revolution! You must go down to Hell and up to Heaven to fetch them.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-932" id="calibre_link-975" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup> Fu’s identification of “modern historiography” with “the study of historical data” has earned him the name “Dataist,” with those sharing his views about modern historiography constituting the “Data school.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-933" id="calibre_link-976" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup> An adherent of logical positivism, Fu modeled his “scientific history” closely on the natural sciences, especially biology and geology.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-934" id="calibre_link-977" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup> This is also true of Hu Shi and Gu Jiegang, though to a lesser degree. Applying their strictly defined ideas of “scientific objectivity” and “evidential investigation” to the study of Chinese history, they were often able to produce fine piecemeal scholarship, but on the whole, they shunned generalizations. They seemed to subscribe to the view that the “ultimate history” would emerge by itself when all the relevant individual facts had been firmly established. This perhaps explains why Hu Shi often resorted to “suspension of judgment” as a last defense when he was hard pressed to answer larger historical questions. Chinese “scientific historians,” including Hu, Gu, Fu, and their numerous followers, have often been criticized, especially by Marxists, as seeing only the trees but no forest. For a militant Dataist such as Fu Sinian, however, it is not even clear whether he would accord the “forest” an ontic status in his historical epistemology. As he remarked of speculative historians, “they are the ones who mistake some clouds in the sky for forests on the horizon.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-935" id="calibre_link-978" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1117" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Hu Shi, Gu Jiegang, and Fu Sinian were the three dominant figures in mainstream Chinese historiography from 1917 to 1937, as Liang Qichao, Zhang Binglin, and Liu Shipei had been before them. Together they succeeded in demolishing the unrealistic traditional conception of Chinese history. However, since they were unable or unwilling to build a new one in its place, China was left with a much fragmented historical identity.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">5</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>In retrospect, the two decades between 1917 and 1937 truly deserve to be called the golden age of Chinese historiography. Not only was there strong institutional support for research and an abundance of new source materials, but the historical profession as a whole was also held in high esteem. In the wake of the New Culture Movement, historians generally enjoyed a high degree of intellectual freedom, at least during the 1920s. All sorts of conceptual schemes&mdash;conservative, radical, and middle-of-the-road&mdash;were formulated to study Chinese history. As a result, never before or after in this century have so many Chinese talents been attracted to the historical profession.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The preceding section has focused on mainstream Chinese historiography of this period mainly because of its immense influence, but this is not to suggest that mainstream conceptions were everywhere accepted in the community of historians. Nor were there unifying conceptions among mainstream historians. Hu Shi, Gu Jiegang, and Fu Sinian, when examined individually and in close detail, were very different from one another and did not even necessarily practice what they preached. This divergence is well illustrated by two towering figures in mainstream historiography, Chen Yuan <span>陳</span><span>垣</span> (1880&ndash;1971) and Chen Yinke <span>陳</span><span>寅</span><span>恪</span> (1890&ndash;1969). In their emphasis on the importance of new data and textual criticism to the study of history, both were very much at home in mainstream historiography. Indeed, both were officially associated with Fu Sinian’s Institute of History and Philology before 1949. However, each developed a distinct conception of his own. Chen Yuan was more in the tradition of Qing philology but sufficiently modern to undertake middle-range monographic studies on religious history as opposed to the “shreds and patches” of a Dataist kind. Chen Yinke was thoroughly trained in philosophy, history, Buddhology, and classical languages in Berlin, in Paris, and at Harvard. His extraordinary erudition combined with a critical and sharp mind made him a legend in his own time. Yet he was so deeply committed to traditional Chinese values that Western ideas associated with the New Culture Movement were anathema to him. His wide-ranging study of the middle period between the third and tenth centuries in a broad East Asian context led him to see a unique rhythm of change in Chinese social and cultural history. He skillfully combined textual criticism with a hermeneutical approach. Thus, on the one hand, he paid every attention to the most minute details of his textual evidence, and yet on the other, he did not eschew interpretation when necessary.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1118" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In this connection, brief mention must also be made of Chinese Marxist historiography, which lies beyond the scope of this study. With the exception of Kuo Moruo’s <i class="calibre9">Zhongguo gudai shehui yanjiu</i> <span>中</span><span>國</span><span>古</span><span>代</span><span>社</span><span>會</span><span>研</span><span>究</span> (Studies of Ancient Chinese Society; Shijiazhuang: Hebei jiaoyu chubanshe, 2004 [1930]), which was modeled on Engels’s <i class="calibre9">The Origin of the Family</i>, <i class="calibre9">Private Property and the State</i> (1884), Chinese Marxists failed to produce works of importance to historical scholarship during this period. It is true that between 1928 and 1933, the Social History Controversy not only familiarized Chinese historians with the Marxist theory of history but also made them fully aware of its relevance to the study of Chinese history. In reality, however, this controversy was about revolution rather than history. Both Marxist and non-Marxist participants in the controversy needed to determine the exact historical state (according to the Marxist scheme) at which China then found itself so that a certain type of political action could be taken with justification. Moreover, a central figure in the Social History controversy, Tao Xisheng <span>陶</span><span>希</span><span>聖</span>, was not a Marxist but a legal historian who drew his inspiration from Henry Maine’s <i class="calibre9">Ancient Law</i> (first published in 1861).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-936" id="calibre_link-979" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup> Ironically, it was largely through the influence of Tao, an enemy of Chinese Marxism, that Marxist concepts and methods gradually gained access to academic historiography. In the early 1930s, Tao joined the Faculty of Law at Peking University and founded <i class="calibre9">Shihhuo</i> <span>食</span><span>貨</span> (Food and Money [Commodities]) magazine to promote the study of Chinese social and economic history. He was able to attract a number of talented young scholars in mainstream historiography to this vast new field. Judging by their published work, Marxist historians in China were hardly distinguishable from revolutionary propagandists before the 1940s. Still, it was undeniable that with its emphasis on the social and economic base, the Marxist approach to history did provide Chinese historians with a vantage point from which their nation’s past could be reconstructed in an entirely new way.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1127" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>By the early 1930s, China was already deep in the national crisis that eventually culminated in the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in 1937. Historians responded to the crisis quickly, though the response varied from one to the other, as the following few examples illustrate. To everybody’s surprise, the Dataist Fu Sinian rushed to produce an outline history of northeastern China (i.e., Manchuria) right after Japan had seized the region in 1931, only to be severely criticized for its numerous scholarly imperfections. In the mid-1930s, Gu Jiegang also turned to the study of frontier history and ethnic minorities with the explicit purpose of promoting patriotic feeling and national solidarity. He spent the whole academic year of 1937&ndash;1938 traveling in the northwestern frontier provinces. Chen Yinke finished his political history of the Tang dynasty in Hong Kong in 1940. In this brilliant work, he specifically stressed the point that the fate of Tang China was interlocked with the rise and fall of neighboring peoples. He also demonstrated the close interaction between civil government and national defense at this time, with effective defense often depending on good government. While living in Peking under the Japanese occupation, Chen Yuan wrote to a friend in free China in 1943 that historians in Peking had turned their research in a new direction since 1937. Now, he said, they would not write on any historical topic without some relevance to the national crisis.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-937" id="calibre_link-980" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>After 1937, many leading historians turned away from narrow research topics and devoted themselves wholeheartedly to the writing of general histories of China. Two monumental works were <i class="calibre9">Guoshi dagang</i> <span>國</span><span>史</span><span>大</span><span>綱</span> (Outline History of the Nation; Taipei: Guoli bianyiguan, 1940) by Qian Mu <span>錢</span><span>穆</span> (1895&ndash;1990) and <i class="calibre9">Zhongguo shigang</i> <span>中</span><span>國</span><span>史</span><span>綱</span> (Outline of Chinese History; Chongqing: Qingnian shudian, 1941) by Zhang Yinlin <span>張</span><span>蔭</span><span>麟</span> (1906&ndash;1942). The first, in particular, deserves attention. Through his <i class="calibre9">Outline History</i>, Qian delivered a powerful message to his fellow Chinese. He did not deny that China at the present time was sick, but as a historian, his faith in China was unbounded. China, he assured the reader, not only had a great past, but would have a still more glorious future if only its people chose to fight for their national identity. Various nationalistic ideas and feelings, essentially of a cultural sort, were skillfully blended with historical material in his text and the result was a magnificent epic. Needless to say, his <i class="calibre9">Outline History</i> was, from its very conception, designed and formulated in an effort to arouse the deeply humiliated China of his day. In this regard, it is not wholly dissimilar to Fichte’s <i class="calibre9">Reden an die Deutsche Nation</i> (1808), which in Chinese translations had attracted numerous readers. The publication of the <i class="calibre9">Outline History</i> caused something of a furor, for it provoked strong and immediate response from all sides. Marxists and Dataists, as expected, attacked it bitterly and relentlessly. Yet it was also showered with praise. At any rate, it has gone through numerous printings and is still widely read not only by college students but by laypeople as well in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other Chinese overseas communities. The spirit of this modern classic in Chinese historiography has been captured by Jerry Dennerline, who describes it as follows:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1305" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The history [Qian] Mu produced in this detached setting was a monument to national pride. Drawing on the author’s thorough familiarity with the histories, the classics, the institutional compendia and the literature of the past, it describes a pattern of native expansion and contraction, imperial coercion and amelioration, economic, social and intellectual evolution over a period of three thousand years. The pattern, according to [Qian] Mu, is China’s, and it differs from the West’s as a poem differs from a drama. The one develops in a meter from rhyme, always by the same rules; the other develops in stages, from act to act, always with a different end plot. The one expands to fill a space when it is ordered and disintegrates when it is not. The other progresses from conflict to conflict toward some inevitable tragic conclusion. The historians who tried to understand the course of Chinese history by applying Western science were right to look for facts. In this regard they surpassed the New Text revisionists. But they failed to comprehend that their theories presumed the universality of the dramatic form.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-938" id="calibre_link-981" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">43</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="indent"><span>Throughout his life as a historian, Qian Mu had been torn between the universal and the particular, as well as between the Western and the Chinese. Implicitly or explicitly, Chinese historians with a positivistic inclination, from Liang Qichao through Hu Shi and Fu Sinian to the Marxist, have all assumed that in the study of Chinese history, universal laws or models can only be provided by the scientific West while the particularity of historical data must of necessity remain Chinese. Now what Qian Mu was contending seems to amount to this: Is it possible to see in Chinese history and in Western history two distinct patterns, say, as between a poem and a drama? Even if history is a science, no more and no less, it is, after all, an empirical as opposed to a theoretical science. If we are committed to seeking “universal laws” or to building “universal models” in history, is it too much to ask that any such attempt also take into full account the historical experiences of China? Must we always take a Procrustean approach by making the Chinese evidence fit Western theories? With these questions, the present inquiry must come to a close, at least for the time being.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1071" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith a historiographical tradition as long and variegated as China’s, any attempt at a sweeping generalization of Chinese historical thought with a view to clearly distinguishing it from its Western counterpart is hazardous. To suggest that there are essential determinate characteristics in Chinese historiography that are wholly absent in the West is to lapse into a false essentialism. The more I know about the history of Western historiography, the less I am sure about the possibility of drawing a sharp distinction between the two traditions. As far as the individual component parts of Chinese and Western historiographies are concerned, they appear to be more similar than dissimilar. On the other hand, however, the shapes of the two traditions do look different when viewed historically. I am inclined to believe that the differences lie in constellation and emphasis, which, if further investigated, may turn out to be, to a large extent, culturally determined.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Peter Burke’s ten-point characterization of historical thought and historical writing in the West provides me with a good starting point for some reflections on the Chinese tradition in a comparativist light.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2338" id="calibre_link-2396" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> In what follows, I shall choose to discuss only a few interrelated ideas that may be considered central to traditional Chinese historiography.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1255" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Burke is quite right to suggest that the most important characteristic of Western historical thought is its stress on development or progress, which originated in the Judeo-Christian notion of Destiny or Providence. E. H. Carr also pointed out, “It was the Jews, and after them the Christians, who introduced an entirely new element by postulating a goal towards which the historical process is moving&mdash;the teleological view of history.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2339" id="calibre_link-2397" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> Burke further notes, citing Karl Löwith, “modern concepts of historical development may be viewed as secular forms of these religious ideas.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2340" id="calibre_link-2398" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> However, I wish to make the observation that it is precisely in its secular forms that this Judeo-Christian idea of “development” or “progress” has exerted its greatest influence on modern Western historiography. Hegel’s <i class="calibre9">Geist</i> and Marx’s “mode of production” are clearly latter-day successors to the “plan of God.” Paradoxically, the idea has also found its most powerful ally in modern science, which has inspired the intensive search, since the eighteenth century, for universal laws governing the development or progress of history. Thus, Marx, in his preface to <i class="calibre9">Capital</i>, speaks with great confidence of “the natural laws of capitalist production” working “with iron necessity towards inevitable results.” Even the American modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s was also formulated on the assumption of a single process of economic development for all societies. This universal model, needless to say, was built on the Western historical experience since the Industrial Revolution.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The reason I begin my discussion of Chinese historical thinking with this peculiar Western idea of “development” or “progress” is twofold. First, the notion that human history is an irreversible process guided by some transhuman forces such as Divine Providence or natural laws is wholly alien to indigenous Chinese historiography; but, second, it is none other than this strange idea disguised as “science” that has captivated Chinese historical imagination in the twentieth century. Especially with the establishment of Marxism-Leninism as state ideology in 1949, this teleological view of history has become a Procrustean bed on which Chinese history, in all its aspects, must be placed at all times. A central task set for historians by the party is to periodize their national history according to the five-stage theory of social development. While the Marxist approach to history may be credited with discovery of interesting historical data in areas previously neglected in traditional historiography, its total impact on Chinese historical scholarship is rather disastrous: Chinese history has been falsified, misinterpreted, and distorted on a massive scale. As a result, today a new generation of Chinese historians is beginning to question practically every large generalization about Chinese history established during the past decades. There are also signs of a revival of interest in traditional historiography on its own terms.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1074" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the last few years of the twentieth century, a noticeable intellectual movement grew up in China to celebrate the first generations of historians who made a systematic attempt to recognize Chinese classical and historical scholarship in a modern way in the early decades of the twentieth century. These Great Masters of National Learning, as they came to be called, relied primarily on their traditional training in textual and philological studies to make important new historical discoveries, even though conceptually they had been enlightened by the Western learning of their own day, including natural and social sciences. It has been generally recognized that the great achievements of Chinese historical scholarship in the early Republican Period were a direct outgrowth of the indigenous historiographical tradition, which reached its full maturity in the course of the previous three centuries. The contribution of Western learning during this period lay in the widening of general intellectual horizons rather than in providing Chinese historians with specific historical theories and methods. Indeed, when the Chinese historical mind in the post&ndash;May Fourth Period gradually turned away from its own tradition and looked with ever-growing veneration to theories and practices in Western historiography for guidance, the quality of historical research and writing in China began to deteriorate markedly.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2341" id="calibre_link-2399" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the preface to his last book, <i class="calibre9">The Origins of History</i>, Herbert Butterfield identifies science and historiography as two of the most distinguishing features of Western civilization. According to Butterfield, the only known parallel to it in both respects is to be found in early China. However, the scientific revolution and the historiographical revolution that took place in Europe in the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, respectively, have left China far behind. As a result, “in both fields the Chinese themselves have had to become the pupils of the West.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2342" id="calibre_link-2400" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup> I do not so much disagree with Butterfield’s statement as I would like to qualify it by making a further distinction. It is true that the Chinese of the twentieth century did, of their own accord, become “the pupils of the West” not only in science but in historiography as well. However, Chinese acceptance of Western historiography is fundamentally different from that of Western science. In the latter case, the acceptance is total. As we know only too well, modern Chinese have simply ignored the existence of their own past scientific achievements (as reconstructed in Joseph Needham’s multivolume <i class="calibre9">Science and Civilization in China</i> [1954&ndash;2008]) and started completely anew by following the Western model to its minutest detail. This has been possible because scientific and technological studies in traditional China had been confined to a small coterie of specialists, but were never a part of the general Confucian curriculum. By contrast, for over two thousand years, the Chinese elite had been molded by a type of Confucian education centered around classics and history.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1319" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Moreover, from the twelfth century to the eighteenth, Confucian scholars made a series of methodological breakthroughs in historical research as their critical reexamination of classical and historical texts gradually deepened with time. Writing in 1937, Charles S. Gardner rightly pointed out: “Within the past two decades there has grown up in China a new school of history, new in inspiration, new in historical technique. This school seeks and finds one side of its ancestry among China’s past historians…. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries especially, important advances were made towards the scientific method.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2343" id="calibre_link-2401" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> It is this background that accounts, to a large extent, for the astonishing readiness with which Western historiography was accepted by Chinese historians in the early decades of the twentieth century. As clearly acknowledged by Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962), a leading member of what Gardner calls “a new school of history,” he was able to feel at home “in the new age of modern science” because he had come from “a scientific tradition of dispassionate and disciplined inquiry, of rigorous evidential thinking and investigation, of boldness in doubt and hypothesis coupled with meticulous care in seeking verification.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2344" id="calibre_link-2402" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> He may have somewhat exaggerated his case about the “scientific tradition” in early China, but his inner experience is nevertheless amply borne out by his diary written during his student years in the United States (1911&ndash;1917).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Hence, unlike in science, when modern Chinese became “pupils of the West,” they did not, and could not, come to embrace historiography with minds as clean as tabula rasa. Instead, they looked at Western historiography through the lens of their own tradition, assimilating the “scientific method” to “evidential thinking and investigation” developed by the Qing philologists. They were willing to become “pupils of the West” because they believed that this “scientific method” had been developed to a most advanced state only in the modern West. In actual practice, however, the first generation of Chinese historians were still largely following their own research tradition with only limited innovations and modifications of Western origins.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>At this juncture, allow me to return to the recent discovery of the Great Masters of National Learning by a new generation of Chinese historians, mentioned above. I take it as symptomatic of an awakening on their part that the time has finally arrived for Chinese historians to take stock of what has really happened during their long apprenticeship in Western historiography. From hindsight, it appears very paradoxical that the first generation of historians who were exposed to Western influence only in a limited way have produced historical scholarship now generally judged to be far superior to that of the later generations, who are obviously much more sophisticated in their application of the so-called scientific method. This immediately calls into question the validity of Western historiography as a universal model on a par with natural science. Here, too, the very idea of “scientific method” may well have played a role that was more negative than positive. Excessive obsession with “scientific method” has been particularly characteristic of scientism in modern China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2345" id="calibre_link-2403" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> However, method has turned out to be neither ideologically neutral nor clearly separable from the context in which it originated. As a result, historical terms, categories, and theories unique to Western experience have also been indiscriminately transferred to Chinese historiography along with the so-called scientific method. As rightly observed by Arthur F. Wright, “twentieth-century Chinese historians borrowed methods, then concepts, and finally systems from the West.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2346" id="calibre_link-2404" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-996" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Now, with the close of the twentieth century, historiography in the West, or at least in the United States, has lost its original “vision of a unified and cohesive historical discipline.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2347" id="calibre_link-2405" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> In this allegedly “postmodern” culture of ours in which “chaos” reigns supreme, the historical profession is said to be describable in the last verse of the Book of Judges: “there was no king in Israel.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2348" id="calibre_link-2406" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> History as an academic discipline finds itself in a similar situation in China today. Inspired by a postmodern critique of Orientalism on the one hand and the post&ndash;Cold War struggle for recognition of non-Western cultures on the other, Chinese intellectuals are also beginning to search for spiritual resources in their own tradition. Since the early 1990s, there has been much talk about the “Chinese humanist spirit” and “New Confucianism.” It is in this new climate of opinion that historians have first rediscovered the Great Masters of National Learning and then, through them, moved further back to reexamine the Chinese historiographical tradition in an affirmative mood. This trend is much in evidence in recent Chinese publications.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If we compare traditional Chinese historiography as a whole with theories and practices of history developed in the West since the eighteenth century, the differences are truly striking. Moreover, the comparison inevitably casts the former in an extremely unfavorable light. This is precisely why the eminent historian Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929) proposed in 1902 that the “dynastic history” paradigm in the Chinese tradition be swept aside to make room for a “New History” based essentially on Herbert Spencer’s interpretation of the course of human development as evolution, for he was utterly overwhelmed by the Western style of historical writing as he encountered it while an exile in Japan.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2349" id="calibre_link-2407" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> However, if we take a concrete and analytical approach by comparing two of the earliest Chinese historical works (e.g., Confucius’s <i class="calibre9">Chunqiu</i> <span>春</span><span>秋</span> [Spring and Autumn Annals] with its later commentaries, and Sima Qian’s <i class="calibre9">Shiji</i> <span>史</span><span>記</span> [Records of the Grand Historian]) with two of the earliest works in the West (e.g., Herodotus’s <i class="calibre9">Histories</i> and Thucydides’s <i class="calibre9">History of the Peloponnesian War</i>), the picture that emerges from the comparison would be quite different. As far as underlying assumptions, principles, and methods are concerned, there appear to be as many similarities as differences between the Chinese and the Greek texts.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2350" id="calibre_link-2408" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> For example, an important principle Herodotus followed in his recording of events is the distinction between what he has seen and what he has heard. Thucydides, too, “first trusted his own eyes and ears and next the eyes and ears of reliable witnesses.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2351" id="calibre_link-2409" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> We find the same principle in Confucius’s <i class="calibre9">Annals</i> and Sima Qian’s <i class="calibre9">Records</i>. According to tradition, Confucius distinguished between three types of sources: what he had seen, what he had heard, and what he had learned through transmitted records.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2352" id="calibre_link-2410" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> This is corroborated by his <i class="calibre9">Lunyu</i> (Analects), where he deplored that he was not able to discourse on the rites of the Xia and the Yin dynasties because there were “not enough records and men of erudition” to support him with “evidence” (3.9). Sima Qian also always reports what he has seen and what he has heard from eyewitnesses in addition to the vast amount of written documents at his disposal.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2353" id="calibre_link-2411" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1033" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>To give one more example, Arnaldo Momigliano takes great pride in what he calls the “critical methods” of Greek historians, especially Herodotus and Thucydides. By “critical methods” he means that “the user, after reflection and study, was satisfied as to their reliability.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2354" id="calibre_link-2412" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> He even goes so far as to assert that “no historiography earlier than the Greek or independent of it developed these critical methods.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2355" id="calibre_link-2413" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> However, similar critical methods seem to have been already present in Chinese historiography in the time of Confucius (551&ndash;479 <small class="calibre7">B.C.</small>). Sima Qian tells us that in preparation for his <i class="calibre9">Spring and Autumn Annals</i>, Confucius not only made extensive investigations of old historical records of the royal house of Zhou and edited the texts but also established “meaningful principles” and laid down “methods of writing.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2356" id="calibre_link-2414" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> Confucius’s guiding “principle” for recording events, according to the <i class="calibre9">Guliang Commentary</i> to the <i class="calibre9">Spring and Autumn Annals</i>, was to “transmit what is reliable as reliable and what is doubtful as doubtful.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2357" id="calibre_link-2415" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> True, we can by no means be sure about the accuracy of these statements as descriptions of the <i class="calibre9">Spring and Autumn Annals</i> because they may well have been attributed to Confucius by Confucians of later centuries. Nevertheless, there can be little question that Confucius did exhibit a general critical attitude toward learning along the lines indicated above. In the <i class="calibre9">Analects</i>, he has the following to say to a student: “Use your ears widely but leave out what is doubtful; repeat the rest with caution and you will make few mistakes” (2.17). At any rate, by the fourth century <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> at the latest, a critical consciousness with regard to the reading of historical texts was already highly developed in China. This is nowhere more clearly shown than in the words of Mencius: “If one believed everything in the <i class="calibre9">Shujing</i> [Book of History], it would have been better for the <i class="calibre9">Book</i> not to have existed at all. In the ‘Wu cheng’ chapter, I accept only two or three strips” (<i class="calibre9">Mencius</i> 7B.3).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>There is no need to elaborate on Sima Qian’s <i class="calibre9">Records of the Grand Historian</i>, in which historical criticism can be detected in almost every part of the book. It suffices to quote a few sentences from his famous “Bao Ren-an shu” <span>報</span><span>任</span><span>安</span><span>書</span> (Letter in Reply to Ren-an): “I have gathered up and brought together the old traditions of the world which were scattered and lost. I have examined the deeds and events of the past and investigated the principles behind their successes and failure, their rise and decay, in one hundred and thirty chapters.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2358" id="calibre_link-2416" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> Clearly, the <i class="calibre9">Records</i> qualifies as <i class="calibre9">historia</i> in the sense of “inquiry,” “research,” or “investigation.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2359" id="calibre_link-2417" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1070" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>We can certainly push this kind of parallelism between the two historiographical traditions down to recent centuries. The philological movement and its revolutionary impact on historical research in the early and middle Qing Period, for instance, bears a remarkably high degree of resemblance to the rise of philology in Europe since Lorenzo Valla.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2360" id="calibre_link-2418" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> Burke raises the interesting question about legal metaphors in the Western historiographical tradition and wonders whether historians of other traditions, including the Chinese, have also taken over assumptions from their indigenous legal system. My reply to this question is in the affirmative. As Hu Shi has convincingly shown, Chinese historical methodology known as <i class="calibre9">kaozheng</i> <span>考</span><span>證</span> (evidential investigation) was developed out of the legal system from the twelfth century on. Terms such as “evidence,” “judgment,” and “witness” are all borrowed from the practice of law. While serving as local officials, Confucian scholars often had extensive experience in the administration of justice. Zhu Xi <span>朱</span><span>熹</span> (1130&ndash;1200) stated repeatedly, and in no uncertain terms, that a scholar must deal with his texts as if he were a judge struggling with a very difficult and complicated litigation. He must listen with an open mind to the presentation of all sides and check the legal documents carefully with special attention given to the possibilities of forgery and anachronism, the two methods often decisive for reaching a reasonable judgment in lawsuits.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2361" id="calibre_link-2419" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> Even in the highly speculative domain commonly called “philosophy of history,” parallelism also existed between China and the West. Zhang Xuecheng <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span> (1738&ndash;1801), for example, developed ideas about history that may be fruitfully compared to those of Vico and Collingwood, though the historical and intellectual contexts are vastly different.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2362" id="calibre_link-2420" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1320" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Now, allow me turn to the other side of the coin, namely, some of the central features that distinguish Chinese historical thought from its Western counterpart. The differences are many and fundamental. Due to space and time limitations, however, I can only offer a few general observations without elaboration. To being with, I wish to stress the point that the differences cannot be located in the historiographical domain itself. Instead, they may be shown to have been deeply rooted in the two distinct cultural traditions of China and the West. In this connection, I wish to say a word about the origins of historical writing in ancient China. Butterfield was impressed by the fact that as early as well before 1000 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>, the character <i class="calibre9">shi</i> <span>史</span> (historian) already appeared in China. <i class="calibre9">Shi</i> could be translated in many ways, such as “scribe,” “archivist,” “historiographer,” or “astrologer,” depending on the text in which it appeared.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2363" id="calibre_link-2421" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> The discovery of thousands and thousands of oracle bone inscriptions datable roughly between 1300 to 1100 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> has amply confirmed this early origin of <i class="calibre9">shi</i> as a “scribe” or “archivist.” The practice of divination involved several individuals: the <i class="calibre9">zhenren</i> <span>貞</span><span>人</span>, who made the inquiry on behalf of the king; the <i class="calibre9">buren</i> <span>卜</span><span>人</span>, who carried out the divining act; the <i class="calibre9">zhanren</i> <span>占</span><span>人</span>, or prognosticator, who specialized in the interpretation of the cracks on the burned bones or shells; and, finally, the <i class="calibre9">shi</i> scribe or archivist, who inscribed the notations.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2364" id="calibre_link-2422" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup> However, at this early date, the function of the <i class="calibre9">shi</i> was clearly religious and cannot be interpreted as “historiographer.” It was probably in the late seventh century <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> at the latest that the <i class="calibre9">shi</i> was gradually transformed from an archivist in charge of religious matters to a court historiographer. Confucius, for example, praised one such <i class="calibre9">shi</i> who had, in 605 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>, shown the moral courage of recording the truth at the risk of his own life. He was, Confucius said, “a good historiographer of old time: his rule for writing was not to conceal.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2365" id="calibre_link-2423" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> From the above account, a few observations may be made with a view of distinguishing the Chinese historiographical tradition from its Western counterpart. First, Chinese historiography began at a very early date and grew up in a remarkably long and continuous tradition. Second, from the very beginning, it was inseparable from official archives and documents. Third, the office of <i class="calibre9">shi</i>, already in existence as a hereditary and prestigious institution by Western Zhou times (1027?&ndash;771 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>), placed the court historiographer at the very center of the Chinese political world.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In light of these unique beginnings of Chinese historical writing, it is little wonder that historiography occupied a central place in Confucian learning throughout the traditional period. This contrasts sharply with the Western cultural context in classical antiquity in which historiography was accorded a secondary place at best. The following succinct characterization of the Greek attitude toward historiography by Momigliano is worth quoting for the purpose of comparison:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The Greeks liked history, but never made it the foundation of their lives. The educated Greek turned to rhetorical schools, to mystery cults, or to philosophy for guidance. History was never an essential part of the life of a Greek&mdash;not even (one suspects) for those who wrote it. There may be many reasons for this attitude of the Greeks, but surely an important factor was that history was so open to uncertainties, so unlikely to provide undisputed guidance.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2366" id="calibre_link-2424" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-997" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>I am tempted to extend this characterization to cover the cultural tradition of the West as a whole, needless to say, only for the purpose of sharpening the contrast between China and the West. Very impressionistically speaking, it seems to me that the Western mind has always been looking to philosophy or religion for spiritual guidance. It turns sometimes more to philosophy and sometimes more to religion, but most of the time, a combination of both. Since the seventeenth century, of course, science has been ever-increasingly made the foundation of Westerners’ lives, even though it has not succeeded completely in replacing religion and philosophy altogether. In this regard, however, science may also be viewed as being continuous with religion and philosophy in the sense that all three are ultimately concerned with the search for “certainty.” As far as my limited knowledge goes, Western historiography over the many centuries has advanced by being nourished and enriched by the religious, philosophical, and scientific developments at every new turn. By contrast, Chinese historiography has grown together with Confucian classical scholarship and literary art. But I must hasten to point out that the intellectual emphasis on a holistic approach in the Chinese tradition has made the trio practically undifferentiated and undifferentiable; the relationship between them can by no means be understood in terms of the Western system of classification of knowledge. Of the so-called Six Classics, two are clearly historical and one literary in nature, if we follow the Western system. The idea that “all classics are history” had long been in currency before Zhang Xuecheng gave it a definitive reformulation.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2367" id="calibre_link-2425" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> The point I wish to emphasize here is that any fruitful comparison between Chinese and Western historical ideas must, of necessity, take into full account the two different cultural traditions in which they originated and grew, respectively.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To the best of my judgment, fundamental to Chinese historical thought is the centrality of human agency in the making of history. By this I do not mean the naive view that man, and man alone, makes history as he wills. It is rather the principle that whatever other forces&mdash;natural or supernatural&mdash;may have been at work in the course of history, the historian’s chief attention must always be directed at the human factor, for it is his business to find out which individuals or groups were responsible, positively or negatively, for certain states of affairs, especially at some critical moments in history such as the rise or fall of a state or dynasty. This special emphasis on the role of human agency in history was in all likelihood related to what is generally referred to as the rise of Confucian humanism during the sixth century <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> In 524 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.,</small> a senior contemporary of Confucius made this famous remark: “The Way of Heaven is distant, while that of man is near. We cannot reach to the former; what means have we of knowing it.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2368" id="calibre_link-2426" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup> It is generally accepted today that this casual remark had a profound influence on Confucius’s thinking, which is amply borne out in the <i class="calibre9">Analects</i> (5.13; 6.22). I would like to quote the following conversation between Confucius and Duke Ding of Lu (r. 509&ndash;495) to illustrate the former’s view about the role of human agency in history:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Duke Ding asked, “Is there such a thing as a single saying that can lead a state to prosperity?”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Confucius answered, “A saying cannot quite do that. There is a saying amongst men: ‘It is difficult to be a ruler, and it is not easy to be a subject either.’ If the ruler understands the difficulty of being a ruler, then is this not almost a case of a saying leading the state to prosperity?”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>“Is there such a thing as a saying that can lead the state to ruin?”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Confucius answered, “A saying cannot quite do that. There is a saying amongst men: ‘I do not at all enjoy being a ruler, except for the fact that no one goes against what I say.’ If what he says is good and no one goes against him, good. But if what he says is not good and no one goes against him, then is this not almost a case of a saying leading the state to ruin?” (<i class="calibre9">Analects</i> 13.15)</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>I quote this conversation in full because it was taken so seriously by later historians that they, as a rule, recorded in their writings words with consequences uttered by important individuals. It is quite illuminating to note that Confucius, in both cases, used “cannot quite” and “almost” to modify his statements. This clearly suggests that while he would definitely hold man’s words and deeds responsible for what happened or might happen, he was also fully aware that factors beyond human agency matter in history as well.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1161" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>According to tradition, Confucius was the first historian to establish the principle of praise and blame in Chinese historiography, which, needless to say, is logically implicit in his fundamental notion about the reality of human freedom in history. Of course, the didactic function of history can also be found in many other historiographical traditions, including Western ones. However, none has developed it to so central a place, with such pervasiveness and continuity, as in China. What is even more remarkable is that it not only penetrated, but also grew luxuriantly in the fertile soil of popular culture. Through historical novels and plays such as, especially, <i class="calibre9">Sanguo yanyi</i> <span>三</span><span>國</span><span>演</span><span>義</span> (The Romance of the Three Kingdoms), the principle of praise and blame reached countless readers and audiences since the twelfth century, if not earlier. In the <i class="calibre9">Romance</i>, for instance, it is easy to see the author’s conscious intention to condemn some of the major characters while honoring others.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2369" id="calibre_link-2427" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> Although later historians, fearing that excess in moral judgment would impair historical objectivity, from time to time counseled restraint, the principle has never been wholly rejected in Chinese historiography even to this day. In the Chinese case, the historiographical principle of praise and blame served not only a didactic function but, perhaps more significantly, a critical one as well. Speaking of why Confucius wrote the <i class="calibre9">Spring and Autumn Annals</i>, Sima Qian said:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Confucius realized that his words were not being heeded, nor his doctrines put into practice. So he made a critical judgment of the rights and wrongs of a period of two hundred and forty-two years in order to provide a standard of rules and ceremonies for the world. He criticized the emperors, reprimanded the feudal lords, and condemned the high officials in order to make known the business of a true ruler and that was all. Confucius said, “If I wish to set forth my theoretical judgments, nothing is as good as illustrating them through the depth and clarity of actual events.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2370" id="calibre_link-2428" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1045" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This statement probably represents more Sima Qian’s view than that of Confucius. Understood in this way, we may say that writing history in the Chinese tradition is an act of political and moral criticism. The quoted saying of Confucius surely reminds us of the famous rhetorical formula of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, “History is philosophy teaching by example.” Perhaps in our case, the term “philosophy” should be replaced by “theory of morality.” There can be little question that Sima Qian intended his <i class="calibre9">Records</i> to be also a work of criticism. Through a variety of literary devices, he criticized not only the powerful and the rich of past and present but also the reigning emperor&mdash;Wu Di&mdash;and some of his policies. This is precisely why in 192 <small class="calibre7">C.E.,</small> a high official in the Han court called the <i class="calibre9">Records</i> “a defamatory book.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2371" id="calibre_link-2429" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup> As late as the Qing Period, when the Manchu court launched large-scale political persecutions against the Chinese intelligentsia, it was the historians who suffered the heaviest toll because they were generally under suspicion of using their enormous critical power to question the legitimacy of the Manchu rule in China.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Throughout the traditional age, Chinese historians were able to perform this critical function to a greater or lesser degree, sometimes even in the face of extreme adversity. The noted historian Liu Yizheng <span>柳</span><span>詒</span><span>徵</span> (1880&ndash;1956) takes this function to be a unique feature in the Chinese historiographical tradition and proudly calls it “the authority of the historian.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2372" id="calibre_link-2430" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup> Thus, history may be understood as having provided Confucian scholars with a much-needed critical distance. However, the historian as critic in traditional China may best be understood as what Michael Walzer calls a “connected critic” or “an insider”:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>He is not a detached observer, even when he looks at the society he inhabits with a fresh and skeptical eye. He is not an enemy, even when he is fiercely opposed to this or that prevailing practice or institutional arrangement. His criticism does not require either detachment or enmity, because he finds a warrant for critical engagement in the idealism, even if it is a hypothetical idealism, of the actually existing moral world.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2373" id="calibre_link-2431" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1034" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This critical tradition is so strong that it continues to linger on even to this day. In modern Western thinking, however, moral judgment in history has long been rejected as an obstacle to scientific objectivity. Isaiah Berlin’s powerful defense of praise and blame in his <i class="calibre9">Historical Inevitability</i> (1954) seems to have fallen on deaf ears. In this connection, then, a question inevitably arises, namely, what was the Chinese historian’s attitude toward what we call objectivity? Our answer is that in its own way, Chinese historiography was also very much concerned about the Rankean notion of “What had actually happened?” Truthful recording, as a Chinese historiographical principle, can be traced to pre-Confucian antiquity. Paradoxically, from the Western point of view, value judgment and truthful recording are taken as two sides of the same coin rather than two conflicting principles in the Chinese tradition. Thus, for example, the statement “A minister murdered his king,” if true, expresses a moral judgment and conveys a historical truth at the same time. To state otherwise, such as “The king died,” is to distort a historical fact despite the objectivity of the language. Similarly, when the case is established on evidence, the traditional Chinese historian would say, “Hitler exterminated millions of Jews out of racial hatred,” not, “Millions of Jews died during the Second World War.” To guarantee truthful recording, a remarkable tradition was established in imperial China that the emperor must refrain from reading the diary of his own reign kept by a court historian.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2374" id="calibre_link-2432" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup> Obviously, this historiographical practice was intended to accord the historian the freedom to record “what had actually happened.” Needless to say, tensions of various kinds did exist between the principle of moral judgment and that of truthful recording in the Chinese tradition. On the other hand, however, the Chinese case also suggests the possibility of reopening the issue of whether moralizing history and historical objectivity are as mutually exclusive as has been generally assumed on the model of the natural sciences.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As suggested above, traditional Chinese historiography does recognize the fact that natural or transhuman forces are also at work in history even though its general emphasis was placed on human agency. It is now necessary to pursue this problem a little further in connection with the absence of the teleological view of history in the Chinese tradition. In his above quoted “Letter in Reply to Ren-an,” Sima Qian describes his <i class="calibre9">Records</i> thus: “I wished to examine into all that concerns Heaven and man, to penetrate the changes of the past and present, completing all as the work of one family.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2375" id="calibre_link-2433" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup> A reading of the <i class="calibre9">Records</i> can easily bear him out. There are many cases in the <i class="calibre9">Records</i> that suggest that its author (or authors if we include his father) is constantly weighing factors pertaining to human agency on the one hand, and those pertaining to <i class="calibre9">tian</i>, or “Heaven,” on the other, in his search for answers regarding “changes of the past and present.” But as scholars generally agree, Sima Qian is notoriously vague about the role of “Heaven” in history and he seems to move freely between the two poles of “Heaven” and “Man.” In some cases, he assigns the rise or fall of a state or dynasty to the work of “Heaven,” and in other cases, to human responsibility.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2376" id="calibre_link-2434" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup> This is also true for traditional Chinese historiography as a whole. As Lien-sheng Yang rightly points out:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In traditional terms, the factors were often vaguely grouped into those belonging to <i class="calibre9">Tian</i> “Heaven, or Nature” and those belonging to <i class="calibre9">Jen</i> “Man.” The human factors cited in tradition are usually based on common sense and consequently are easy to understand. The <i class="calibre9">Tian</i> factors, however, are rather slippery for comprehension, often in terms of such semi-mystical concepts as the Five Elements, <i class="calibre9">qiyun</i> “vitality and fortune” or <i class="calibre9">qishu</i> “vitality and number.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2377" id="calibre_link-2435" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-998" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>A reasonable explanation for the vagueness of the Chinese conception of “Heaven” as a transhuman force in history seems to lie in the general belief that Heaven, in its supernatural sense, does not directly interfere with human affairs. Whatever role it plays in history, it is still played through human agency. Mencius already made this point very clear when he said, “The Emperor can recommend a man to Heaven but he cannot make Heaven give this man the Empire.” Mencius then quoted a passage from the <i class="calibre9">Book of History</i>, saying: “Heaven sees with the eyes of its people. Heaven hears with the ears of its people” (5A.5). This quoted saying is obviously a Chinese version of “The voice of the People is the voice of God.” However, unlike the Western God, the Chinese Heaven has no “divine plan” for humankind to carry out in history. Nor would Heaven strike down a state or dynasty out of wrath. Heaven is seen as only passively waiting to review human proposals, accepting good and rejecting bad ones. Thus, the notion of Providence can find no place in Chinese historical thought. Neither Sima Qian nor later historians showed any inclination, as Herodotus did, “to persuade the reader that history conforms to a divine plan.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2378" id="calibre_link-2436" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Following the example of Confucius not to speak of prodigies and gods (<i class="calibre9">Analects</i>, 7.21), Chinese historians generally refrained from making references to the supernatural. A most remarkable example is provided by Sima Guang <span>司</span><span>馬</span><span>光</span> (1019&ndash;1086)’s <i class="calibre9">Zizhi tongjian</i> <span>資</span><span>治</span><span>通</span><span>鑑</span> (Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government), a general history in chronicle form covering the period from 403 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> to 959 <small class="calibre7">C.E.</small> In such a long chronicle, we rarely encounter reports on strange occurrences of a supernatural kind. On the contrary, when evidence is available, he does not hesitate to expose the so-called auspicious omens faked by court flatterers. In a letter to his research associate, he gave specific instructions concerning the inclusion or exclusion of “strange and uncanny happenings” in the early draft of the <i class="calibre9">Comprehensive Mirror</i>. For instance: “Prophecies…which gave rise to slaughter and rebellion should be retained. Ones which wantonly try to show coincidences…need not be recorded.” “If uncanny occurrences give warnings…or if as a result of them something is started…they should be retained. The rest need not be.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2379" id="calibre_link-2437" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup> Clearly, he intended to keep “strange and uncanny happenings” to a minimum even in the first draft; only those that had produced actual consequences in history were to be retained. However, a check of this letter against the <i class="calibre9">Comprehensive Mirror</i> as we now have it further shows that some of the specific “happenings” originally listed for inclusion were also dropped in his final draft. In this long chronicle, as in the <i class="calibre9">Records of the Grand Historian</i>, we cannot find the slightest trace that history is going somewhere&mdash;toward a predestined end. Indeed, some elements of “providence” can be detected in Chinese popular religions, early and late, but they have failed to penetrate the domain of historiography.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As I have pointed out in the beginning of this essay, it is the providential view of history in its modern secular forms that has captivated the Chinese historical mind since the turn of the twentieth century. Ideas such as “progress,” “evolution,” and “development” have been generally accepted by Chinese historians as what Collingwood calls “absolute presuppositions” for the study of history. It is therefore also desirable to direct my reflections on Chinese historical thought to this modern version of historical teleology.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1245" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It seems to me that the modern idea of “progress” is different from its original, religious version in one essential way: The “end,” “goal,” or “purpose” of history is no longer imposed from outside by a transcendent force called God. Instead, it is immanent in history and ceaselessly seeks self-realization from inside. It makes little difference if this prime mover inside history is called “spirit” or “matter.” As long as it pushes to fulfill its own “end,” history moves forward in one, and only one, predetermined direction. As a result, the whole process of history must of necessity take a definite shape or exhibit an overall pattern. In this irreversible process, individual human beings and their personal intentions and beliefs are of no importance, for they are not fundamentally different from molecules and their consciousnesses are false. They exist only as means for this prime mover to realize itself in history.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If we take the modern teleological view of history as thus caricatured, then we must say that it is just as alien to the Chinese historical mind as the idea of providence, discussed above. In this connection, however, a brief mention of the Chinese understanding of “impersonal forces” in history seems very much in order. At times, I find it difficult to resist the temptation to interpret what Sima Qian calls “Heaven” in his <i class="calibre9">Records</i> as a vague reference to “impersonal forces,” which may also involve human agency as a collectivity as well. For example, when he referred to the unification of China by the First Emperor of Qin in 221 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> as commanded by Heaven, he may well have had in mind a vague sense of change generated by a historical trend too vast for individuals to stop or resist. For want of an adequate term, he could only resort to the traditional concept of Heaven. In later times, however, a new term, <i class="calibre9">shi</i>, was adopted to explain historical changes involving “impersonal forces.” Speaking of the same event of 221 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> in institutional terms&mdash;the change from the “feudal system” to the “prefectural system,” Liu Zongyuan <span>柳</span><span>宗</span><span>元</span> (773&ndash;819) takes as his explanatory concept, not the old idea of <i class="calibre9">tian</i> <span>天</span>, or Heaven, but the new notion of <i class="calibre9">shi</i> <span>勢</span>, which may be rendered as “condition,” “situation,” “trend,” “tendency,” etc., as the context requires. (This is a different character from the character <i class="calibre9">shi</i> mentioned earlier, meaning “scribe,” “archivist,” or “historiographer.”) According to Liu Zongyuan, the Chinese “feudal system” (<i class="calibre9">fengjian</i> <span>封</span><span>建</span>) did not come into existence purely by human design as tradition says. It was not the case that ancient sages invented this idea and then established it as a political system. Nor was it the case that the First Emperor of Qin arbitrarily abolished it for the convenience of centralization of power. On the contrary, the beginning and end of the system were both necessitated by the “conditions of the times” (<i class="calibre9">shi</i>). Here, Liu clearly perceived what we would call “impersonal forces” in history.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2380" id="calibre_link-2438" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">43</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>After Liu, the term <i class="calibre9">shi</i> became firmly established as a category of historical analysis. Two outstanding examples will suffice to illustrate our point. Wang Fuzhi <span>王</span><span>夫</span><span>之</span> (1619&ndash;1692), particularly, made extensive use of the term in his philosophical discourse on Chinese history. He often appealed to the notion of <i class="calibre9">shi</i> when he tried to give an account of why certain major historical changes had occurred. In a manner very reminiscent of Liu, he also attributed the abolition of the “feudal system” and the emergence of the “prefectural system” under the Qin to the operation of forces generated by the historical “condition of the times” (<i class="calibre9">shi</i>). He even went a step further to raise the question of the possibility that there may have been “principles” (<i class="calibre9">li</i> <span>理</span>) governing impersonal forces of change in history. As one of his formulations says, “Historical conditions (<i class="calibre9">shi</i>) change with the times while principles (<i class="calibre9">li</i>) vary with historical conditions.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2381" id="calibre_link-2439" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">44</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1119" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In his best-known essay, “On the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>,” Zhang Xuecheng also used <i class="calibre9">shi</i> to explain the evolution of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> <span>道</span> (Way) in history. True to the spirit of his age, Zhang historicized the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> to a point dangerously close to the borderline of his Confucian faith. In his conception, as the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> gradually evolved in history, it took forms in human society through all kinds of institutional developments&mdash;political, social, economic, and cultural. It was a process of evolution in the sense that the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> began in the simplest form of the family (“three persons living together in one house”), and then grew more and more complex with the increase of population and the ever-increasing differentiations of social functions. What particularly interests us here, however, is how Zhang brings “impersonal forces” to bear on this evolutionary process. The emergence of many great institutions in pre-Confucian antiquity, the above-discussed “feudal system” among them, marks the earliest breakthrough in the evolution of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. According to the Confucian tradition, these institutions were created by a long line of sage-rulers ending with the Duke of Zhou, for whom Confucius showed unbounded admiration. Like Liu Zongyuan before him, Zhang argues against this traditional Great Men theory, but in a more systematic and sophisticated way. In his view, even with “sagely wisdom” as enormous as that of the Duke of Zhou’s, the Duke could not have accomplished so much had it not been for the fact that he happened to live in the times when all necessary conditions converged to make such institutional creations possible. As aptly expressed by David S. Nivison, “A sage cannot ‘create’ just anything. What he achieves is strictly limited by the possibilities of the historical moment.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2382" id="calibre_link-2440" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">45</a></small></sup> In his discussion of ancient institutions, Zhang invariably attributes their origins to historical situations (<i class="calibre9">shi</i>) that he describes as “inevitable.” But he goes beyond Liu to suggest that these inevitable historical situations or conditions arise, ultimately, from “the daily activities in human relations” (<i class="calibre9">renlun riyong</i> <span>人</span><span>倫</span><span>日</span><span>用</span>) of the unreflective common people, which he identifies as none other than the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> itself. This is why he says that only by “learning from the common people” can the sage seek to know the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2383" id="calibre_link-2441" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">46</a></small></sup> This idea is not exactly new in the Confucian tradition. Nevertheless, Zhang is certainly the first Confucian thinker to apply it to the study of history, thereby making more explicit what he means by “inevitable historical situations.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1314" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>From the middle of the seventeenth century on, Chinese historiography underwent a significant change due partly to the rise of evidential scholarship and partly to external factors that cannot be discussed here. For our purpose here, I wish only to mention three important developments. First, historians moved beyond political history and their research branched out in all directions. Second, they tended to focus their attention on special topics and problems, and began to present their findings in a protomonographic form. I say “protomonographic” because their favorite medium of scholarly communication was the highly condensed “note,” which was capable of being developed into modern monographs or dissertations. As a matter of fact, many twentieth-century Chinese historians have indeed used these “notes” as starting points for their monographic research. The leading authority on Chinese religious history, Chen Yuan <span>陳</span><span>垣</span> (1880&ndash;1971), once made the interesting analogy that an insightful “note” by a Qing scholar may be compared to a spoonful of milk powder, with which boiling water will make a full cup of milk.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2384" id="calibre_link-2442" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">47</a></small></sup> Third, the philological turn during the early Qing made scholars increasingly aware of the historical changes of language. A central concern common to both classicists and historians was to discover the changing meanings of words and terms from the times of Confucius down through the centuries. As a result, scholars’ horizons were broadened, research was specialized, and historical sense was sharpened.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Both Wang’s and Zhang’s ideas about historical changes must be understood in light of these intellectual reorientations. Among practicing historians, there was also a growing interest in the origins, evolution, or changes of particular aspects of Chinese civilization, in realms as diverse as kinship systems, religious rituals and beliefs, philosophical ideas, civil service examinations, poetry, art, music, printing, and foot binding, to give only a few examples. Some (such as Zhao Yi <span>趙</span><span>翼</span>, 1727&ndash;1814) even ventured to offer general observations on patterns of change in longer or shorter historical periods and explore their possible causes. None of us will probably go so far as Liang Qichao and assert that “the Qing scholars’ pursuit of knowledge was based solely on the inductive method and a scientific spirit.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2385" id="calibre_link-2443" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">48</a></small></sup> Nevertheless, it is undeniable that some of the important elements of modern (Western) historical scholarship were beginning to emerge in Qing evidential research. It is probably safe to conclude that on the eve of the coming of the West, Chinese historiography reached its own peak, both conceptually and methodologically.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It cannot be purely accidental that at exactly the same time, in the last years of the eighteenth century, Zhao Yi, in his <i class="calibre9">Nianershi zhaji</i> <span>廿</span><span>二</span><span>史</span><span>劄</span><span>記</span> (Notes on Twenty-two Histories, Shanghai: Shanghai guji, 1995 [1795]), proposed a fundamentally new way of reading Chinese history, while Zhang Xuecheng, in his <i class="calibre9">Wenshi tongyi</i> <span>文</span><span>史</span><span>通</span><span>義</span> (General Principles of Literature and History), developed theories and ideas about history in a systematic fashion. To the best of my judgment, Zhang’s is the only work in the long Chinese intellectual tradition truly worthy of the name “philosophy of history” in its several senses. The significance of Zhao and Zhang in the history of modern historiography is well summed up by E. G. Pulleyblank in his part of the introduction to <i class="calibre9">Historians of China and Japan</i>: in the former “we find a man who could see beyond the isolated details and make the kind of inductive generalizations about trends of social and institutional history that modern historians seek to establish.” On the other hand, the latter propounded “general ideas about the nature and meaning of history which for the first time tried to break out of the traditional mould and approached a conception more like our modern one” (7).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-999" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Even as late as the eighteenth century, however, when Chinese historiography came closer to its counterpart in the West, as shown in the cases of Zhao Yi and Zhang Xuecheng, there is still no evidence that Chinese historians ever conceived of history as a process of linear progress toward some definite end. In other words, no Hegel, Marx, Spengler, or Toynbee can be found in the Chinese tradition. It is true that Liu Zongyuan, Wang Fuzhi, and Zhang Xuecheng all developed the idea that the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> evolved in history. Yet a closer scrutiny shows that none of them conceived of the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> in terms of Hegel’s <i class="calibre9">Geist</i>, which uses “history” to realize its own end. On the contrary, the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> really does nothing and its evolution depends entirely on the work of Man, especially the sages, for all Chinese historians still believed in the fundamental truth first discovered by Confucius that “It is Man who is capable of broadening the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>. It is not the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> that is capable of broadening Man” (<i class="calibre9">Analects</i> 15.29).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As shown above, Chinese historians were not wholly unaware of the operation of “impersonal forces” in history. They also recognized the existence of “historical trends” or “patterns of change” in the past. However, when they ventured generalizations, these generalizations were invariably limited in time and confined to a particular aspect. It never occurred to them that it was their business to establish “universal historical laws” or theorize about the entire process of human history. Deeply influenced by the cosmology of the <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i> <span>易</span><span>經</span> (Classic of Changes), it was one of their “absolute presuppositions” that the historical process would never be complete. Every educated person in traditional China knew that the last hexagram in the <i class="calibre9">Changes</i> is called “Before Completion” (<i class="calibre9">weiji</i> <span>未</span><span>濟</span>): “Things cannot exhaust themselves. Hence there follows, at the end, the hexagram of ‘Before Completion.’ ”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2386" id="calibre_link-2444" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">49</a></small></sup> The idea of “end of history” in both its senses was simply inconceivable to the mind of the traditional Chinese historian. In this connection, Wang Fuzhi, whose historical ideas are primarily based on the cosmology of the <i class="calibre9">Changes</i>, may be called back to the witness stand. As succinctly summed up by Ian McMorran:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>One can only appreciate how a trend in <i class="calibre9">shi</i> (condition) works by a thorough analysis of the various factors which constitute it…. Such a trend, however, is not necessarily irreversible; only change itself is inevitable. With the constant evolution of the universe, conditions are constantly changing, too, but the manner of their change is neither predetermined nor absolutely inevitable. Man must do what he can to influence it.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2387" id="calibre_link-2445" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">50</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Needless to say, what Wang thought about the universe applies with equal validity to history. The central importance of human agency in Chinese historical thought leaves little room for a thoroughgoing determinism of any kind.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1072" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The lack of an impulse to speculate on the whole process of history on the part of Chinese historians makes it rather difficult for us to assert with any degree of definiteness whether Chinese historical thought is linear or cyclical. There is a general tendency among Western scholars to put China on the cyclical side largely because of the great popularity of the idea of “dynastic cycle,” which, as far as I can see, is a highly misleading term. Even in the realm of political history, there has been an unmistakable trend among Confucian scholars since the Song dynasty to make the claim that their own dynasty surpassed the previous ones in certain aspects. Yang Liansheng has proposed to characterize this mentality as “dynastic competition,” which implies “progress” in a limited sense. With regard to material life and social customs, the T’ang institutional historian Du You <span>杜</span><span>佑</span> (735&ndash;812) stated in no uncertain terms that the Chinese had progressed from barbarism in high antiquity to a highly civilized way of life in his own day.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2388" id="calibre_link-2446" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">51</a></small></sup> In philosophy, Huang Zongxi <span>黃</span><span>宗</span><span>羲</span> (1610&ndash;1695) also said that the Ming was by far superior to earlier dynasties.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2389" id="calibre_link-2447" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">52</a></small></sup> Very often, we find the same historians holding a cyclical view on one occasion and the idea of linear development on another, Sima Qian included. In the Chinese case, however, progress does not necessarily imply irreversibility. Nor does the process of evolution presuppose “universal laws” or a specific “end.” In this context, I would like to suggest that the difficulties in applying the distinction between “progress” and “cycle” to Chinese historical thought may extend just as well to all the long-established Western dichotomies such as “the universal versus the particular,” “objectivity versus moral judgment,” “explanation versus interpretation,” or “history versus chronicle.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>From Hegel to modern sinologists, Chinese historiography as a whole has been consistently described, when compared with that of the West, as being mainly concerned with “facts” and lacking “opinion or reasoning” (Hegel) or “the kind of abstract thinking required for reaching a synthesis.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2390" id="calibre_link-2448" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">53</a></small></sup> I choose not to respond directly to this kind of judgment here because it would take a great deal more “reasoning” or “abstract thinking” than I can possibly afford in this context. But I must say it does have some basis in fact and cannot be lightly brushed aside as another Western “prejudice.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1030" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>To bring my reflections to a close, I wish to relate this allegedly negative feature of Chinese historiography to some other points raised in Burke’s paper, such as the West’s preoccupation with epistemology and causal explanation. Yüeh-lin Chin (Jin Yuelin <span>金</span><span>岳</span><span>霖</span>) (1896&ndash;1984), a noted Chinese philosopher thoroughly trained in Western philosophy and logic, made a rough comparison between Chinese and Western philosophy. In his view, “One of the features characteristic of Chinese philosophy is the underdevelopment of what might be called logico-epistemological consciousness.” As a result, there was also a lack of systematic development of science. Moreover, the emphasis in Chinese philosophy on “the unity of Heaven and Man” (“Heaven” here perhaps means more “nature” than “the supernatural”) also prevented the Chinese from developing a Baconian attitude toward the natural world.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2391" id="calibre_link-2449" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">54</a></small></sup> I believe Chin’s characterization of Chinese philosophy applies mutatis mutandis to Chinese historiography<i class="calibre9">.</i> As Burke points out, the early origin of “cause” in Greek historical writing indicates that “the Western ideal of a historiography modeled on the natural sciences is an old one.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2392" id="calibre_link-2450" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">55</a></small></sup> For simplicity, I would take <i class="calibre9">both</i> epistemology and causal explanation as ultimately rooted in what is usually referred to as “theoretical reason” in Western culture. Thus, the so-called lack of reasoning or lack of abstract thinking, quoted above, can be understood as resulting from the underdevelopment of “theoretical or speculative reason” in the Chinese tradition. I emphasize the word “underdevelopment” advisedly, for underdevelopment is not the same as total absence. If we look at Chinese philosophy, especially Neo-Confucian philosophy, instead of Chinese historiography, we can also find a great deal of abstract reasoning even though it still pales before its Western counterpart. According to my own reading, traditional Chinese historians were equally concerned with why a particular event of some historical significance happened as it did. Sima Qian’s inclusion of Jia Yi’s essay, “Guo Qin lun” <span>過</span><span>秦</span><span>論</span> (The Faults of Qin) at the end of the “Basic Annals of the First Emperor of Qin” (<i class="calibre9">Qin Shihuang benji</i>) is but one example showing that the Grand Historian was looking for the “causes” of the fall of the Qin Empire.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>By and large, however, no systematic attempt was made to theorize about “ultimate causes” or search for “general laws” in history as such. In contrast to Western theorists of history, nor was the Chinese historian disposed to develop a systematic theory out of an important historical observation, due perhaps to his rather underdeveloped “theoretical reason.” For example, the importance of the economic basis to moral consciousness and social order had long been emphasized by Chinese historians, as clearly shown in Ban Gu’s “Shihuo zhi” <span>食</span><span>貨</span><span>志</span> (Treatise on Food and Money) in the <i class="calibre9">Hanshu</i> <span>漢</span><span>書</span> (History of the Former Han Dynasty).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2393" id="calibre_link-2451" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">56</a></small></sup> Nevertheless, a theoretical development along the lines of <i class="calibre9">The German Ideology</i> (1846) by Marx and Engels was not even dreamed of. Perhaps there is some truth in Karl Mannheim’s suggestion that “in Germany there has always existed a tendency to go to extremes in pushing logical arguments to their ultimate conclusions.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2394" id="calibre_link-2452" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">57</a></small></sup> As far as I can see, this seems to be a general feature characteristic of Western thought not unrelated to its fully developed “theoretical reason.” But the development of “theoretical reason” in historiography has its own high cost as well. It tends not only to proliferate one theory after another, but also, at times, to be pushed by its own inner logic to attempt to create a grand system of this or that kind with pretension to universal validity.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Chinese historians in the twentieth century have been primarily captives of Western grand theories. The time has indeed come for them to be liberated from this century-long captivity. There can be no question that “theoretical reason” deserves to be developed in Chinese historiography, not to try another grand theory, but to reach meaningful synthesis&mdash;in whatever manageable research topics&mdash;without doing injustice to the nature of the source material, which necessarily varies from case to case. The noted Russian historian Aaron I. Gurevich, very recently freed from the straitjacket of what he calls “historiography” (which is, of course, of Western origin), has this message to offer:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2493" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It seems to me that all these considerations imply the necessity of elaborating an epistemology specific to history. In contrast to historiography, which is now discredited, the specific epistemology of history suggested here need not create a single universally-applicable framework. Instead of a single system applied from without to the infinitely varied materials of history, we suggest an ad hoc hermeneutical method that will develop within the process of research itself. This method should be based both on the particular historical sources being studied and the analytic methods being used.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-2395" id="calibre_link-2453" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">58</a></small></sup></span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1016" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">C</span>hronological biography (<i class="calibre9">nianpu</i>) is a special form of Chinese historical writing. Leaving aside the lost <i class="calibre9">Zibian nianpu</i> <span>自</span><span>編</span><span>年</span><span>譜</span> (Autobiographical Compilation) of Bai Juyi <span>白</span><span>居</span><span>易</span> (772&ndash;864), this form of writing can be traced to the Song dynasty (960&ndash;1279) beginning with the chronological biographies of Han Yu <span>韓</span><span>愈</span> (768&ndash;824) and Liu Zongyuan <span>柳</span><span>宗</span><span>元</span> (773&ndash;819). In the one thousand years since, thousands of <i class="calibre9">nianpu</i>, including chronological autobiographies, have been produced in China. More than twelve hundred chronological biographies are listed in Li Shitao’s <i class="calibre9">Zhongguo lidai mingren nianpu mulu</i> (Bibliography of Chronological Biographies of Famous Figures by Dynasty).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-507" id="calibre_link-543" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> Today, new chronological biographies are published almost every year in both mainland China and Taiwan. Clearly, chronological biography is still full of vitality in Chinese historiography.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1158" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Although it originated much earlier, chronological biography flourished during the Qing dynasty (1644&ndash;1911). Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1871&ndash;1929) points out that “Qing Confucian scholars were so excellent at the writing of chronological biography that they outdistanced such writings from earlier times.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-508" id="calibre_link-544" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> Liang’s judgment is well grounded. The Evidential Research Movement of the Qing dynasty expanded the Chinese conception of history. As a result, chronological biography gradually assumed an independent existence instead of remaining just an appendix to collected works, and became an integral component of Chinese historiography. Zhang Xuecheng <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span> (1738&ndash;1801) discusses the characteristics of chronological biography in the postscript to “Han Liu er xiansheng nianpu” <span>韓</span><span>柳</span><span>二</span><span>先</span><span>生</span><span>年</span><span>譜</span> (Chronological Biographies of Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan) in his <i class="calibre9">Wenshi tongyi</i> (General Principles of Literature and History). He argues:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The form of chronological biography began in the Song Period, when scholars took the opportunity to edit previous writings to chronologize their authors’ time and lives so that we may understand why they said things as they actually did. This is what is called the learning of knowing people against their times. Although a literary collection is only the history of one person, it nevertheless provides evidence for the history of a family, a state, or a dynasty. So it must be done with great care.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-509" id="calibre_link-545" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>He further states:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Compilation of the chronological biography of the literary writer did not occur until the Song dynasty. It has proven quite useful not only to the study of a writer’s collected works in particular, but also generally helpful to our understanding of past writers against the times in which they lived and wrote. Writings are done for the purpose of establishing one’s ideas. However, different ideas were expressed in different times, and even the same idea will be greatly different in meaning because of time differences…. Earlier generations did not understand the meaning of using literary writings as history, so the methods were not perfected. Therefore, we must await profound scholars to explore and discuss the methods with their best efforts. Only then are we able to understand a person’s life from the beginning to the end.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-510" id="calibre_link-546" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>What merits attention here is Zhang Xuecheng’s emphasis on the concept of time. This means that we should not only know who said what, but also make clear when and under what circumstances those words were written. This new point of view arose from a highly developed historical sense. Scholars before Zhang Xuecheng obviously possessed this concept to a certain degree, but it was not manifested in a clearly defined form, at least not on the fully conscious level as was Zhang Xuecheng’s. As a result, the rise of chronological biography shows that Chinese historiography from the Song to Qing was becoming progressively more mature.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1020" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Since 1911, the writing of chronological biography has developed even further. <i class="calibre9">Yuxisheng nianpu huijian</i> (A Chronological Biography of Li Shangyin; 1963) by Zhang Caitian and <i class="calibre9">Zhang Shizhai nianpu</i> (A Chronological Biography of Zhang Xuecheng; 1922) by Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962) are both famous works. Following the style of Zhu Heling <span>朱</span><span>鶴</span><span>齡</span> (1606&ndash;1683) and Feng Hao <span>馮</span><span>浩</span> (1719&ndash;1801) of the Qing dynasty, Zhang’s work can be regarded as bringing Qing biographical writing to its methodological perfection. What was original in Zhang’s judging of Li Shangying’s subjective intentions against chronological objectivity was his application of the method of “carefully examining the poet’s life year by year, and probing his inner world with great depth.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-511" id="calibre_link-547" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup> This was a “breakthrough” in terms of the writing of chronological biography.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-512" id="calibre_link-548" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In style and form, Hu Shi’s work broke new ground. He believes that “the chronological biography is a major evolution of Chinese biographical writing.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-513" id="calibre_link-549" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> He also applied chronological biography to the study of intellectual history. Liang Qichao commented quite justly that Hu’s work “not only outlined the academic accomplishments of the subject but also summarized the trends of the time.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-514" id="calibre_link-550" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> Therefore, the impact of Hu’s work became more extensive than that of Zhang’s. Later, the emergence in China of many chronological biographies of scholars and thinkers was, by and large, encouraged by the success of Hu’s work.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Nevertheless, Hu Shi holds that China’s biographical literature was less developed than that of Europe. In 1914, he summarized the differences between biographical writings produced in China and the West, “biographies of our country depict only the character of a person, while biographical writing in the West not only depicts a person’s character but also his character development.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-515" id="calibre_link-551" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In 1932, he wrote in <i class="calibre9">Lingxiu rencai de laiyuan</i> <span>領</span><span>袖</span><span>人</span><span>才</span><span>的</span><span>來</span><span>源</span> (The Sources of Leadership):</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The development of European biographical literature was most complete. Important figures of history were the subject of detailed biographies. One biography was often as long as several hundred thousand words in length, and there were also cases when scores of biographies were written about a single person…. Biographical writing in China was underdeveloped. As a result, Chinese historical figures were usually made known through inscriptions on stelae or biographical entries in official histories. As historical sources, most Chinese biographies were unreliable and the readable ones were very few. There were absolutely no inspiring and soul-stirring biographies in China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-516" id="calibre_link-552" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>The few lively and readable biographies and autobiographies identified by Hu Shi included such works as <i class="calibre9">Zhuzi nianpu</i> <span>朱</span><span>子</span><span>年</span><span>譜</span> (A Chronological Biography of Zhu Xi) by Wang Maohong <span>王</span><span>懋</span><span>竑</span> (1668&ndash;1741), <i class="calibre9">Yangming nianpu</i> <span>陽</span><span>明</span><span>年</span><span>譜</span> (A Chronological Biography of Wang Yangming) by Qian Dehong <span>錢</span><span>德</span><span>洪</span> (1496&ndash;1574), and <i class="calibre9">Bingta menghen lu</i> <span>病</span><span>榻</span><span>夢</span><span>痕</span><span>録</span> (Record of Dreams on a Sickbed: A Self-Edited Chronological Biography) by Wang Huizu <span>汪</span><span>輝</span><span>祖</span> (1730&ndash;1807). Generally speaking, this overall impression of Hu’s is well grounded.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1237" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Sinologists in the West more or less share the same view. For example, in one of his articles on China’s biographical writing, Denis Twitchett maintains that although there is a wealth of Chinese biographical data, they are almost all stereotyped into an epitaph-memorial and seldom reveal a subject’s personality. Twitchett notes that a reader would be disappointed if he read Chinese biographies by the standards of Western biography. Like Hu Shi, Twitchett appreciates the style of chronological biography that had developed since the Song dynasty. He believes that this style of writing not only provides accurate dates but also meets the Western demand to emphasize “the life and the times” of the subject. However, he also faults the style of chronological biography. To him, the advantage of chronological biography is its accuracy in dates, but the disadvantage is that it could not provide a connected narrative of events in the style of Western biographies. He concludes, “The <i class="calibre9">nien-p</i>’<i class="calibre9">u</i> [nianpu] is not so much a biography as a collection of notes for a biography.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-517" id="calibre_link-553" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Twitchett’s critique is valid with respect to most Chinese chronological biography. However, his assertion that because Chinese chronological biographies could not present a “continuous narration,” they are not so much biographies as they are collections of notes for biographies, raises a serious question. If we exclude <i class="calibre9">nianpu</i> from the field of biographical writing, China would have an even poorer collection of biographical literature. In this connection, it is necessary to explain the similarities and differences between the Chinese and Western traditions of biographical writing.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Biographical writing in the West indeed has a long tradition. <i class="calibre9">Geschichte der Autobiographie</i> (History of Autobiography), written by Georg Misch (1878&ndash;1965) of Germany, is generally acknowledged as the most authoritative work in the field. Misch began to work on this book in 1904. By 1965, when he died, he had only reached as far as Alighieri Dante (1265&ndash;1321). By then, there were already four thousand pages in the four volumes published in eight parts. The extraordinary richness of data in antiquity, as reflected in this book, does not mean that autobiographical writing had long ago developed as a tradition because Westerners had a consciousness of “self” in the very beginning of their history. As a matter of fact, there were few Western works in the classical period that could be called autobiographies by modern standards. Information on autobiographies dating before the fourth century <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>, collected by Misch, comes mostly from poems that accidentally reveal the background of the subject. Some specialists in ancient Greek biographical literature even suggest that the Greek practice of self-narration had been adopted from ancient Persia or from somewhere else in the Orient.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-518" id="calibre_link-554" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup> Until the medieval period (500&ndash;1400), independent and comprehensive autobiographies were very limited in number&mdash;probably no more than ten.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-519" id="calibre_link-555" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> Strictly speaking, the practice of biographical writing (including autobiography) in the West started in the eighteenth century. Hu Shi’s view of a highly developed biographical literature in Europe most likely refers to the works of the modern age.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-985" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Prior to modern times, Chinese biographical writing does not seem to have been inferior to its European counterpart. The following works were definitely autobiographies: “Zixu” <span>自</span><span>序</span>(Dual Biography) and “Bao Ren-an shu” <span>報</span><span>任</span><span>安</span><span>書</span> (In Response to Ren-an) by Sima Qian <span>司</span><span>馬</span><span>遷</span> (145&ndash;86 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>), “Xuzhuan” <span>敘</span><span>傳</span> (Genealogical Sketch) by Ban Gu <span>班</span><span>固</span> (32&ndash;92), “Ziji pian” <span>自</span><span>紀</span><span>篇</span> (Self-Sketch) by Wang Chong <span>王</span><span>充</span> (27&ndash;97), <i class="calibre9">Zixu</i> <span>自</span><span>敘</span> (Autobiography) by Ge Hong <span>葛</span><span>洪</span> (284&ndash;364), and <i class="calibre9">Zixu</i> <span>自</span><span>敘</span> (Autobiography) by Liu Zhiji <span>劉</span><span>知</span><span>幾</span> (661&ndash;721). Autobiographical writing in China not only originated earlier than in the West, where <i class="calibre9">Confessions</i> by St. Augustine (354&ndash;430) is generally regarded as the earliest form of autobiographical writing, but also had developed a tradition, as Yu Xin <span>庾</span><span>信</span> (513&ndash;581) points out in his rhapsody “Ai Jiangnan fu” (Lament for the South): “In the past, Huan Tan’s career and Du Yu’s life story were both described in the autobiographical accounts appended to their scholarly works. In Pan Yue’s essays, he began with recounting the family tradition (<i class="calibre9">jiafeng</i> <span>家</span><span>風</span>), and also in Lu Ji’s rhapsodies, he began with recounting the ancestral virtues (<i class="calibre9">shide</i> <span>世</span><span>德</span>).”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-520" id="calibre_link-556" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> Some would argue that Chinese autobiographical writing emphasized “family tradition” and “ancestral virtues,” but not the subject himself. In fact, the same phenomena occurred in early European autobiographical writing. In ancient Greece and Rome, since the upper classes were linked by kinship, family status and family genealogy were matters of serious concern. The heroes of Homer’s <i class="calibre9">Iliad</i> and <i class="calibre9">Odyssey</i> claimed to be sons of famous families. The Romans also prided themselves on their “ancestral virtues.” In societies such as ancient Greece or Rome, autobiographical sources were embodied in poetry and prose, which hardly gave priority to the subject’s character. St. Augustine’s <i class="calibre9">Confessions</i> perhaps comes nearest to modern autobiography; however, there is still controversy among specialists over the nature of the work, that is, whether or not it should be regarded as an autobiography. In the <i class="calibre9">Confessions</i>, St. Augustine devoted half of the book to an account of his past, and yet this part did not address his main purpose: to articulate a Christian worldview. Therefore, in respect to autobiography, <i class="calibre9">Confessions</i> has an inherent limitation.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-521" id="calibre_link-557" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Classical Western autobiography faced the same situation as did biographical writing. The limitations of biography and tablet inscriptions in China are also found in Western works. The <i class="calibre9">Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</i> by Diogenes Laetius (c. 412&ndash;328 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>) is an important source for the study of the history of ancient philosophy. However, it contains many careless mistakes, contradictions, and some unbelievable descriptions.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-522" id="calibre_link-558" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup> Moreover, numerous epitaphs from Roman gravestones have survived to modern times, the writing of which, in most cases, followed almost the same pattern, and seldom, if ever, reflected the achievements and ideas of the dead.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-523" id="calibre_link-559" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> As Peter Brown points out:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1182" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In so many ancient and medieval biographies, for instance, we meet heroes described in terms of their essentials, ideal qualities. It is almost as if they had no past: even their childhood is described only in terms of omens of the future “peak” of their life&mdash;St. Ambrose plays at being a bishop, St. Cuthbert refused to turn cartwheels. We meet them full face: it is as if they had sloughed off, in their past, all that did not point directly to the image of perfection to which they conformed.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-524" id="calibre_link-560" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Brown’s passage will immediately remind those who are familiar with Chinese traditional biographical literature of the stories about “prodigies.” It is thus clear that before modern times, differences between Chinese and Western biographical writing were not as great as once imagined. There are, of course, differences, but they are only cultural differences. It is clearly an overstatement to say that Western biography was lively and reliable from its very beginnings, while Chinese biography was always stereotyped and unreliable. Western biographical writings since the eighteenth century have been truly lively and detailed, but not necessarily always reliable. For example, the tale had been told for over one hundred years that George Washington (1732&ndash;1799), the first president of the United States, when he was a child, cut his father’s cherry tree with a hatchet and admitted it afterward without any hesitation. This tale first appeared in Mason L. Weems’ <i class="calibre9">The Life of Washington</i> published in 1806. But it has since been discovered that the story was invented.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-525" id="calibre_link-561" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It was mentioned previously that chronological biography is a relatively new form of biographical writing in traditional Chinese historiography. This was the result of efforts by Song scholars who used chronicles as the vehicle for writing the “history of one person.” Therefore, the appearance of chronological biography can be regarded as a breakthrough in Chinese historiography. Zhang Xuecheng’s point is well taken when he emphasized that chronological biography “can enhance our understanding of a person’s character as well as his world” (<i class="calibre9">youbuyu zhi ren lun shi zhi xue</i> <span>有</span><span>補</span><span>於</span><span>知</span><span>人</span><span>論</span><span>世</span><span>之</span><span>學</span>).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>This development in Chinese historiography cannot be seen easily from the viewpoint of modern Western historiography. This is because the understanding of “chronicle” is quite different in China than in the West. In China, forms of historical writing included both biography and chronicle. Neither of these two forms could be ignored, though each of them had its advantages and disadvantages. This became generally settled ever since <i class="calibre9">Zizhi tongjian</i> <span>資</span><span>治</span><span>通</span><span>鑑</span> (The Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government) by Sima Guang <span>司</span><span>馬</span><span>光</span> (1019&ndash;1086) of the Song dynasty, developed the “chronicle” as a form of historical writing to a new height. This work not only maintained the strong points of ancient chronicles, i.e., “recording events in every possible way” (<i class="calibre9">bei zai qi shi</i> <span>備</span><span>載</span><span>其</span><span>事</span>) and “avoiding unnecessary repetition in wording” (<i class="calibre9">yu wu chong chu</i> <span>語</span><span>無</span><span>重</span><span>出</span>), but also avoided their shortcomings, namely, “leaving out nothing and failing to see the whole picture” (<i class="calibre9">lun qi xi ye, ze jie wu yi; yu qi cu ye, ze qiu shan shi qi</i> <span>論</span><span>其</span><span>細</span><span>也</span>, <span>則</span><span>則</span><span>介</span><span>無</span><span>遺</span>; <span>言</span><span>其</span><span>粗</span><span>也</span>, <span>則</span><span>丘</span><span>山</span><span>是</span><span>棄</span>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-526" id="calibre_link-562" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> As a result, when we read <i class="calibre9">The Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government</i>, we do not feel that it fails to narrate events continuously or to explain their cause and effect.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1008" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The West has taken another approach toward the chronicle. The theory and method of modern Western historiography was basically established in the eighteenth century. Before that, the chronicle reflected the orthodox school of historiography belonging to the medieval period. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, British scientists such as Sir Isaac Newton (1642&ndash;1726), philosophers such as John Locke (1632&ndash;1704), and men of letters such as Samuel Johnson (1709&ndash;1784) all regarded the medieval chronicles as classics indispensable for the education of the upper classes.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In addition to chronicles, “annals” constituted another branch of Western historical writing. The “annals” originated in British monasteries of the sixth century. Abbots in monasteries created calendars every year. Later, they kept records of major events on the calendar, which thus became a tradition. This practice passed from British to European monasteries in the seventh century, and subsequently, annals were produced in all Western European monasteries. Those annals today are still important sources for the study of medieval history. Differences between chronicles and monastery annals are generally held to be that the former are universal history, and the latter, regional history. In the late nineteenth century, some scholars still regarded the chronicle as integral history, since it reflected the whole course of an event from beginning to end in uniform style, while the annals consisted of nothing but data for the use of historians, somewhat similar to China’s imperial gazettes.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-527" id="calibre_link-563" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>However, in the modern Western conception of history, the chronicle as a form of historical writing has been generally repudiated. Benedetto Croce (1866&ndash;1952) was perhaps the most severe critic of chronicles. He thought that there was neither spirit nor life in the empty body of a chronicle, for it lacked an inner understanding of a historical event. He argued that “history is a living chronicle, a chronicle is dead history.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-528" id="calibre_link-564" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> Croce’s remark was obviously critical, but a bit too abstract, and rather difficult to grasp.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>James Johnson more recently analyzed the differences between chronicle and historiography by raising three arguments. He notes first that modern historiography gave priority to human affairs, while in the so-called universe of the chronicle, first place was given to nature or even the supernatural. The reason for this was that Western historiography was influenced by astrology in ancient times, and then in medieval times it was overshadowed by the theory of “God’s will.” Thus, the so-called universe in the chronicle actually included much that was “cosmic.” His second criticism of the chronicle holds that whereas modern historiography took cause and effect as its central issue, the chronicle explained the changes in human affairs in terms of God’s will, a case in which events in the human world are but epiphenomenal to cosmic events. Finally, Johnson argues that because the chronicle neglected cause and effect in human terms and emphasized the influence of the cosmos, it did not consider the truth or falseness of historical facts, but focused instead on the temporal sequence in which historical events happened. In Johnson’s estimation, the chronicle was merely a chronological table and review; creating a continuous narrative, on the contrary, was no longer a task for the chroniclers to assume.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-529" id="calibre_link-565" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1156" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Criticism of traditional Western chronicles by modern Western historians helps explain why sinologists have difficulty in appreciating the Chinese style of the chronicle (including chronological biography). The previously cited criticism by Denis Twitchett that China’s chronicles lacked continuous narration reflects his different cultural heritage. Even E. G. Pulleyblank, who admired Sima Guang’s achievements in historical writing, criticized Sima Guang for adopting the annalistic (<i class="calibre9">biannian</i> <span>編</span><span>年</span>) form in composing his <i class="calibre9">Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government</i>. He states: “The annalistic (<i class="calibre9">pien-nien</i> [<i class="calibre9">biannian</i>]) form which he adopted for history was not new and might even be thought retrograde in comparison to the topical arrangement of the Standard Histories&mdash;basic annals, monographs, tables, biographies.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-530" id="calibre_link-566" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> As for myself, I do not think that the annalist form could have remained the main form of Chinese historiography; neither do I agree with the argument that the annalist form has completely lost its value as a result of the impact of modern historiography. For example, a book by Karl Ploetz (1819&ndash;1881), a famous nineteenth-century German historian, entitled <i class="calibre9">An Epitome of Ancient, Medieval, and Modern History</i> (English translation published in 1883), was a very successful example of the chronicle form of historical writing. After the publication of the original German edition and the English translation, this book enjoyed great popularity and has been reprinted many times. Later, in 1940, William L. Langer (1896&ndash;1977), a professor of modern European history at Harvard University, edited <i class="calibre9">An Encyclopedia of World History</i>. This is also in the chronicle form, and has been revised and reprinted many times as well. Almost everybody engaged in the study of history in the United States has a copy of this book. This shows that historical works in the annalist form are still in great demand and that the annalist form has its modern usage. In China, Guo Tingyi’s <span>郭</span><span>廷</span><span>以</span> (1903&ndash;1975) <i class="calibre9">Taiping tianguo shishi rizhi</i> (Chronicle of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom) and <i class="calibre9">Zhonghua minguo shishi rizhi</i> (Chronicle of the Republic of China) are also useful reference works.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-531" id="calibre_link-567" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Although the Chinese annalist form has not been adopted in Western historical writing, I have found that in their works, Western scholars occasionally write special chapters on the life and thought of famous characters along chronological lines. For example, the first chapter of J. P. Stern’s <i class="calibre9">A Study of Nietzsche</i> (published by Cambridge University Press in 1979) is entitled “A Chronology of Nietzsche’s Life.” Chronologies of this kind clearly help readers to get to “know historical characters and to understand the world in which they live” (<i class="calibre9">zhi ren lun shi</i> <span>知</span><span>人</span><span>論</span><span>世</span>).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1069" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As far as the mainstream of modern Western biographical writing is concerned, however, the concept of the chronicle is not accepted by many Western biographers. This is especially the case in life-history studies, which became popular after the rise of psychohistory, and are largely incompatible with the chronicle form of writing. Psychohistory has so far mainly taken the form of biography. Typical examples are <i class="calibre9">Leonardo da Vinci: A Memory of His Childhood</i> (1910) by Sigmund Freud and <i class="calibre9">Thomas Woodrow Wilson</i> (1967), by Sigmund Freud and William C. Bullit. This new practice has not yet been applied in the field of Chinese history, but probably quite a number of historians in both China and the West are ready to try. Once psychohistory becomes common in Chinese biographical writing, our evaluation of chronicles will surely change. I would like to take this opportunity to express some of my own opinions on this project.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>I am willing to see people trained in psychohistory study Chinese historical figures, but I do not believe that new biographies following psychohistorical perspectives can completely replace the role of chronological biography. In addition, I think that the development of chronological writing will help the study of psychohistory.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-532" id="calibre_link-568" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> As an example of how chronological biography can provide some important clues for psychohistorians, I presume that Zhang Xuecheng had possibly experienced an identity crisis in his early years, based on Zhang Xuecheng’s own account of his sixteenth through twenty-eighth years contained in Hu Shi’s <i class="calibre9">A Chronological Biography of Zhang Xuecheng</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1289" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The reason that Western-style psychohistorical biography has not become accepted in chronicle-style writing is because the former arose against a specific cultural background. Ancient Jews believed that the focal point of historical time was <i class="calibre9">kairos</i>, meaning “decisive moment” or “crucial time,” instead of <i class="calibre9">chromos</i>, meaning “chronological time.” The “crucial time” was a major event that took place in the early history of a nation. A crucial event is thought to have a decisive influence on the character of a nation. As a result, it was forever kept in the memory of that nation. Although the event occurred long ago, the freshness is still felt. This is called “contemporaneity.” Sigmund Freud advanced a bold and enlightening view in his famous work <i class="calibre9">Moses and Monotheism</i>, written in his later years and first published in 1939. Based on some ancient legends, he repudiated the account of Moses in the Old Testament and came to the conclusion that Moses was originally an Egyptian. According to Freud, after Moses led the Jews out of Egypt, they killed him. The Jews became remorseful after killing Moses. This event became the “crucial moment” in the national history of the Jews. Hence, a unique religious sentiment was developed from a deep sense of guilt. The national character of the Jews was thus firmly formed, including a strong sense of morality and an indomitable spirit. The later death of Jesus, according to Freud, was a repeat of the death of Moses. Freud’s interpretation touched off many controversies. It raised many problems, especially when considered from the viewpoint of historical evidence. In view of these problems, one commentator said, “this ingenious structure will appear as but a magnificent castle in the air.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-533" id="calibre_link-569" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup> Freud once hoped that archaeological discoveries would help verify his hypothesis. Unfortunately, nothing has been discovered yet to support it.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-534" id="calibre_link-570" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> Whether Freud’s hypothesis is correct or not, his point about the importance of the “critical moment” in the minds of ancient Israelites is nevertheless valid. Therefore, some psychologists do recognize the profound significance of Freud’s hypothesis, despite its lack of empirical evidence. I am tempted to think that this unique Hebrew concept of time may have served as the cultural background for Freud’s breakthrough in psychoanalysis, especially the theory that early childhood (from birth to five years old) is the “crucial moment” in one’s life.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-535" id="calibre_link-571" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If Freud’s psychoanalysis is understood against this particular cultural origin and background, then we can treat it only as a hypothesis to be verified, not as a universal scientific truth.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-536" id="calibre_link-572" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> As a matter of fact, if we take the period before five years old as the “crucial moment” in a person’s life, it would be very difficult to apply psychoanalysis to the study of historical figures because the psychological experience of their childhood is not adequately documented.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-537" id="calibre_link-573" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup> Therefore, in practice, psychohistorians often find it necessary to revise Freud’s theory. In <i class="calibre9">Young Man Luther</i>, Erikson examined Luther’s period of spiritual struggle from his teenage years until his thirties.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-538" id="calibre_link-574" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> This is comparable to Confucius’s recounting a similar stage in his life as follows: “At fifteen I set my heart upon learning (<i class="calibre9">shiwu er you zhi yu xue</i> <span>十</span><span>五</span><span>而</span><span>有</span><span>志</span><span>於</span><span>學</span>). At thirty, I had planted my feet firmly on the ground (<i class="calibre9">sanshi er li</i> <span>三</span><span>十</span><span>而</span><span>立</span>).”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-539" id="calibre_link-575" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>From the standpoint of historians, we cannot simplify a historical character’s life by focusing solely on his childhood and youth. Moreover, we cannot reduce the level of consciousness to the level of unconsciousness. It should be the task of psychohistorians to explain the connections between different periods of a character’s life, before and after the “crucial moment,” and the inner relation between the conscious and the unconscious. After turning thirty, Confucius experienced further character development. He is reported as saying: “At forty, I no longer suffered from perplexities. At fifty, I knew what was the bidding of Heaven.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-540" id="calibre_link-576" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup> Such changes, experienced late in life, cannot be ignored by psychohistorians who write biographies. Even if we do not subscribe to the Chinese saying “final judgment comes with nailing down the lid of the coffin” (<i class="calibre9">gaiguan dinglun</i> <span>蓋</span><span>棺</span><span>定</span><span>論</span>), at least we should give serious consideration to Confucius’s statement that “a man can reach the age of forty or fifty years and still not be famous” (<i class="calibre9">sishi wushi er wu wen yan</i> <span>四</span><span>十</span><span>五</span><span>十</span><span>而</span><span>無</span><span>聞</span><span>焉</span>).<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-541" id="calibre_link-577" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup> Since Erikson’s work was able to expand psychoanalysis beyond his character’s childhood, there will most likely be future historians continuing to expand the applicability in biographical studies.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1293" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In this light, the “crucial moment” approach stressed by Western psychohistorians is certainly not the only approach to biographical writing. More specifically, to discover the unconscious in a historical character’s psychological makeup undoubtedly contributes to a better understanding, but there are other ways of “knowing a person.” Surprisingly, Freud himself admitted that “for practical purposes in judging human character, a man’s actions and conscious expressions of thought are in most cases sufficient.” This is what historians usually take as their position.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-542" id="calibre_link-578" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup> Freud’s words actually confirm the value of biographical writing in general. In the study of historical figures where psychoanalysis is used, at least two internal restraints can be found. First, the restraint of data: few historical figures leave behind psychological data. Second, the restraint of theory: the hypothesis of the “crucial moment” is likely to drive researchers to concentrate their studies exclusively on their subjects’ early psychological experiences, with the inevitable result of neglecting the “career” and “life” that follow these early experiences. I asserted previously that the study of biography through psychoanalysis needs to be developed in China. Because of the restrictions inherent in this approach, however, it cannot be expected to displace other styles of biography, including chronological biography.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Having first been baptized by the Evidential Research Movement during the Qing dynasty, and then challenged by modern Western historiography, the writing of chronological biography in China has already matured to a remarkable degree. This is indicated by the fact that chronological biography can present “continuous narration” (<i class="calibre9">lianguan xushi</i> <span>連</span><span>貫</span><span>敘</span><span>事</span>) perfectly. As an old saying goes: “Although the Zhou is an old state, its mandate is new.” We have good reason to believe that in the field of Chinese historiography, chronological biography will continue to display its considerable vitality.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1328" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">H</span>istory has always been the most glorious of all branches of knowledge in the scholarly tradition of China. It has declined markedly nowadays, however. This decline is not an isolated or unusual phenomenon; it is merely a part of the poverty of the Chinese scholarly world in modern times. Not only natural sciences, but social sciences and the humanities have not had adequate opportunities for development during the last fifty or sixty years. Even in philosophy, a subject that has the most to do with raising the intellectual level of the average educated person, research and instruction have not gone much beyond the rudimentary stage. History is a knowledge of a synthetic and comprehensive nature and must constantly absorb all kinds of sustenance from other disciplines to flourish. It is no wonder that Chinese historiography has withered under these circumstances. Nonetheless, it still stands out in achievement among all the scholarly disciplines in modern China, if only because it has a long and rich tradition to fall back on.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1256" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The development of modern Chinese historiography has seen the emergence at one time or another of a number of schools, of which two have been particularly influential. The first may be called “the school of historical data,” whose work consists mainly of the collection, analysis, collation, and criticism of the source materials of history. The second one may be called “the school of historical interpretation,” which takes as its central task a systematic interpretation of the entire course of Chinese history. In theory, these two schools have each identified themselves with an essential element of modern historical scholarship: the search for historical data lays the foundation of historical study, while interpretation constitutes its superstructure. Without foundation, one cannot begin any historical study, but without a structure, historical study will remain incomplete. As such, historical data and historical interpretation are complementary endeavors: together, they reinforce each other, separated, they work to each other’s detriment. In practice, however, it has been most unfortunate that these two schools have been polarized to the point of mutual exclusion. As a result, the “Data school” accuses the “Interpretation school” of engaging in building castles in the air, whereas the latter mocks the former as seeing only the trees and not the forest.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>This is not the place to pass judgment on the rights and wrongs of these schools. It is necessary, however, to call attention to some of the unfortunate consequences that continue to flow from their work. An investigation of them is meaningful because it may serve as a useful guide to the future development of Chinese historiography.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">OBJECTIVITY AND SUBJECTIVITY IN HISTORICAL STUDIES</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>The Data school is most strikingly characterized by its total indifference to its own times. Owing largely to their limited understanding of the issue of “objectivity,” historians of this school assume that all facts available to us are one hundred percent objective, capable of revealing to us their authenticity if scientific criticism is applied. Once all facts are investigated, then the “ultimate history” will emerge by itself. Based on this assumption, they deny that historical studies are in any way relevant to the times of the historian. They are committed to the belief that the subjective elements derived from the times in which a historian finds himself will eventually be eliminated, since purely objective facts can be established by strictly following a kind of scientific procedure of evidential investigation.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1163" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>We admit that the truth or falsity of some of the concrete conclusions arrived at by way of evidential investigation are not likely to be affected by time. For example, identification of objects, institutions, and geography in antiquity, dating of historical events and personages, and philological explication of a text are all concrete studies. Conclusions about them, once established, do not usually change with the change of time. Investigations of these topics are only related to what historians regard as “basic facts,” however, and are not to be treated as pertinent to “historical facts.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1772" id="calibre_link-1796" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> Basic facts provide only a framework to historical studies; they do not carry any intrinsic significance, and cannot account for historical changes. Moreover, even investigations of this nature cannot completely escape the influence of the historian’s own times. We might legitimately ask: Why did historians of a particular time become interested in investigating particular sorts of objects, institutions, documents, people, or geographies in history?</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Historians of the Data school not only mistake all basic facts for historical facts; they are also prone to treat individual facts in vacuo. They stress the importance of “criticism,” at the expense of “explanation.” Belief in the doctrine of “history as the study of historical data” has led them to confine “criticism” to the mere determination of the authenticity of source materials. Real historical investigation is impossible under such circumstances. Recent progress in historical knowledge has shown that a historical fact appears to us as such because that is the way historians understand it. Historical facts with which a historian must initially deal in order to carry out a research project are always innumerable. After careful examination and repeated scrutiny, however, he will be able to distinguish among them those that are relevant from those that are not relevant to the particular historical phenomenon he is investigating. Moreover, he will also be able to establish the complicated hierarchical relationships among a multitude of relevant facts. Recognition of these hierarchical relations constitutes a par excellence explanation of a historical phenomenon. It is in this sense that the <i class="calibre9">Shujing</i> <span>書</span><span>經</span> (Classic of History) has been defined as “to interpret so as to know the past,” and the purpose of the <i class="calibre9">Shiji</i> <span>史</span><span>記</span> (Records of the Grand Historian) is described by Sima Qian <span>司</span><span>馬</span><span>遷</span> (ca. 145 or 135&ndash;86 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>) himself as “to comprehend the changes of the past and present.” Therefore, while we are sympathetic to the emphasis the Data school places on critical examination of evidence, we do not take this as the be-all and end-all of historical studies. A modern-day historian must, on the one hand, establish the authenticity of facts by employing the most rigorous critical methods and, on the other, utilize both the new achievements in various related disciplines and his own fresh point of view derived from time to illuminate the relations among various historical facts.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1031" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Historians often differ in their approaches to history. They may offer different explanations of the same historical change according to their various conceptions of the historical facts and their interrelationships. A consensus is hard to achieve. It is especially true that historical interpretations change with the changes of time. This is so for two obvious reasons. First, since every period of human history has its own particular problems, the historian’s attention must necessarily shift according to the changing problems of the times. Second, as learning advances with the passing of each day, the historian’s understanding of past events also becomes ever-increasingly profound. One example will suffice for the purpose of illustration. The state of Lu’s initiation of a tax on an acre in 594 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> was a very important historical event that was emphatically noted in all three commentaries to the <i class="calibre9">Chunqiu</i> <span>春</span><span>秋</span> (Spring and Autumn Annals)<i class="calibre9">.</i> Later institutional historians also called attention to this event. And yet, its full significance is only understood after modern social and economic historiography has advanced enough to enable historians to place it in the proper perspective. But the rise of modern social and economic historiography is exactly where the problem of our age lies.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If historical studies change with the changing times, and historians often disagree in their interpretations, then is there such a thing as objectivity in history after all? In reality, there is no basis at all for doubting the objectivity of historical knowledge. Observed by historians of different viewpoints, history can only become ever more objectively evident. As the scenic wonders of Mount Lu are proverbially described&mdash;“Looked at horizontally, it appears to be a mountain range; sideways, it assumes the shape of a peak. It can be all things to all men, according to whether they are far or near, high or low.” Indeed, the “true face” of Mount Lu can objectively exist in the eyes of travelers approaching it from various directions. We are, of course, not to conclude that Mount Lu has numberless forms or that it has no form at all. As early as two thousand years ago, Sima Qian stated that the purpose of historical inquiry was “to comprehend the changes of the past and present and to propose one school of interpretation.” In so saying, he touched on the very center of the issues relating to objectivity and subjectivity in historical studies. “The changes of the past and present” are objective history; Sima Qian’s attempt to “comprehend” them was, of course, a subjective interpretation by the historian. In the case of the <i class="calibre9">Records of the Grand Historian</i>, one can see that Sima Qian’s subjective interpretation not only does no violence to objective history but has actually illuminated for us those “changes of the past and present.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Sima Qian allowed that his own book was but “one school of interpretation.” Although his interpretation was challenged by Ban Gu <span>班</span><span>固</span> (32&ndash;92), the latter had to concede that the <i class="calibre9">Records of the Grand Historian</i> was soundly based on a critical investigation of evidence: “I have gathered up and brought together the scattered old traditions of the world and compared them with the deeds and events of the past as known to us,” as Sima Qian put it.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1773" id="calibre_link-1797" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> The <i class="calibre9">Records of the Grand Historian</i> represents the union between “interpretation” and “criticism” in the tradition of Chinese historiography; it is an excellent model for combining subjectivity and objectivity in historical writing. That Sima Qian should have such a remarkable achievement is attributable in part to his profound empathy for his own times.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Still, Ban Gu criticized Sima Qian, saying:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>His moral judgments stray greatly from those of the sages; in discussing the great Way, he places the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Lao Tzu [Laozi] ahead of the Six Classics; in his account of the Wandering Knights, he honors the wicked and disparages the worthy, and in his treatise on economic affairs, he gives precedence to the powerful and the wealthy and holds in contempt the poor and the lowly.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1774" id="calibre_link-1798" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1330" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>These criticisms, however, only serve to show the admirable qualities of Sima Qian as a historian. His history was completed during the time when the court was carrying out the policy of making Confucianism the philosophy of the state. Yet these official policies did not blind him to the variety of active social and cultural forces that a monolithic government was not pleased to condone. The <i class="calibre9">Records of the Grand Historian</i> made a point of presenting the activities of the Huang-Lao Daoists, the Wandering Knights, and the merchants. On the one hand, the author was committed to the goal of “one school of interpretation,” and on the other, he succeeded in faithfully reflecting his own times. The subjectivity and objectivity of historical studies are here unified, and not contradictory to each other.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">“HISTORICAL LAWS” AND THE NEEDS OF THE TIMES</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>If we characterize the attitude of the Data school toward its own time as being deliberately indifferent, then we might say that the Interpretation school is just the opposite. There is too close a connection between an interpretation and the times in which the interpretation is made&mdash;so much so that at times, the distinction between the past and the present is blurred. That these two schools should run counter to each other to such an extent is understandable, as they each hold to their own way of dealing with history. The Data school pursues history for its own sake; it does not consider elements not directly related to historical studies at all relevant, including what we may call the “times.” Data school adherents take satisfaction in examining one isolated historical fact after another. The Interpretation school in modern China, on the other hand, has all along not been studying history from a purely scholarly viewpoint. Interpretation school adherents mainly aim to make the past serve the present&mdash;in more concrete terms, to seek historical justification for their political activities. I must add that there is nothing wrong in such an idea; on the contrary, it is a virtue if one is purely motivated by love of his country and his people in his study of history. We see this in late Qing historians, such as Zhang Binglin <span>章</span><span>炳</span><span>麟</span> (1869&ndash;1936) and Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929), who arrived at many important conclusions in Chinese history from their anti-Manchu, revolutionary viewpoint. Indeed, there has been a long tradition of interpretive historiography in China, and Marxist historical materialism is but one of them. Today, however, in examining the Interpretation school, we have no choice but to take Marxism as our main object.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1338" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Since “Interpretative” historians are dictated exclusively by the demands of political reality, they inevitably fail to distinguish between the past and the present, and as a result, deny the possibility of historical objectivity. Because he is writing history to meet an immediate need, an “Interpretative” historian may appear to be analyzing the past but is, in reality, ever concerned with its application to present conditions. Thus, the past becomes merely a storehouse for historians to dip in for selective information, and whatever objective existence and development history might claim to have becomes completely meaningless. Moreover, this attitude toward history is in direct proportion to the urgency of political commitment; when political demands are great, all rules and regulations governing the search for historical truths can be relegated to the ash can. In the late 1970s, the dominance of what is called <i class="calibre9">history by innuendo</i> (<i class="calibre9">yingshe shixue</i> <span>影</span><span>射</span><span>史</span><span>學</span>) in mainland China is an extreme example.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1775" id="calibre_link-1799" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In principle, we are sympathetic to the belief that historical studies should answer to the needs of the times, but we must also make it clear that a historian should try to keep a distance between historical inquiry and the reality in which he finds himself. History enlightens us, passes on lessons to us, but it can never directly serve reality. Historiography as a discipline should be respected for its integrity. Not to respect it will not only destroy history itself but also confuse us in our understanding of our own times. Take natural science, for example: there is basic or theoretical research in any branch of science, and this is the primary requirement for a scientific discipline. Naturally, we hope that basic research will eventually prove to have practical usefulness, but we should by no means interfere with the disciplinary requirements of science in our haste to seek its practical application. This is equally true in the study of history. Without basic research, history cannot stand as an independent scholarly discipline. As to when and how such basic research could be applied, and what kind of use it could generate, no one can say beforehand. What we do know is that, like any other science, history cannot be totally useless if research is carefully conducted with the needs of the times in mind.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The Interpretation school has its own theoretical dilemma. We have pointed out the inadequacy of the “Dataist” conception of historical objectivity, but the Interpretation school, especially its Marxist branch, fails to give a clear account of the so-called historical laws. “Interpretation” historiography carries with it the responsibility of supporting political movements, and the strongest support historiography can give to any political movement is to proclaim that it represents an irresistible historical tide. Any such declaration could easily dissolve the will to resist on the part of all opponents. The effect is similar to the Mandate of Heaven theory with which a new dynasty in China’s past always proclaimed that it “was acting according to the will of Heaven.” But the Mandate of Heaven theory has long since been declared bankrupt, and in this day and age, only science has the persuasive force that is irresistible. And so the “tide of history” presents itself to us under the guise of scientific inevitability.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1080" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The “inevitability theory” is founded on the basis of “historical laws.” It claims that a certain historical trend is irresistible because the law of history dictates it so. Modern science has already proved beyond a doubt that all things in nature develop according to natural laws. Now that historiography has proved to its own satisfaction that the development of history also follows certain laws, then any historical trend that follows these laws must of necessity be irresistible. Allow me to cite historical materialism as an example to see how “historical laws” are defined.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In Marxist materialism, there are two basic components that carry with them the meaning of “law,” or, more appropriately, are emphatically declared as “law” by Marxists. First, chronologically, human society must necessarily go through five stages, namely, primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, and socialism. Second, in terms of structure, modes of production in our material life are the bases that determine the superstructure of political, social, and cultural achievement.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In the first place, Marx based his five-stage theory on what he observed to have occurred in Western Europe, and he did not consider it to be universally applicable. He was strongly opposed to having it applied to Russia, as suggested by his followers. He clearly pointed out that the particular historical experience of Western Europe could not be transformed into a historio-philosophical theory of a general path that all people were fated to tread. He further pointed out that anyone attempting to apply a general historio-philosophical theory does not understand history because such a theory is by nature suprahistorical.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1776" id="calibre_link-1800" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup> Frustrated by his followers’ zeal in their loose application of his historical theories, he once even declared angrily in French, “Je ne suis pas Marxiste.” Since Marx did not claim that his historical generalizations should be extended beyond Western Europe, this five-stage theory cannot be said to have the universality of a scientific law.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As to the second point, Marx indeed stated it in universalistic terms. However, modern philosophical analysis shows that the relationship between modes of production and the so-called superstructures still lacks clarity and thus cannot be recognized as being even close to what scientists would define as “law.” If all the superstructures such as philosophy, art, and religion are determined by modes of production, then a given mode of production could at best determine one kind of philosophy, art, or religion. How, then, are we to determine which one of them is typical? How are we to explain the modes of production on which other types are based? When we say “determine,” how is it defined? Questions such as these are never clearly spelled out. Generally speaking, it is indeed a profound observation to say that there are inner affinities between material and spiritual lives, and this observation has had a tremendous impact on the development of modern historiography and sociology. Nonetheless, until now, we are still at a loss as to how those affinities can be formulated as precise laws. Actually, Engels made some revision in his old age concerning this point. In a letter he wrote to Joseph Bloch on September 21, 1890, he had the following to say: “According to the materialist conception of history, the determining element in history is <i class="calibre9">ultimately</i> the production and reproduction in real life. If therefore somebody twists this into the statement that the economic factor is the <i class="calibre9">only</i> determining one, he transforms it into a meaningless, abstract and absurd phrase.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1777" id="calibre_link-1801" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="noindent1"><span><a id="calibre_link-1335" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Therefore, according to Engels’s definitive thinking in his later years, the second component of historical materialism did not qualify as scientific law in the strict sense of the term.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">MODELS BASED ON WESTERN EXPERIENCES</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>“Interpretationist” historians have subjected modern Chinese historiography to another negative influence, and that is their use of models based on Western historical experience to comprehend the actual development of Chinese history. The Marxist five-stage theory, discussed above, is a case in point. This trend is by no means limited to those who advocate historical materialism, however. For example, the once-fashionable practice of periodization, that is, dividing Chinese history into ancient, medieval, and modern periods, is obviously a reflection of Western historiography. Naitô Torajirô once compared the Song with the Renaissance, and regarded the Song as the beginning of modern China. While this “Naitô hypothesis” has taken every possible effort to incorporate the special characteristics of Chinese historical development, it remains basically modeled on the West.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Both “laws” and models share a common assumption that all nations in the world go through a universally similar process of historical development. There are two sides from which to view this assumption: the theoretical and the practical. On the theoretical side, we can neither affirm nor deny this assumption. Analytical philosophers and professional historians alike tend to reject it on the theoretical level, because they have been frustrated by the difficulties encountered in the speculative philosophy of history. However, the rejection may be taken more as a revelation of their profound sense of frustration at this stage than as a definite indication of a “dead-end street.” The present state of historical studies varies greatly from country to country, and comparative historiography is still in its infancy. In short, we are unable as yet to make a final pronouncement with any degree of assurance.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>On the practical side, because historical and social sciences are better developed in the West, many people tend to accept the conclusions derived from studies of Western historical experiences as a universal “law” or model. Is capitalist society a necessary stage of every social development? Strictly speaking, Western Europe (with the United States as its extension) is the only historical example of this proposition; Marx’s cautious attitude in this connection is, therefore, still appreciated today. One or two examples do not make for universal laws, nor do they set up any models. Bertrand Russell once remarked, only half seriously, that “China has always been an exception to all rules.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1778" id="calibre_link-1802" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> Even if this is true, I am afraid the problem does not lie with China but with all those rules. Russell was undoubtedly talking about rules derived from Western experiences.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1329" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>However, China cannot actually be an exception to all rules. I quote Russell only to remind historians that any attempt in the search for a universally valid law in the realm of human affairs cannot do without taking Chinese experiences into account in the first place. The problem with historians of the Interpretation school does not lie in their commitment to seeking universal laws or models; it lies in their failure to adequately understand the concept of “law” as rigorously defined in science. They have mistaken certain partially effective generalizations about Western history for universally valid historical laws. Thus, instead of searching for a pattern of historical development based on the rich Chinese data, they have chosen to make the Chinese evidence fit Western theories. Such a Procrustean approach has aroused strong nationalistic feelings in historians who value Chinese tradition. In their eyes, to hold up the West as a model is indicative of a total psychological capitulation to Western culture. Some of them even question the very wisdom of introducing Western historiography to China at all. Though China has lagged behind in natural sciences, they ask, is there any reason why we should have to follow the West in historiography, in which China has had a glorious tradition of her own?</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>We respect such feelings of national pride. However, what is involved here are not just simple emotional issues. “Models” and “laws” are attractive not merely because they are Western in origin; a more important reason, perhaps, is that they have come marching under the banner of science. Science has had an immense power of persuasion since the nineteenth century, and historical studies have constantly been under its pressure. The impact is still visible today, with not a few Western positivist philosophers and social scientists believing that history is concerned merely with the investigation and organization of facts and that theoretical work should be left to the social scientists. Professional historians in the West feel equally hard-pressed to face up to this kind of challenge. We might say that it is against this background that we have seen the rise of the critical philosophy of history in the past few decades, with the problem concerning the nature of historical knowledge at its center. It is also against this background that the growing influence, in recent years, of the Collingwoodian and Hermeneutic theories concerning historical understanding must be understood. Hence, in the final analysis, this is a dispute of a crucial nature between modern natural science and the humanities. Therefore, it would be grossly misleading to identify this as a dispute between Western theories and Chinese data, which would allow excessive nationalistic feelings to be aroused over the question of historical research.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">BEYOND THE POSITIVISTIC CONFINES OF DATAISM AND INTERPRETATIONISM</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1315" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Above, we have tried to delineate the main trends of modern Chinese historiography through a critical review of the two major historical schools. We are not primarily interested in criticizing the past, however, much less in denying the achievements of Chinese historiography since the beginning of this century. Historical thinking today has reached a new level of sophistication. The time has come to pause and reconsider for a moment. To seek new breakthroughs in Chinese historical studies, we must first reflect, theoretically as well as practically, on the course that we have so far traveled. Reflection provides the point of departure for a new journey.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>However dissatisfied we are with the “Dataists” and the “Interpretationists,” due recognition must nevertheless be given to their respective contributions to the study of Chinese history. Indeed, they will undoubtedly constitute the basis for future development. As science, history must also be founded on the shoulders of giants. Even if there have been only ordinary people and no giants, we still must stand on their shoulders so as to have a better vision of the road that lies ahead of us. As a matter of fact, both schools of Chinese historiography have their own strong bases. Though blown out of proportion on a massive scale, their core beliefs will nonetheless stand the test of time. After all, as pointed out in the beginning of this essay, “data” and “interpretations” are the two essential elements of historical inquiry.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1012" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In terms of origins, Dataism and Interpretationism in Chinese historiography can be demonstrably shown to have been deeply rooted in two different approaches in the West seeking to transform history into science. We have already noted that concepts such as “laws” and “models” of the Interpretation school are borrowings from natural science. But we need to be further reminded that the Dataist emphasis on “data” and “facts” also derives its inspiration from science. According to nineteenth-century positivists, every natural science must begin with collection of data and establishment of facts. However, in the positivist program, one finds a symbiotic relation between facts and laws, for the ascertaining of the former would necessarily lead to the discovery of the latter. In general, late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century European, and especially German, historians were divided into two opposing camps with each having been exclusively concerned with one part of the positivist program. Thus we see, on the one hand, that Leopold von Ranke’s method dealing with the criticism of historical documents evolved into a tradition known as “scientific history”; on the other hand, Karl Lamprecht led an anti-Rankean movement in quest of general historical laws.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1779" id="calibre_link-1803" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup> The dichotomy between Dataism and Interpretationism in China is quite reminiscent of this German scene. As a matter of fact, evidence shows that while the Chinese Interpretationists owe a heavy spiritual debt to Hegel and Marx, the Dataists are no less true intellectual heirs of the Rankean school than of the Qing philological tradition. In criticizing the mutually exclusive attitudes held by the Dataists and the Interpretationists, however, we are not suggesting some kind of modus vivendi. It would be naive optimism, for instance, to think that one could discover the general historical laws as advocated by Lamprecht with the help of Ranke’s “scientific method.” Instead, we believe that we can now transcend the positivistic perspectives of both Dataism and Interpretationism. It is an indisputable fact that Clio has been steadily gaining scientific respectability in the modern world without becoming Mr. Science. Once we break through the positivistic confines of Dataism and Interpretationism, our expectations as to the prospect of historical inquiry in China will also be of a different kind. With this understanding in mind, we wish to make some perhaps all-too-common observations.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1331" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>We have all along stressed that history is a knowledge of a synthetic and comprehensive nature and that it must thrive on results achieved in other fields of knowledge. We should now give a clearer explanation. Many scholarly disciplines are directly or indirectly related to history; these include, in the past, diplomatics and philology, and now, social sciences and even some branches of natural sciences. Now, in the face of the ever-growing sophistication and specialization of knowledge, how are we to expect historians to first familiarize themselves with all branches of knowledge before they engage in historical research? A few special branches of historical studies now require very specialized knowledge and have long gone beyond what we normally consider to be within the bounds of history proper. For example, economic history in the strict sense has become a branch more of economics than of history. Similarly, history of science has long declared its independence. Therefore, when we speak of the synthetic and comprehensive nature of historical knowledge, all we are saying is that historians, in investigating a historical phenomenon of a certain period, should take into account not only the chronological perspective in which this phenomenon is related to its antecedents and consequences but also the structural perspective in which this phenomenon is related to other events of the same period. This activity is quite different from that of the social scientists, who are primarily concerned with the search for abstract principles common to all similar phenomena or with understanding a certain type of phenomenon by referring it to some established laws. Take, for example, the study of the aristocratic clan system (<i class="calibre9">mendi</i> <span>門</span><span>第</span> or <i class="calibre9">menfa</i> <span>門</span><span>閥</span>) in medieval China. To arrive at a comprehensive understanding, historians have to consider on the one hand its evolutionary changes both before and after, and on the other, its place in the context of contemporary political, social, economic, and cultural developments. As such, we find that the historian’s task is different from that undertaken by sociologists or anthropologists in their study of the kinship system in medieval aristocracy. A historian will unavoidably touch upon the problem of the kinship system or whatever problems other social scientists are interested in, but he “touches upon” them only as and when historiographic needs dictate. He does not have to go into the study of any social science systematically. Any historian with some training in modern scholarship is capable of doing this, even as a sociologist merely refers to some basic historical findings to explain a certain historical background in the process of his research, without finding it necessary to conduct an independent historical inquiry. Indeed, this has been much discussed in the Chinese scholarly tradition as the issue of “erudition versus specialization.” As Zhang Xuecheng <span>章</span><span>學</span><span>誠</span> (1738&ndash;1801) aptly put it: “Of all the things in the universe, there are those which are of our immediate concern, and we will not miss even the tiniest particle of them. There are also those which are of no immediate concern to us, and we will not worry about them even if they are as big as Mount Tai.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1780" id="calibre_link-1804" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> Thus, individual historians all have their auxiliary sciences; these sciences are, however, dictated by the “immediacy of concern” of their specialized fields.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">“METHOD” AS UNDERSTOOD BY CHINESE HISTORIANS</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>There is the question of methodology. Both the Dataist and the Interpretationist schools in China emphasize methods, and each claims that its own method is the most scientific one. As a result, the idea has prevailed among modern Chinese historians that the progress in historical studies depends mainly on the progress in historical methods. There is some truth in this, but what are historical methods? Nobody seems to have given the question much thought.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>A careful examination of the term “method” as understood by modern Chinese historians will show that it contains two meanings. The first is to think of it as merely an extension of scientific method in historical inquiry. The famous dictum of the late Dr. Hu Shi, “boldness in doubt and hypothesis coupled with a meticulous care in seeking verification,” belongs to this first kind of meaning.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1781" id="calibre_link-1805" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> The concept of “hypothesis” started with the publication of <i class="calibre9">La Science et l</i>’<i class="calibre9">hypothèse</i> by the French mathematician Henri Poincaré in 1902. Poincaré suggested that since the word “law” connotes something immutable, it would help to reduce confusion by replacing it with the term “hypothesis,” for the so-called laws in science are often overthrown by new discoveries. This conceptual change naturally affected social sciences and history as well. Those nineteenth-century “laws of social development” or “historical laws,” including that of historical materialism, are now merely considered “hypotheses.” In any case, whether one calls it “law” or “hypothesis,” neither belongs uniquely to historiography.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1040" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The second meaning of “method” is to understand it as the analytical techniques in various special disciplines, such as astronomy, geology, archaeology, and biology, which can often be useful in solving problems in historical studies. Obviously, these techniques are not methods unique to history. In fact, even those methods that are closely related to traditional historiography, such as diplomatic and textual criticism, cannot, strictly speaking, be regarded as unique to historical research. A person who specializes in the criticism of documents is a philologist; he is not a historian, even though historians must necessarily devote some time to textual studies. It is not hard to imagine a situation, especially in the study of modern or contemporary history, in which a historian does not have to face any problem requiring serious textual criticism, much less the employment of philological knowledge to collate texts. Naturally, a historian has his own unique procedure of work, such as ascertaining evidence, establishing the authenticity of facts, discovering the relations between historical facts, and interpreting changes, but these tasks are closely related to the development of other scholarly disciplines. The rise of new scholarship sometimes opens up a new vista for the historian, leading him to a new understanding of “evidence” or “fact.” What did not use to constitute “evidence” or “fact” may now become some very important “evidence” or “fact.” The rise of “psychohistory” in the West is an immediate example.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>What we have discussed above is not intended to prove that there is no historical method; we wish only to point out that there are no permanent or fixed methods. On the technical level, history is constantly appropriating methods from other related sciences for its own use. This is in accord with what we mentioned above as the synthetic and comprehensive nature of history as a discipline. If there is no permanent or fixed method in historical studies, does that mean history relies completely on other sciences and has lost its own identity? This is an unnecessary worry. As pointed out by Robert F. Berkhofer Jr., himself a strong advocate of social science methods in the study of history, a historian’s attempts to study man’s past holistically and his interest in historic time as a total dated system distinguish his “concern as to both goal and method from those of the social scientists.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1782" id="calibre_link-1806" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>However, as the saying goes, “Scholarship is like assisting a drunkard to walk&mdash;no sooner do you help him move to the right than he falls to the left.” Although we think it important to be always open-minded about new historical methods, we should at the same time warn against blind acceptance of every new method because it is fashionable. Any method that is derived from empirical science has its limits; therefore, if we are to borrow its use, we must take into consideration the different results that may obtain because of the differences in empirical background. Furthermore, it takes repeated experiments on the part of experts before a new method can fully develop. The best works in psychohistory are written by psychologists rather than historians. Up to now, we have had more failures than successes in the writing of psychohistory, a fact that caused Jacques Barzun to raise his voice in serious criticism of certain unhealthy tendencies in the development of this field. What Barzun had to say is a useful rectifying warning to historians who tend to fancy methodological fashions.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1783" id="calibre_link-1807" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1334" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>There are no fixed methods for the study of history, and every new method brings with it numberless pitfalls. This fact alone is enough to show that there is no shortcut in historical inquiry, and historians have to grope laboriously and patiently for their own methods. It has always been like this; this is nothing new. A century ago, Theodor Mommsen said: “It is moreover a dangerous and harmful illusion for the professor of history to believe that historians can be trained at the University in the same way as philologists or mathematicians most assuredly can be. One can say with more justification of the historian than of the mathematician or the philologist that he is not trained but born, not educated but self-educated.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1784" id="calibre_link-1808" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> This is the testimony of a great practitioner of our craft. Herein lies the difficulty of the study of history, and herein lies its attraction.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">THE BASIC PATTERN OF CHINESE CULTURE</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Since we do not accept the concept of “law” advanced by the Interpretation school and are equally dissatisfied with the departmentalized and fragmentary approach represented by the Dataist historians, then what do we wish to see in terms of the future of Chinese historiography? What kind of direction should we follow? As to the first point, to put it in the simplest terms, we hope that historical research will help us to gradually understand from various angles the basic pattern of Chinese culture and its process of development. At the same time, we hope that a clearer knowledge of the past will enlighten us on our present historical situation.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1052" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>We cannot deny that in thus phrasing our expectation as to the future of Chinese historical studies, we are already advocating something. First, we affirm that cultures have patterns, and Chinese culture likewise has its own unique pattern. This is a hypothesis now largely shared by scholars, especially historians, anthropologists, and sociologists, but it still needs to be reemphasized. The reason is that there are people who, under the severe influence of the Western model of thinking, regard the difference between Chinese and Western cultures as lying not in different patterns but in different stages of development&mdash;that is to say, they believe that the West has moved into the modern era while China is still in the Middle Ages. Conceptions like this are still very influential today, and the Marxist periodization of Chinese history is founded on this basis. Second, we reaffirm the belief that history is a developmental process. In other words, we believe that history is not just an accidental aggregation of disconnected events; history is rather a continuum and manifests itself in what historians speak of as trends, currents, or tendencies. In traditional Chinese historiographical terms, this continuity is called <i class="calibre9">shi</i> <span>勢</span> (potentiality or momentum). Behind the trends or currents, however, we do not see such things as “providence,” “reason,” or “law,” which are hypotheses neither proven nor disproved, at least as of the present. We cannot therefore be certain whether any trends or currents in history are “inevitable” or “irresistible.” We only believe that, if there are historical trends or currents, they can be found through historical research and can be interpreted rationally. On this point, we differ basically from both the Dataists and the Interpretationists. Finally, we recognize that it is possible to have a dialogue between the past and the present (and to some extent, even the future), a recognition that receives its strongest support from the fact that there are indeed continuities in history. We stress the need to maintain a proper relationship between historiography and the times mainly because we are aware of the importance of continuity. The Chinese present is naturally not just determined by the Chinese past, but the unique pattern and process of development of Chinese culture created enough “momentum” (<i class="calibre9">shi</i>) to provide the dynamics for China to come into its present form. The same “momentum” has not died out and shall continue to pressure us to move forward. Historians nowadays no longer believe that the past serves as a mirror to reflect a knowledge of the future, and prediction in the strict scientific sense indeed lies outside the province of historiography. Nonetheless, thanks to the insightful studies of historians, we are better able to understand the nature and impact of the “historical momentum,” and this understanding sometimes does help indicate the way out of our present condition. The great French medievalist, Marc Bloch, wrote a book entitled <i class="calibre9">Strange Defeat</i> during the agony of the Second World War and published in 1946; his analysis of the fall of France is profound and powerful because “the tragedy is seen through the eyes of a man who has traced with affectionate attention more than a millennium of his country’s history.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1785" id="calibre_link-1809" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup> There is no example more vivid and moving than this of what E. H. Carr called “an unending dialogue between the past and the present.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1786" id="calibre_link-1810" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> Even if historical studies do not enable us to predict, historians after all cannot help but constantly remind themselves of what might happen in the future. The more we understand the past, by that much more we will add to the basis on which to judge the development of the future. The famous Dutch historian Johan Huizinga hit the nail on the head when he said, “As for history, the question is always ‘Whither?’ ”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1787" id="calibre_link-1811" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>What, then, is the road that lies ahead for Chinese historiography? It is difficult to give a concrete answer to this question. We rather wish again to discuss some principles.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The Dataist historians take the collection and examination of historical data as their main task, and consciously resist any attempt at “interpretive comprehension.” As a result, there is no desire on their part to touch upon large issues such as the pattern and process of development of Chinese culture. By contrast, the Interpretationist historians place special emphasis on these questions, but unfortunately, they have been entrapped by Western models of interpretation. Extremists among these Interpretationist historians even sought to fit Chinese historical data into one specific school of Western theory. More than merely narrowing the possible range within which historians look for answers, this also severely limits their capacity to ask new questions. The Dataist historians reject historiography on a theoretical level; the Interpretationist historians trade off their own productivity for foreign credit. The consequence is the same: both fall back on China’s historical data and take pride in the wealth of them. As a result, modern Chinese historiography presents the strange spectacle of an abundance of materials but a paucity of scholarship.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1002" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>From here on, we who are engaged in the study of history will have to proceed in two directions: to hold up the challenge of the aforementioned big questions as our ultimate goals, and to maintain an open-minded attitude toward all kinds of theories, methods, and viewpoints. We are aware that big questions such as those raised above cannot have a once-and-for-all answer, but once we have made them the ultimate goal of our studies, historians will more clearly recognize the direction and significance of their endeavors. An open-minded attitude is especially important, for it is with this kind of attitude that we could hope gradually to arrive at sensible judgments that are in accord with Chinese historical realities. In the process of historical research, competing interpretations are unavoidable, and indeed, this is only normal in scholarly progress. There can never be one absolute historical interpretation, but it is not too much to hope that a common basis of discussion be established on the major issues of history. There, the results that are founded on reason and reliable data will have the power of lasting persuasion.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">COMPARISON AND ANALOGY IN HISTORICAL INQUIRY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>The search for the unique pattern and developmental process of Chinese culture implicitly takes on a comparative viewpoint. Without comparison, we shall not be able to illustrate the special pattern of Chinese culture. By comparison we mean comparison in relation to other cultural systems, such as what are commonly referred to as Indian culture, Western culture, or Islamic culture. The cultural categorization proposed by A. J. Toynbee is useful for reference here. Those who criticize Toynbee criticize his attempt to search for generalities or laws, but not his advocacy of comparative viewpoints.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Not only can historical developments of other cultures be used in our comparative studies, but community studies (not confined to primitive societies) conducted by social scientists (especially anthropologists and sociologists) that lead to better understanding of culture will also enlighten us. Max Weber once said that man is an animal suspended in “webs of significance” spun by himself. The anthropologist Clifford Geertz takes those “webs” as culture. Geertz further points out that the study of culture is “not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1788" id="calibre_link-1812" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup> There can be no doubt that historiography is much closer to sociology and anthropology than to experimental science. “Interpretation” as used by Geertz is at least partially similar to the “interpretive comprehension” that has characterized traditional Chinese historiography. Naturally, we are aware that we are not simply seeking to understand a static “web of significance”; rather we are searching for the metamorphoses that culture experiences in historical time.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1065" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the past several decades, the importance of the comparative point of view to the study of Chinese history has been clearly recognized among historians of all persuasions in China. Unfortunately, comparison in practice often turns into analogy of one dubious kind or another. Thus, we find Confucius being compared analogously to Socrates, Mencius to Plato, and Xunzi to Aristotle. In this connection, a particularly notable example is provided by Liang Qichao’s influential book <i class="calibre9">Qingdai xueshu gailun</i> <span>清</span><span>代</span><span>學</span><span>術</span><span>概</span><span>論</span> (A general introduction to Qing dynasty scholarship). Throughout this work, as rightly observed by Benjamin I. Schwartz, there is a “sustained and forced analogy between European Renaissance and the Qing period.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1789" id="calibre_link-1813" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> It may not be too harsh to say that analogies of this kind, when carried to extremes, serve only to conceal from view rather than reveal the salient features of Chinese history.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>On the other hand, it must also be pointed out that analogy as a comparative method, with all its imperfections, is often unavoidable and, indeed, sometimes even necessary in the early stages of cultural contact. The Buddhist method of analogy known as <i class="calibre9">geyi</i> <span>格</span><span>義</span> (matching the meaning) is a case in point. As late as the fourth century, Chinese Buddhists still found it desirable to “equate the contents of the <i class="calibre9">sûtras</i> with external writings in order to establish examples that would create understanding.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1790" id="calibre_link-1814" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> The so-called external writings referred mainly to Daoist philosophical works. In other words, Indian ideas were explained in the familiar terminology of Chinese thought. It was only when the Chinese Buddhists were able to distinguish the various nuances of these imported concepts that they found the <i class="calibre9">geyi</i> analogy too distortive to be useful, and therefore abandoned it. Nevertheless, the comparative perspective provided by Buddhism has since been firmly established in the Chinese intellectual tradition.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As of today, the introduction of Western learning to China has remained largely in the Buddhist <i class="calibre9">geyi</i> stage. We are still far from being able to employ the comparative point of view in historical inquiry with confidence and ease. As we look back and reflect on the development of Chinese historiography in the past decades, however, we must admit that progress has been made in this respect, even if the progress is relatively slow. As time goes on, we shall see that the period of independent growth of Chinese Buddhism will also come for Chinese historiography. There is thus no reason for us to lament the fallacious analogism in this early stage; there is even less reason for us to abandon the comparative perspective all together.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1048" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It is true that in the philosophy of history, fallacies or false analogy are topics that are constantly subject to extensive as well as intensive analysis. Philosophers and historians alike nonetheless admit that analogy has many uses when it comes to the methodology of explaining a concept or a phenomenon. Simply stated, an analogy not only tries to find similarity among diversity, it also attempts to find diversity in similarity. Metaphor is an abridged form of analogy often used by historians. A metaphor concentrates on the similarities of two entities and uses them to explain one another. However, a similarity in part cannot obliterate the dissimilarity in the whole, and even within the similar parts there is room for dissimilarities in detail. Therefore, if we are able to employ analogy appropriately, then continued progress in historical inquiry will be assured. Therefore, in the study of Chinese history, what we must guard against is not the use of analogy as a comparative method but its abuse. It is certainly misleading to speak analogously of the intellectual history of the Qing Period as a whole in terms of the Renaissance. Nevertheless, on certain levels with reference to particular developments, such as the rise of philology and scholarship as the sure basis for faith, the Qing scholars may indeed be fruitfully compared to the Christian Humanists of the Renaissance and Reformation. It is also questionable to draw an analogy between the rise of the “Hundred Schools” in classical China and philosophical development in ancient Greece. Still, the notion of “philosophic breakthrough” as used by historians, philosophers, and sociologists today does provide us with a comparative perspective in terms of which transcendence in ancient China may be more intelligently explained in connection with a similar development in other ancient cultures such as Greece, Israel, and India. Other Western concepts such as “despotism,” “feudalism,” “revolution,” “class,” “social mobility,” “social structure,” etc., have also been widely used in Chinese historical works, and though the empirical content of these terms is found in the Western experience, with appropriate definition, they could be employed to analyze Chinese history. Liu Xie <span>劉</span><span>勰</span> (ca. 465&ndash;ca. 522) once said in the “Bixing” <span>比</span><span>興</span> chapter of his <i class="calibre9">Wenxin diaolong</i><span>文</span><span>心</span><span>雕</span><span>龍</span> (Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons): “Things which are as far apart as Hu [in the north] and Yue [in the South] may through their similarities be as close as liver and gall.” He further said: “Throughout all the varieties of the <i class="calibre9">bi</i>, its excellence lies in the aptness of the representation. A writer is valueless if, trying to carve a swan, he succeeds only in approximating a duck.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1791" id="calibre_link-1815" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> What Liu Xie had to say here about the idea of <i class="calibre9">bi</i> <span>比</span> (metaphor) in Chinese literature may be just as useful when borrowed to represent the basic attitude we hold about the comparative viewpoint in historical studies.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">A “MIDDLE-RANGE” APPROACH TO CHINESE HISTORIOGRAPHY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1408" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Finally, we wish to point out that in stressing the importance of “the unique pattern of the Chinese culture and its process of development” we are only suggesting that this should be taken as our ultimate goal in historical inquiry. In actual practice, however, we must emphasize that the study of history is a concrete and pragmatic endeavor, and has to be grounded on cumulative efforts. Without the effort of constant and adequate drilling, it is impossible to hope for any new breakthroughs either in approach or in conception. The “pure conversation” (<i class="calibre9">qingtan</i> <span>清</span><span>談</span>) of the Six Dynasties has been known as “speculation” par excellence, but Yan Zhitui <span>顏</span><span>之</span><span>推</span> (531&ndash;591) found it necessary to give the following advice: “He who has not looked over all the books in the world should not thoughtlessly make corrections or criticisms.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1792" id="calibre_link-1816" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> Of course, today, we cannot expect anyone to read all the books in the world, but a student of history should take upon him- or herself to adequately grasp all the basic sources relevant to the topic studied. Otherwise, he or she shall look very much like the kind of person Wang Sengqian <span>王</span><span>僧</span><span>虔</span> (426&ndash;485) admonished his son against:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>You have read only about five feet each of the scrolls of the <i class="calibre9">Laozi</i> and the <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i> [Classic of Changes]<i class="calibre9">.</i> You have neither known what Wang Bi <span>王</span><span>弼</span> and He Yan <span>何</span><span>晏</span> had to say, nor the differences between the commentaries of Ma (Rong <span>馬</span><span>融</span>) and Zheng (Xuan <span>鄭</span><span>玄</span>), and much less the meaning of various nuances and examples. And yet you have already picked up the fly-whisk and styled yourself as a Conversationalist. Nothing is more dangerous than this.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1793" id="calibre_link-1817" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>To engage in Pure Conversation without adequate scholarly maturity is dangerous enough; then what about historical studies, which require solid and concrete research? The revolutionary progress in modern Western historiography cannot be attributed entirely to new viewpoints or new methods. It is also a result of ever-intensifying effort in basic training over a long period of time. This latter fact should command more of our attention. The discovery and collation of ancient inscriptions, the preservation and study of archives, as well as the collection and editing of all kinds of historical documents and publication of monographs and journal articles&mdash;these are concrete examples of the results of intensive hard work in Western historiography. Indeed, it is on this solid foundation that concepts and new methods were developed.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1369" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As the adage has it: “Keep your eye on what is big, but try your hand at what is small.” We are now sure of the main task of Chinese historiography at the present stage; this is what is meant by “keeping your eyes on what is big.” If we could indeed keep our eyes on the main issue, we shall not fall into the pitfalls of fragmentations and blindness as the Dataist historians do. But however important the target, it is no substitute for actual work. We should not let concepts such as “cultural patterns” or “process of development” become mere slogans, working them into every single piece of historical writing. To do this is to be guilty of what the Interpretationist historians did, namely, to replace history with interpretation. There is no shortcut in historical studies, and we must perforce start with “what is small.” There are all kinds of critical problems in Chinese history that need continual analysis and synthesis, and it is our responsibility to work on those that are close to our respective intellectual inclination and professional training. There exists a dynamic and dialectical relationship between analysis and synthesis. We have to try to synthesize when a problem of a specific time or subject has been analyzed to the extent of requiring primary synthesis. However, if in the process of synthesis we find that there are still inadequacies, then we shall have to start analyzing anew. It goes without saying that oftentimes the study of historical problems demands of historians that they simultaneously conduct analysis and synthesis on different levels. In any case, the value of a piece of historical work above all depends on the quality of its scholarship. From the practical standpoint, one naturally prefers that the range of the topic treated be small and easily manageable than big and tending toward the speculative. The “middle-range theory” proposed by the sociologist Robert Merton probably could provide historians with the best guidance. Merton chose to propose such a “golden mean” probably because he had been troubled by some of the overblown sociological theories that he felt could hardly admit of any empirical substantiation. His own scholarly achievement bears ample witness to such a principle, showing that it is both practical and workable.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1794" id="calibre_link-1818" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> History is also an empirical discipline, and Merton’s suggestion should serve its purpose well.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The field of Chinese historiography is immensely resourceful and should not be made a “happy hunting ground” for only a handful of bright and talented heroes. The need is to mobilize all earnest workers in the field so that they can devote their efforts to long-term and steady tilling to turn it into a fertile green land. If we compare the study of history to drinking water, then the most a historian could hope for is to acquire the ability of a Li Deyu <span>李</span><span>德</span><span>裕</span> (787&ndash;850), who is said to have been able to tell the difference between the water of the upper Yangzi and that of the lower Yangzi. He should never dream that he would be able to acquire the magical power of the Zen Master Mazu Daoyi <span>馬</span><span>祖</span><span>道</span><span>一</span> (709&ndash;788), who claimed to have “swallowed all the water of the West River in one gulp.” It is here that Zhuangzi’s wisdom has the best to offer: “When the mole drinks at the river, he takes no more than a bellyful.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-1795" id="calibre_link-1819" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Let this be the highest ideal of every student of history, and let us borrow this saying to symbolize our expectations for the future of Chinese historiography!</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span>The original version of this essay had the following two notes.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>By the editors of <i class="calibre9">Translation of Things Past</i>: This article is translated from the inaugural issue of <i class="calibre9">Shixue pinglun</i> <span>史</span><span>學</span><span>評</span><span>論</span> (Taipei, July 1979), an independent scholarly journal published quarterly by and for students of Chinese history. The article incorporated the views of a group of young historians who organized and edited the publication, and was originally intended as an Inaugural Message for the journal, hence the use of the editorial “we.” But since it was written by Professor Yü, and does not necessarily reflect the editors’ views in every respect, the decision was reached to publish the article under the name of the author and labeled “in lieu of an Inaugural Message.” In the present English version, the subheadings are supplied by <i class="calibre9">Renditions</i>. [That is, <i class="calibre9">Renditions-English Translation Magazine</i> (Chinese University of Hong Kong), no. 15 (Spring 1981): 7&ndash;26.&mdash;Eds.]</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1211" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>By Professor Yü Ying-shih: The English text of this article, as originally prepared by Drs. Thomas H. C. Lee and Chun-chieh Huang, is a remarkable achievement in the art of translation. It has met all three classical <i class="calibre9">Principles of Translation</i> set forth by A. F. Tytler two centuries ago: to give a complete transcript of the original ideas; to imitate the styles of the original author; and to preserve the ease of the original text&mdash;the three principles that have been immortalized by Yan Fu in China since the turn of the century in terms of <i class="calibre9">xin</i> <span>信</span> (faithfulness), <i class="calibre9">da</i> <span>達</span> (comprehensibility), and <i class="calibre9">ya</i> <span>雅</span> (elegance). [See Alexander Fraser Tytler, <i class="calibre9">Essay on the Principles of Translation</i> (New York: Dutton, [1791] 1907).&mdash;Eds.]</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>No one is more aware than the author of the numerous pitfalls and difficulties that must have been encountered in the course of undertaking this formidable task. I cannot thank the translators enough for their invaluable contributions.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As I was going through the translated text, however, it suddenly occurred to me that the original article should not be presented to an entirely different audience without changes. I felt that some of the things I said in my Chinese original need not be said in translation, and a good deal of them could be said better by saying them differently in a different language. These considerations eventually led to a revision of the text to an extent that I had not expected in the beginning. As a result, a few passages have been omitted, several paragraphs completely rewritten, and many expressions cast anew. In addition, a minimum of footnotes has also been provided. I am therefore solely responsible for the discrepancies that now exist between this English version and its Chinese original. Hopefully, in this case, a violation of the principle of faithfulness on the linguistic level will be compensated for by a better representation of the original ideas.</span></div>

<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">INTRODUCTION</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1165" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">T</span>he thesis of a “clash of civilizations” has been much debated since Samuel P. Huntington published his famous article in <i class="calibre9">Foreign Affairs</i> in 1993.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-241" id="calibre_link-277" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> In <i class="calibre9">The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order</i> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996; page numbers in parentheses for this title only), Huntington gives his original thesis a more detailed documentation and, at the same time, also somewhat modifies some of the sharp formulations in the earlier article. However, the book is essentially an elaboration, not a revision, of the original argument. To avoid distorting Huntington, I would like to present the core of his argument by quoting him:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>In the late 1980s the Communist world collapsed, and the Cold War international system became history. In the post-Cold War world, the most important distinctions among people are not ideological, political, or economic. They are cultural…. People define themselves in terms of ancestry, religion, language, history, values, customs, and institutions. They identify with cultural groups: tribes, ethnic groups, religious communities, nations, and, at the broadest level, civilizations. People use politics not just to advance their interests but also to define their identity. (21)</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1175" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Then he explains to us why this “reconfiguration of global politics” is likely to lead to a “clash of civilizations.” Again, in his own words:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Peoples and countries with similar cultures are coming together. Peoples and countries with different cultures are coming apart. Alignments defined by ideology and superpower relations are giving way to alignments defined by culture and civilization. Political boundaries increasingly are redrawn to coincide with cultural ones: ethnic, religious, and civilizational. Cultural communities are replacing Cold War blocs, and the fault lines between civilizations are becoming the central lines of conflict in global politics. (125)</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Now, how are we to evaluate such a grand theory? Since it lies beyond the limit of my expertise to comment comprehensively on Huntington’s thesis, I shall make only a few observations relating, directly or indirectly, to the purpose I have set myself in this essay.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>To begin with, I agree with Huntington that “a civilizational approach may be helpful to understanding global politics in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries” (14). This is so because it recognizes “culture” as very much relevant to the process of modernization in non-Western societies. In the case of China, for example, when American modernization theory was in its heyday, leading historians such as John K. Fairbank, Joseph Levenson, and Mary C. Wright generally viewed Confucianism as an obstacle to the modernization of China. In 1991, I also made the observation that “Clio has been taking a new turn in the direction of culture in the past two decades”; as a result, “culture as a relatively autonomous force in history is now more clearly recognized than ever before.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-242" id="calibre_link-278" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> To the extent that Huntington sees the Confucian tradition as a living cultural force in today’s China, I have no quarrel with the new “paradigm” he has proposed.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1139" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the second place, however, it is my considered opinion that Huntington’s sweeping discussion of post&ndash;Cold War reconfiguration of global politics requires serious qualifications. With the total collapse of the Communist system in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Cold War era indeed came to an abrupt end in the Western world in 1991. However, the same cannot be said of Asian communism. The Chinese mainland, North Korea, and Vietnam taken together&mdash;about 1.3 billion Asian people&mdash;comprise one-fifth of the world population and still live under Communist rule. The premature announcement of the coming of a worldwide post&ndash;Cold War era by Huntington and others in the West seems to suggest that communism in the East simply does not count. Here, the deep-seated West-centric bias of Western observers is unmistakably shown at its worst. It is true that since the adoption of the so-called openness and reform policies in the 1980s, mainland China has been undergoing very considerable economic change, and the ability of the Chinese Communist Party to control its people has also been decreasing. However, no one in his or her right mind can possibly deny the continuing existence of communism as a political system in China. The Four Cardinal Principles&mdash;the socialist path, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the leadership of the Chinese Party, and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought&mdash;are still very much in operation and, moreover, repeatedly emphasized by the party leadership. The beginning of the post&ndash;Cold War era in the West cannot be dated from the 1980s when the Soviet Union pursued a course of <i class="calibre9">glasnost</i> and <i class="calibre9">perestroika</i>. For the same reason, we cannot say, even by the widest stretch of imagination, that the Cold War is completely over in East Asia as it is in Europe. As a matter of fact, it is interesting to note that when then-Vice President Gore of the United States toured the DMZ (Korean Demilitarized Zone) in the Korean Peninsula in early 1997, he reportedly remarked, “The Cold War is still with us here!” When the Chinese Communists launched their missile exercises over the Taiwan straits in March 1996, the Cold War even turned heated.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>I agree with one critic who contends that Huntington at times tends to interpret the facts to suit his theory.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-243" id="calibre_link-279" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> It is obviously his overenthusiasm for the all-encompassing idea of a “clash of civilizations” that has led him to make the following statement: “In the post-Cold War world, culture is both a decisive and a unifying force. People separated by ideology but united by culture come together, as the two Germanys did and as the two Koreas and the several Chinas are beginning to” (28). In this case, Huntington’s distortion of facts to suit his theory is complete. He makes no distinction between a post&ndash;Cold War Europe and a Cold War Asia. There can be no question that ideology still separates the two Koreas as well as the two Chinas on the opposite sides of the Taiwan Strait. Even in the case of the two Germanys, it is also too superficial and simplistic to suggest that they “come together” because of “culture” yet are still separated by “ideology.” I am convinced that it is his obsession with his grand theory that has led him to believe that the Chinese Communists have somehow resumed their Confucian identity.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1153" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Last but not least, let me say a word or two about his idea of a “clash of civilizations” with respect to Confucianism. In his <i class="calibre9">Foreign Affairs</i> article of 1993, Huntington straightforwardly identified Chinese Communists as “Confucians.” It is to his credit that he toned down this kind of talk considerably in the 1996 book. However, he continues to define present-day China in terms of Confucianism, as if communism no longer mattered to the Chinese conduct of international affairs. This is clearly shown in his repeated reference to the so-called Confucian-Islamic connection. Central to the thesis of a “clash of civilizations” is his deep worry about a “Confucian-Islamic alliance.” Anyone who refuses to be blinded by theories can readily see that the “connection” exists only between the Communist regime in Beijing on the one hand and some of the anti-Western Islamic states on some others. The following words of Mu’ammar al-Qadhafi quoted in <i class="calibre9">The Clash of Civilizations</i> are worth quoting here:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>The new world order means that Jews and Christians control Muslims and if they can, they will after that dominate Confucianism and other religions in India, China, and Japan…. Now we hope to see a confrontation between China that heads the Confucianist camp and America that heads the Christian crusader camp. We have no justification but to be biased against the crusaders. We are standing with Confucianism, and, by allying ourselves with it and fighting alongside it in one international front, we will eliminate our mutual opponent. (239&ndash;240)</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Needless to say, Colonel Qadhafi’s rhetoric fits the “clash of civilizations” paradigm perfectly. However, one wonders whether Huntington really takes seriously and at face value the words of a man who, after all, is not particularly known for his understanding of Confucianism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Speaking of a “clash of civilizations,” the confrontation between Christianity and Islam indeed has its deep historical roots traceable to the Crusades of the twelfth century, if not earlier. Both religions derive their monotheism from a Jewish source. As such, both are equally possessive and exclusive in character, requiring total commitment on the part of their believers. In a sense, the clash between the two may be viewed as inevitable in hindsight, but what can we say about the possibility of a confrontation between China and the West? All I can say is that the present rivalry between China and the West (mainly the United States) makes sense only if it is understood, basically, as the unfinished business of the Cold War. Our minds become confused on this point for the following two reasons: first, many of us have been misled by the recent “post&ndash;Cold War” language, a language originated, as pointed out above, in a deep-seated West-centric bias. Second, in the last two years or so the Chinese Communist Party has skillfully manipulated Chinese nationalistic feelings of a fanatic kind directed specifically against the United States. With the bankruptcy of Marxist ideology, the party faces its most serious legitimacy crisis ever. It is much in evidence that the party is making a subtle move to resuscitate the bankrupted totalitarian ideology by pumping nationalism into it. This is clearly a move from “socialism” to “national socialism,” which is practically synonymous with Deng’s slogan “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” It is this new wave of nationalism that has often been mistaken as a revival of Confucian culture in China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-244" id="calibre_link-280" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1066" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Whether it is “socialism” or “national socialism,” China today is still very much under the sway of an avowedly anti-Western ideology of Western origins. In the name of “revolution,” this ideology must also of necessity take anti-Confucianism as its very point of departure. Up to this day, we have yet to discover a single instance of a positive statement about the Confucian tradition in the party’s official publications. Should the confrontation between communist China and the West become unavoidable, which no one in his or her right mind would like to see happen, the blame could in no way be laid on Confucianism. Whatever causes it might possibly involve, it will most certainly have nothing to do with a “clash of civilizations.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In what follows, I wish to give a brief account of how the Confucian elite responded to Western civilization when China came face to face with the West in recent centuries. I shall discuss this encounter under three headings: religion, science, and democracy. I believe that only through such a historical analysis can we get a more realistic sense as to the possibility of a clash between Confucian and Western civilizations.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">RELIGION</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Confucianism is not a religion in the ordinary Western sense. However, scholars today are in general agreement that there is a religious dimension in Confucianism with such notions as Heaven and <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> <span>道</span> as its focus. As a religion, Confucianism has shown from the beginning an open, flexible, and inclusive character; it contrasts sharply with the possessiveness and exclusiveness of both Christianity and Islam. As a matter of fact, this is also generally true of all other Chinese religions, including Daoism and the various sinified sects of Buddhism. This important fact perhaps explains, at least partly, why religious wars were virtually unknown in Chinese history. Almost without exception, modern historians of Chinese religion assure us that Chinese religious life is characterized, above all, by a syncretic outlook, with religious tolerance as a central built-in feature. Historically speaking, religious syncretism reached its peak in Ming China (1368&ndash;1644). Ming Taizu <span>明</span><span>太</span><span>祖</span>, the founding emperor (r. 1368&ndash;1398), openly espoused harmony and mutual complementarity of the Three Teachings&mdash;Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism&mdash;thereby setting the tone for religious syncretism during the entire Ming Period. The greatest influence on syncretism, however, came from the leading philosopher, Wang Yangming <span>王</span><span>陽</span><span>明</span> (1472&ndash;1529), who initiated a Confucian discourse on the unity of the Three Teachings. He was probably the first major Confucian thinker in Chinese history to admit that each of the Three Teachings captures a partial vision of the same <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> (Way). As a consequence, his followers in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries developed this syncretic outlook in different directions.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-245" id="calibre_link-281" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It was in a religious atmosphere marked by pervasive syncretism that Jesuit missionaries came to China. The culturally sensitive Matteo Ricci (1552&ndash;1610), who arrived in China in 1584, was very quick to discover the prevailing syncretism among the Confucian elite. He wrote:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1053" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The most common opinion today amongst those who believe themselves to be the most wise is to say that these three sects [i.e., the Three Teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism] are one and the same thing and all be observed at once. By this they deceive themselves and others, too, creating the greatest confusion, for it seems to them that, where religion is concerned, the more ways there are of putting things, the better for the kingdom.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-246" id="calibre_link-282" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Needless to say, from his exclusivist Christian point of view, syncretism was unacceptable because it was “a betrayal of principle” or “an attempt to secure unity at the expense of truth.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-247" id="calibre_link-283" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Ironically, however, it was largely syncretism that accounted for the early success of the Jesuits’ work in China. One of Ricci’s crowning achievements was undoubtedly his conversion of many leading members of the Confucian elite. Among them were Xu Guangqi <span>徐</span><span>光</span><span>啓</span> (1562&ndash;1633) and Li Zhizao <span>李</span><span>之</span><span>藻</span> (1565&ndash;1630), who, together with Yang Tingyun <span>楊</span><span>廷</span><span>筠</span> (1557&ndash;1627), were collectively known as the “three pillars of evangelization.” However, the interesting fact is that Chinese converts among the Confucian elite “were expecting to operate a kind of synthesis with Christianity itself.” What Xu was advocating “was not the pure Christian doctrine, but an amalgamation of Confucianism and Christianity similar to that which had emerged in the sixteenth century between Confucianism and Buddhism.” In the case of Yang Tingyun, he wanted to enlarge the Chinese syncretic framework to include Christianity in order to establish the “unity of Four Teachings.” According to Father Niccolo Longobardo (1559&ndash;1654), Yang Tingyun really believed that the universal principles underlying all three Chinese teachings were in agreement with the Christian “Holy Law.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-248" id="calibre_link-284" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It is also highly interesting to note that both Jesuit missionaries and Chinese converts made common efforts to prove that ancient Chinese ideas in the Confucian classics coincided with those of the Bible. For their part, the Jesuits were persuaded that such terms as <i class="calibre9">Shangdi</i> <span>上</span><span>帝</span> (Lord on High) and <i class="calibre9">Tian</i> <span>天</span> (Heaven) in Confucian texts must be references to the Christian god. They even speculated that the Chinese in very early times must somehow have already known about the God of the Bible. Even as late as 1704, the Jesuit Joachim Bouvet (1656&ndash;1730) still insisted that the Confucian classics contained “a mysterious and prophetic summary of all the principles and of the whole economy of the Christian religion and nothing else.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-249" id="calibre_link-285" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>On the other hand, Chinese converts seem to have been less concerned about the absoluteness and exclusiveness of the Christian Truth than about the Confucian emphasis on the sameness of the human mind and the universal accessibility of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> to everyone. This Confucian faith is most vividly expressed by the twelfth-century Confucian philosopher Lu Xiangshan <span>陸</span><span>象</span><span>山</span> (1139&ndash;1193):</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1190" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>If in the Eastern Sea there were to appear a sage, he would have this same mind and this same Principle (<i class="calibre9">li</i> <span>理</span>). If in the Western Sea there were to appear a sage, he would have this same mind and this same Principle. If in the Southern and Northern Seas there were to appear sages, they too would have this same mind and this same Principle. If a hundred or a thousand generations ago, or a hundred or a thousand generations hence, sages were to appear, they likewise would have this same mind and this same Principle.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-250" id="calibre_link-286" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Whatever the original intention of this statement, it has since then suggested to Confucians that neither Confucianism nor China could have an exclusive claim to the true Way. Indeed, this common understanding probably made it easier for many members of the Confucian elite to be converted to Christianity in the seventeenth century. Li Zhizao, for instance, showed his admiration for Matteo Ricci by paraphrasing Lu Xiangshan, saying, “There are the same minds and the same principles in Eastern and Western seas.” This may well be understood as an important reason why he finally accepted the religious faith of the sage from the Western Sea.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-251" id="calibre_link-287" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>I have chosen the Jesuit mission to China in the late Ming and the early Qing (1644&ndash;1911) dynasties to illustrate my point because, unlike in the late Qing, Christianity and commerce remained largely separate. Therefore, it can give us a clearer idea with regard to the Confucian response to Christianity in more purely religious terms. The relationship can by no means be described as a conflictual one. In the first six or seven decades, Chinese Confucians and European missionaries generally accommodated each other, resulting in a basic convergence between Confucian and Christian ideas. The final break between the papacy and the Qing court in 1724 involved many factors that do not concern us here. As far as religion itself was concerned, the break became inevitable only when the papacy abandoned the early accommodation policy of Ricci and took an exclusivist approach. Confucianism, by all accounts, played no significant role in it.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-252" id="calibre_link-288" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">SCIENCE</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1228" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Confucian response to Western science has always been positive and enthusiastic. China’s earliest systematic exposure to Western science also occurred in the seventeenth century. As is widely known, it was the Jesuits’ strategy to use their scientific knowledge, particularly of astronomy and mathematics, to attract Chinese interest in the Christian faith. Though living and working in the age of the Scientific Revolution in the West, the Jesuits refrained, for theological reasons, from transmitting some of the most spectacular new discoveries to the Chinese world of learning, notably Copernicus’s heliocentrism. Nevertheless, the total body of scientific knowledge they brought to China, despite its limitations, was rich enough to create a revolutionary impact on Chinese scientists.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-253" id="calibre_link-289" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> According to Nathan Sivin, Wang Xishan <span>王</span><span>錫</span><span>闡</span> (1628&ndash;1682), Mei Wending <span>梅</span><span>文</span><span>鼎</span> (1633&ndash;1721), and Xue Fengzuo <span>薛</span><span>鳳</span><span>祚</span> (d. 1680), the first scholars in China to respond to Western science were “responsible for a scientific revolution” in China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-254" id="calibre_link-290" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The introduction of Western science also affected the development of Confucian learning in important ways. One was a growing emphasis on the importance of knowledge of the external world. Here we may take Fang Yizhi’s <span>方</span><span>以</span><span>智</span> (1611&ndash;1671) redefinition of the Confucian concept of <i class="calibre9">gewu</i> <span>格</span><span>物</span> (investigation of things) as an example. He was greatly fascinated by Western astronomy, mathematics, physiology, and natural philosophy as he found them in the books published by the Jesuits. Having critically examined and carefully compared them with their Chinese counterparts, he became convinced that investigation of physical objects in the external world had been an important part of sagely learning in ancient China, which had contributed enormously to humans’ physical well-being. As a result, he gave the concept <i class="calibre9">gewu</i> an interpretation diametrically opposite to the one offered by Wang Yangming that had dominated Confucian thinking since the sixteenth century. Wang took <i class="calibre9">wu</i> to be “things within our minds,” not “things in the external world,” which he dismissed as irrelevant to moral cultivation. On his part, Fang not only extended the concept of <i class="calibre9">wu</i> to include “things” external to our minds but, more specifically and emphatically, “things” in the natural world. Consequently, he also understood the Confucian notion of <i class="calibre9">li</i> <span>理</span> (principle) differently. <i class="calibre9">Li</i> for him refers not only to “moral principles” but “principles of things” (<i class="calibre9">wuli</i> <span>物</span><span>理</span>) as well. Among his writings are a series of studies on the structure of the universe (astronomy) and on the human body (physiology). This was clearly impossible without the help of the scientific literature provided by the Jesuits.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-255" id="calibre_link-291" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The extremely favorable response from leading scholars such as Fang did much to redirect the attention of scholars of younger generations to mathematical and scientific studies, among whom were Wang Xishan, Mei Wending, and Fang’s second son, Fang Zhongtong <span>方</span><span>中</span><span>通</span>. Throughout the Qing Period, we find indigenous scientific tradition carried on in China continuously. Rediscovery and critical examination of ancient works of mathematics, science, and technology formed an important part of Confucian classical scholarship in the eighteenth century. Some of the leading classicists, including Dai Zhen <span>戴</span><span>震</span> (1724&ndash;1777) and Qian Daxin, <span>錢</span><span>大</span><span>昕</span> (1728&ndash;1804), were also first-rate mathematicians. Confucian scholars continued to study Western mathematics and science. In 1799, Ruan Yuan <span>阮</span><span>元</span> (1764&ndash;1849) compiled, with the help of Qian and others, a collection of biographies of 280 astronomers and mathematicians, among them thirty-seven Europeans. He also shared the view with many others that mathematics and science must be made a component part of Confucian training.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1181" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Confucian response to Western science, early and late, serves particularly well as a caution that we must not blindly trust the sweeping generalization about so-called Sinocentrism, as Huntington apparently does (234&ndash;235). Contrary to conventional wisdom, “Sinic civilization” has been remarkably open to foreign influence. Had it been the Chinese propensity to reject things and ideas on the grounds of pure outlandishness, Buddhism would have had no chance at all to become one of China’s Three Teachings. Fang Yizhi justified his acceptance of certain Western scientific theories by citing the example of Confucius as his defense. Even a sage like Confucius did not hesitate to learn from a “foreigner” who knew something about “birds.” Eighteenth-century Confucians often expressed their great admiration for Western science, which, they openly admitted, was superior to its Chinese counterpart. Ji Yun <span>紀</span><span>昀</span> (1724&ndash;1804), general editor of the imperial project known as <i class="calibre9">Siku quanshu</i> <span>四</span><span>庫</span><span>全</span><span>書</span> (The Complete Library of the Four Treasures), said in no uncertain terms that the West far surpassed China in mathematics, astronomy, water control, weaponry, etc.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-256" id="calibre_link-292" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup> A comparison between Western science and its Chinese counterpart also led Qian Daxin to come to the same conclusion. Then he went on to explain why this had been the case:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>It is not possible that the ingenuity of Europeans surpasses that of China. It is only that Europeans have transmitted [their findings] systematically from father to son and from master to disciple for generations. Hence, after a long period [of progress] their knowledge has become increasingly precise. Confucian scholars have, on the other hand, usually denigrated those who were good mathematicians as petty technicians…. In ancient times, no one could be a Confucian who did not know mathematics…. Chinese methods [now] lag behind Europe’s because Confucians do not know mathematics.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-257" id="calibre_link-293" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Here Qian Daxin obviously took Europe to be a civilization comparable to China. In the earlier part of the above-quoted essay, he also repeated Lu Xiangshan’s statement that “there are the same minds and the same principles in Eastern and Western seas,” but added that “there is also the same number” referring, in his case, to the universality of mathematical knowledge. Confucian universalism is not necessarily Sinocentric.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1265" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>This continuing presence of Western science in Confucian consciousness throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had much to do with the response of the Chinese intellectual elite to the crisis of Western invasion in the post&ndash;Opium War period. Leading Confucian scholars concerned about China’s “self-strengthening” immediately focused their attention on the promotion of Western science as a matter of utmost urgency. Feng Guifen <span>馮</span><span>桂</span><span>芬</span> (1809&ndash;1874), who first served as an assistant to Commissioner Lin Zexu <span>林</span><span>則</span><span>徐</span> and later as secretary to Li Hongzhang <span>李</span><span>鴻</span><span>章</span>, wrote a highly influential essay in 1860 advocating “adoption of Western knowledge.” By this term, he meant primarily Western science. Trained in Confucian classics as well as in mathematics, astronomy, and geography, he clearly recognized science as the source of Western power. In his opinion, “Western books (in Chinese translation) on mathematics, mechanics, optics, light, chemistry and other subjects contain the best principles of the natural sciences”; it is also remarkable that he emphasized the central importance of mathematics in the early scientific training of students.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-258" id="calibre_link-294" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> From this time on, Western science was steadily moving toward the center of the Chinese educational system until it eventually replaced Confucian classics in the early decades of the twentieth century. Chinese worship of science reached its first peak during the May Fourth era when the idea was personified to become “Mr. Science.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-259" id="calibre_link-295" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">DEMOCRACY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Democracy is actually the core area of Huntington’s grand theory. In his 1991 article, “Religion and the Third Wave,” he suggests a causal relationship between Christianity and democracy that anticipates the theory of a “clash of civilizations.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-260" id="calibre_link-296" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> In <i class="calibre9">The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order</i>, his view on this subject remains substantially unchanged. He writes:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>During the 1970s and 1980s over thirty countries shifted from authoritarian to democratic political systems…. Democratization was most successful in countries where Christian and Western influences were strong. New democratic regimes appeared most likely to stabilize in the Southern and Central European countries that were predominantly Catholic or Protestant and, less certainly, in Latin American countries. In East Asia, the Catholic and heavily American influenced Philippines returned to democracy in the 1980s, while Christian leaders promoted movement toward democracy in South Korea and Taiwan…. [I]n the former Soviet Union, the Baltic republics appear to be successfully stabilizing democracy; the degree and stability of democracy in the Orthodox republics vary considerably and are uncertain; democratic prospects in the Muslim republics are bleak. By the 1990s, except for Cuba, democratic transitions had occurred in most of the countries, outside Africa, whose peoples espoused Western Christianity or where major Christian influences existed. (192&ndash;193)</span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1184" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As far as democratization is concerned, Huntington’s view of both Confucianism and Islam has been consistently negative. This perhaps explains why he thinks democratic prospects in the Muslim republics of the former Soviet Union “are bleak” on the one hand and attributes movements toward democracy in South Korea and Taiwan in the 1980s to the promotion of “Christian leaders” on the other. I cannot pretend to know anything about the Muslim republics and South Korea mentioned here. As far as my knowledge goes, however, Christianity does not seem to have played any significant role in the recent democratization of Taiwan. Once again, he is interpreting the facts at will to suit his theory.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In <i class="calibre9">The Third Wave</i> (1991), Huntington offers a brief critical discussion of “Confucianism” based on the received view in the West that “traditional Confucianism was either undemocratic or antidemocratic.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-261" id="calibre_link-297" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> He seems to be very confident in reaching an overall conclusion that “In practice Confucian and Confucian-influenced societies have been inhospitable to democracy.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-262" id="calibre_link-298" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup> To be fair to Huntington, he does not say that Confucian culture is a permanent barrier to democracy. Moreover, he even allows the possibility that Confucianism may also have “some elements that are compatible with democracy, just as both Protestantism and Catholicism have elements that are clearly undemocratic.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-263" id="calibre_link-299" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> In the end, however, he is unswerving in his belief that “China’s Confucian heritage, with its emphasis on authority, order, hierarchy and the supremacy of the collectivity over the individual, creates obstacles to democratization” (238).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Needless to say, this is not the place to engage in a comprehensive and detailed debate with Huntington on the nature of Confucianism and its changing political and social ideas over the past twenty-five centuries. For the sake of brevity, allow me to ask a very simple historical question: Given the supposedly inherent hostility of Confucianism to Western values associated with democracy, who were those Chinese first attracted to the very idea of democracy? Even a casual examination of the historical record will show that the earliest Chinese discoverers and advocates of democracy in the late nineteenth century were none other than the reform-minded Confucians. Wang Tao <span>王</span><span>韜</span> (1828&ndash;1897), Guo Songtao <span>郭</span><span>嵩</span><span>燾</span> (1818&ndash;1891), and Xue Fucheng <span>薛</span><span>福</span><span>成</span> (1838&ndash;1894), for example, all returned from their respective years-long trips to Europe deeply impressed by the democratic ideals and institutions of the West. Wang and Xue, independently of each other, praised England and America in terms of the Golden Age in China’s high antiquity. Wang Tao was probably the first Chinese scholar who identified three forms of state in Europe, which he called, respectively, <i class="calibre9">minzhu</i> <span>民</span><span>主</span>, or democracy; <i class="calibre9">junzhu</i> <span>君</span><span>主</span>, or monarchy; and <i class="calibre9">junmin gongzhu</i> <span>君</span><span>民</span><span>共</span><span>主</span>, or constitutional monarchy.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-264" id="calibre_link-300" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1094" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>At the turn of the century, there were two rival Confucian schools in China. The New Text school claimed Kang Youwei <span>康</span><span>有</span><span>為</span> (1858&ndash;1927), Tan Sitong <span>譚</span><span>嗣</span><span>同</span> (1865&ndash;1898), and Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1868&ndash;1936) as its leaders; the Old Text school was led by Zhang Binglin <span>章</span><span>炳</span><span>麟</span> (1868&ndash;1936) and Liu Shipei <span>劉</span><span>師</span><span>培</span> (1884&ndash;1919). It is interesting to note that both schools advocated democracy, though each in its own way. The New Text Confucians were reformists in favor of constitutional monarchy while their Old Text rivals became revolutionaries pushing for republicanism. What is particularly remarkable about the two groups is that they shared the very same interest in searching for the origins and evolution of democratic ideas in the Confucian past. Kang Youwei was the first late Qing scholar to carry out such a project. Inspired by Wang Tao’s writings, he divided Chinese history into three periods. He deemed the highest and most perfect form of government to be the “democracy” of the time of the legendary sage-emperors Yao and Shun; the second best form of government was “constitutional monarchy” in the early Zhou; and the worst form of government was the “autocracy” in place since the unification of China in 221 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small> Through an extensive exegesis of certain Confucian texts, he concluded, finally, that Confucius was a most enthusiastic advocate of democracy in ancient China.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-265" id="calibre_link-301" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup> We can easily dismiss this whole exercise as sheer nonsense. Nonetheless, it is extremely valuable as evidence showing the extraordinary enthusiasm with which Confucians responded to the Western idea of democracy in this early stage. Thus, Kang Youwei set an example to be followed not only by his disciples but by his rivals as well. Liu Shipei, for instance, wrote a book entitled <i class="calibre9">Zhongguo minyue jingyi</i> <span>中</span><span>國</span><span>民</span><span>約</span><span>精</span><span>義</span> (Essentials of the Chinese Theory of Social Contract),<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-266" id="calibre_link-302" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> which purports to trace the development of such ideas as democracy, freedom, rights, etc., throughout Chinese history.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>During the May Fourth era, antitraditionalism reigned supreme and democracy and Confucianism were viewed as antithetical to each other, a view that has now also been widely accepted in the West. However, if we examine more closely the writings of the two May Fourth leaders largely responsible for the dissemination of this view, Chen Duxiu <span>陳</span><span>獨</span><span>秀</span> (1879&ndash;1942) and Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962), we see that the matter is rather complicated. Both men received classical educations in their early years and remained to the end of their lives committed to certain Confucian values. Chen made the following remark from his prison cell in the early 1930s:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>Every feudal dynasty worshipped Confucius as a sage. The act of worship was inauthentic. Its true purpose was to strengthen dynastic rule…. This is the reason that during the May Fourth Movement we came up with the slogan “Down with Confucius and Sons.” However, intellectually speaking, the sayings of Confucius and Mencius are worth studying. Statements such as “The People are of supreme importance, and the sovereign comes last” (Mencius) and “In teaching, there should be no distinction of classes” (Confucius) all deserve to be further explored.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-267" id="calibre_link-303" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1189" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It may be noted that by this time Chen had already been expelled from the Chinese Communist Party of which he was the founder. It is very revealing that he now not only had his second thoughts about Confucian culture but also reembraced Western democracy, which he had repudiated during his Communist period. On the other hand, Hu Shi as a moderate liberal never wholly abandoned some of the Confucian values that constituted the core of what he called “the humanistic and rationalistic China.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-268" id="calibre_link-304" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> In many of his English writings, he often emphasized the compatibility of Confucianism with Western liberalism and suggested that certain Confucian ideas and institutions might prove to be capable of furnishing China with a solid foundation on which constitutional democracy could be successfully established.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-269" id="calibre_link-305" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The above historical sketch clearly shows that the idea of democracy found its most sympathetic audience in China among the Confucian elites. By contrast, other social groups, including merchants and peasants, were generally not motivated enough to be actively involved in politics, social responsibility, human equality, the well-being of the people, etc., which are some of the closest Confucian equivalents to Western civic virtues. It was this Confucian “civic” spirit that disposed many Chinese intellectuals to Western democratic ideas at the turn of the century. This may smack of elitism today. However, it is elitism in the best sense of the word. I heartily agree with Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who says: “Of all the cants in this canting world, the cant about elitism is the most futile. Government throughout human history has always been government by minority&mdash;that is, by elites. This is as true for democratic and communist states today as it was for medieval monarchies and primitive tribes…. The serious question is not the existence of the ruling elite but their character.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-270" id="calibre_link-306" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> To give a most recent example, the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989 was to a large extent related to the partial revival of elite culture in post-Mao China. Commenting on this tragic event, Michael Walzer suggests that student elitism was probably rooted in “pre-Communist cultural traditions specific to China.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-271" id="calibre_link-307" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup> I believe he is right.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If I may borrow a new concept recently developed by John Rawls, I would like to think that Confucianism will do well as one of the “reasonable comprehensive doctrines” that forms part of the “background culture” of a constitutional democratic regime. Since democracy cannot flourish in a culturally impoverished land, a high level of elite culture is a precondition for the initial success of democratization.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-272" id="calibre_link-308" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> As beautifully expressed by Vaclav Havel: “In the moral world of antiquity, Judaism, and Christianity, without which the West would hardly have come to modern democracy, we can find more points of agreement with Confucius than we would think, and more than is realized by those who invoke the Confucian tradition to condemn Western democracy.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-273" id="calibre_link-309" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup> I only wish to add that it is equally unwise to invoke Western democracy to condemn the Confucian tradition.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">CONCLUSION</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1015" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Religion, science, and political systems are the three key areas in which a “clash of civilizations” are most likely to occur. The brief review above, however, shows that Confucian responses to the challenge of Western civilization in all these three areas have been, by and large, very positive. From the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries, Confucians actively sought to incorporate what they considered to be the quintessence of Western culture into their own civilization without losing its identity altogether. This attitude is best expressed in Hu Shi’s introduction to <i class="calibre9">The Development of the Logical Method in Ancient China</i>, written before he became an ardent advocate of “total Westernization.” He wrote:</span></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="noindent"><span>How can we Chinese feel at ease in this new world which at first light appears to be so much at variance with what we have long regarded as our own civilization? For it is perfectly natural and justifiable that a nation with a glorious past and a distinctive civilization of its own making should never feel quite at home in a new civilization, if that new civilization is looked upon as part and parcel imported from alien lands and forced upon it by external necessities of national existence. And it would surely be a great loss to mankind at large if the acceptance of this new civilization should take the form of abrupt displacement instead of organic assimilation, thereby causing the disappearance of the old civilization. The real problem, therefore, may be stated thus: How can we best assimilate modern civilization in such a manner as to make it congenial and congruous and continuous with the civilization of our own making?<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-274" id="calibre_link-310" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="noindent"><span>Of the three elements discussed above, science and democracy, in particular, have been accepted by Confucians as essential to the rebirth of Chinese civilization in the modern world. Contrary to the conventional assumption, science and democracy are not promoted only by Westernized antitraditionalists in China. Liang Shuming <span>梁</span><span>漱</span><span>溟</span> (1893&ndash;1988), now known as a leading New Confucianist in twentieth-century China, was famous for his systematic exposition of the incompatibility between Chinese civilization and Western civilization during the May Fourth Period. Nevertheless, he admonished in earnest that the Chinese must take an “attitude of ‘complete acceptance’ of Western culture…. The two spirits [of science and democracy] are completely correct. We must accept them unconditionally. The urgent task facing us today is [to know] just how to introduce [them effectively].”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-275" id="calibre_link-311" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup> What is widely known today as New Confucianism was born in Hong Kong in 1958 when four Confucian scholars published “A Manifesto to the World on Chinese Culture.” As rightly observed by Hao Chang, its authors tend to “interpret the Chinese intellectual heritage in ways that could accommodate modern Western values such as democracy and science”; it is the belief of these four New Confucianists that the basic Confucian value orientation, when understood broadly and in perspective, “would dispose the Chinese toward accepting Western science and democracy.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-276" id="calibre_link-312" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup> It is this New Confucianism that has been most sympathetically received by a new generation of intellectuals in mainland China since the 1980s.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2496" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It is rather unfortunate that Huntington speculates a great deal about the prospect of a clash between Chinese and Western civilizations without a basic historical grasp of the developments of Confucianism in modern and contemporary China. He seems to rely heavily on Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore as the sole authoritative interpreter of Confucianism, who, as Havel says, takes great interest in the Confucian tradition only to invoke it to condemn Western democracy. I do not deny that a deep-seated antagonism does seem to exist between the regime in Beijing and the West. However, the source of this antagonism clearly lies elsewhere. It is only fair that Confucian culture be absolved of all blame.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2499" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><span class="dropcap">I</span> deeply appreciate the great honor of being asked to speak before this distinguished assembly of historians of Asia. I must confess, however, that I accepted this important assignment not entirely without hesitation. I hesitated because I was not quite sure that I could find things to say that might interest all of you. By professional training, I am only a tender of the small garden of early Chinese history and wholly ignorant of other vineyards of Asian history in which many of you have productively labored. It seems that the only way for my speech to make some sense on this particular occasion is that I must speak not only as a historian of China but also as a historian-at-large, if that is possible at all.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As I understand it, the general theme of this conference is “Tradition and Development,” which in many ways provides me with an ideal opportunity for some reflecting on my lifelong quest for a true understanding of the Chinese cultural tradition and its place in world history. I offer my apologies if my reflections occasionally turn out to be somewhat autobiographical. But I hope in the end that what I am going to say might have some relevance to the historical inquiry of cultural traditions in the non-Western (in this case, the Asian) nations as a whole.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">1</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1073" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the past two decades or so, some of the most fundamental assumptions of our historical discipline have been called into serious question. As a result, there is neither a dominant paradigm nor any consensus about what constitutes the normal practice in historical studies. In Clio’s temple, it appears, hierarchy has given way to anarchy and order to chaos. If philosophers nowadays can only define their trade as “whatever we philosophy professors do,”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-673" id="calibre_link-715" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">1</a></small></sup> then we can also say that “history as an academic discipline consists in whatever the historians are doing.” At any rate, it is obvious that historians today are united only by a common concern with the past, but little else. Recently, the current state of historical scholarship was most vividly described in the last verse of the Book of Judges: “In those days, there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-674" id="calibre_link-716" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">2</a></small></sup> As a Chinese reader, this description reminded me immediately of the famous saying in the <i class="calibre9">Yijing</i> (Classic of Changes): “A flock of dragons without a leader.” This is, however, considered an auspicious sign in the divination text.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Now, we must ask: Who was the “king” that had last occupied the throne of the kingdom of history? Under what circumstances did this last king somehow get himself dethroned? I believe this last king can be broadly identified as the positivistic conception of history. His royal genealogy is a long one that is traceable ultimately to Enlightenment notions of reason, tradition, human nature, progress, etc., but it was particularly during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that his dynasty reigned triumphant.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Over the centuries, historical positivism has outgrown its early crudity and developed into something profoundly subtle and complex, often taking unexpected turns as well as assuming variegated forms. It is therefore impossible for me to attempt a sketch of the doctrine here even in its barest essentials. To give you a general idea about some of the significant changes in recent historical thinking, however, I would like to call your attention specifically to those interrelated elements of historical positivism that are being most critically reexamined in recent years.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>First, central to the positivistic conception is the notion that history as a discipline must remain a scientific enterprise. It is indeed true that the nineteenth-century belief in the possibility of a natural science of history modeled on, if not physics, at any rate the biological sciences had long been abandoned. No historian today, in the West anyway, would take seriously J. B. Bury’s catchword that “history is a science, no less and no more.” As late as the 1960s and the early 1970s, however, history was generally identified as a social science with a growing emphasis on quantification. As one distinguished <i class="calibre9">Annales</i> historian put it, “history that is not quantifiable cannot claim to be scientific.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-675" id="calibre_link-717" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">3</a></small></sup> This brief statement testifies fully to the fact that the ideal of “scientific history” was still greatly cherished even though the very conception of “science” may have undergone drastic changes.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1081" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Second, if history is social science, then it must of necessity share all the basic assumptions on which rest the idea of the objectivity of scientific knowledge, for mainstream social scientists are generally convinced that their discipline is on the secure path of becoming a genuine natural science. In the case of historical objectivity, however, Ranke’s notion that the past be shown “as it really was” has been taken as its classical expression. Due to the unique nature of historical evidence, which cannot be produced under direct observation, many historians are willing to admit that history as a scientific discipline must always remain a highly inexact one. Nevertheless, it is still a science as long as it follows the same scientific methods, procedures, and criteria for testing hypotheses and theories. This perhaps explains why historical positivism has always been predicated on the correspondence theory of truth, which is also generally implied in the positivist conception of science. As a matter of fact, the objective-subjective distinction in history itself presupposes that there is a reality of the past to which truth is correspondence. Moreover, truth is one, not relative to historian’s perspectives. The historian’s business is to discover objective historical facts and then establish hypotheses or theories to account for his facts. It is the underlying faith of the historical positivist that the discipline of history will progress with every new discovery of objective facts, just as science does; each generation’s revision of the past would be an improvement.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Third, another important aspect of the positivist program is the transformation of history into a natural science by establishing universal laws of social evolution that will enable us to predict the future and retrodict the past. The first systematic attempt was made by Auguste Comte, the founder of positivism, in the early nineteenth century, even though his “law of the three periods”&mdash;theological-metaphysical-positive&mdash;is now totally forgotten. By the late nineteenth century, however, evolutionary ideas under the impact of Darwin and Spencer further strengthened the positivist search for laws in history. In this connection, I must also mention Marx’s contribution. The Marxist five-stage theory of history is a much more powerful formulation than Comte’s “law of the three periods.” It may well have been the case that Marx originally did not intend his generalizations based on historical experiences of Western Europe to be taken as universal laws in history.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-676" id="calibre_link-718" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">4</a></small></sup> But it is also undeniable that Marx’s own language sometimes does suggest that he believed he had discovered “laws” that govern social change. Thus, in 1867, he spoke with great confidence of “the natural laws of capitalist production…working with iron necessity towards inevitable results.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-677" id="calibre_link-719" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">5</a></small></sup> At any rate, since Stalin’s time, the five-stage theory of history has been firmly established in orthodox Marxism as a uniform pattern of development for all societies. Moreover, during the 1970s, this theory was also reiterated by a number of European Marxist historians in their discussions of the transition from feudalism to capitalism.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-678" id="calibre_link-720" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">6</a></small></sup> This belief in the possibility of a universal historical model, it may be emphatically noted, has had a considerable influence on Asian historians’ treatment of their own national histories, especially in China and Japan.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2500" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Fourth, economies and social determinism comprise the last element in historical positivism that merits mention here. The origin of this type of determinism, as we all know, can be traced to the distinction between base and superstructure in Marxism. But the notion “social being determines consciousness” as a general assumption has somehow found its way into practically every field of modern historical and social inquiry. It goes extremely well with the reductive mode of thinking, a salient feature of positivism. For example, assertions about mental events are reducible to facts about behavior according to some philosophers, or, as some behaviorist psychologists believe, human behavior can be reduced to that of lower animals, which, in turn, can itself be reduced ultimately to the physical laws governing the behavior of inanimate matter. In fact, determinism and reductionism are two sides of the same coin. In the discipline of history, the two decades of the 1960s and 1970s witnessed a rapid growth of social history at the expense of intellectual and, especially, political history in the United States. Between 1958 and 1978, the percentage of American doctoral dissertations in social history quadrupled.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-679" id="calibre_link-721" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">7</a></small></sup> This move toward social historical research was, to a great extent, influenced by the new trend to write “history from below” advocated by European Marxist historians and the French Annales school in the 1960s. The latter, under the guiding spirit of Braudel, distinguished three “levels” in history. The first level was the infrastructure consisting of material forces of climate, biology, demography, and economy that operated as the prime movers of the historical process; the next level was the structure of long-enduring social relationships; the last was the superstructure of political, cultural, and intellectual life. This is clearly a slightly modified and expanded version of the Marxist model of base and superstructure. It must be pointed out, however, that by the end of the 1970s, this deterministic model had already become totally discredited. As a noted social historian wrote in 1979: “Models of historical determinism based on economies, demography or sociology have collapsed in the face of the evidence, but no full blown deterministic model based on any other social science&mdash;politics, psychology or anthropology&mdash;has emerged to take its place.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-680" id="calibre_link-722" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">8</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">2</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1054" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Each of the four elements in historical positivism discussed above has been separately disputed over the years, some earlier than others. What is more significant, however, is that in the last decade or so, historical positivism as a whole, in its insistence on identifying history as a scientific enterprise based by and large on the correspondence theory of truth, has been seriously challenged, if not undermined. The challenge comes not only internally from history itself but also from other disciplines on which history is now largely parasitical. Needless to say, the whole story about this reorientation of historical studies is too complicated to be told here. What I propose to do below is, first, to indicate a new direction in which the discipline of history seems to have been moving during the past decade as historical positivism has been gradually but surely ebbing. Then I shall discuss this reorientation in the context of parallel developments in other related fields.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Writing in 1983, a keen observer of current trends in historiography remarked, “Most recently there has been a turn away from a hard social-scientific approach to a pronounced concern with intangible factors of culture and consciousness.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-681" id="calibre_link-723" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">9</a></small></sup> This observation is now further confirmed by the editor of a collection of historical studies on culture under the title <i class="calibre9">The New Cultural History</i> (1989). The editor, Lynn Hunt, tells us more specifically that models of historical explanation have been undergoing a major shift in emphasis as both Marxists and Annalists have been moving from social history to cultural history in recent years.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-682" id="calibre_link-724" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">10</a></small></sup> We may take some Annales historians as illustrative examples. According to Michel Vovelle, a third-generation Annalist, between 1960 and 1980, several members of the school moved from the “cellar” (social structures) to the “loft” (cultural superstructure such as “mentalities”) as a reaction against the social and economic determinism of Braudel.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-683" id="calibre_link-725" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">11</a></small></sup> Fourth-generation Annales historians such as Roger Chartier are even more radical in their revolt against historical determinism; Chartier deems Braudel’s three-level theory no longer admissible. Instead, he proposes to view what he calls “cultural structure” and “social structure” as equally primary determinants of historical reality.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-684" id="calibre_link-726" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">12</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The move toward the cultural has been made not only by social historians but by intellectual historians as well. At the Wingspread Conference on New Directions in American Intellectual History held in Racine, Wisconsin, in December 1977, one of the clear tendencies was the redefinition of intellectual history in terms of cultures as structures of meanings. Drawing on the work of some interpretive sociologists and anthropologists, intellectual historians now extend what they call “ideas” to include meanings inherent in human behavior. As a human person gives meaning to everything he or she does, social action must be seen as being determined by meanings. Redefined in this way, intellectual history is inseparable from social history. It is therefore groundless to say that the latter is at the center while the former is on the periphery of the historical profession. “For the meanings of man’s action,” says Gordon S. Wood, “form the very structure of his social world.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-685" id="calibre_link-727" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">13</a></small></sup> It is also significant that one-third of the Wingspread Conference papers fell into the category of “History of Culture.” In 1980, a leading intellectual historian, William J. Bouwsma, perceptively characterized this shift as being “From [the] History of Ideas to [the] History of Meaning.” According to him, the increasing tendency of historians to substitute the word “cultural” in places they might earlier have employed the word “intellectual” has resulted mainly from the association of “culture” with meaning in a large sense.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-686" id="calibre_link-728" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">14</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1046" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The rise of the new cultural history has another important implication, namely, the recognition of the plurality of cultures. The very conception of the cultural autonomy of different societies, whether divided by space or time, serves well to undermine that tacit assumption of a West-centered universalism since the Enlightenment. Isaiah Berlin’s repeated celebration of Vico and Herder as the founding fathers of cultural history is clearly a plea for seeing cultures of different historical stages as well as of different nations in their own terms. What is particularly remarkable about both thinkers is, Berlin suggests, the realization on their part that “cultures are many and various, each embodying scales of value different from those of other cultures and sometimes incompatible with them, yet capable of being understood, that is, seen by observers endowed with sufficiently acute and sympathetic historical insight, as ways of living which human beings could pursue and remain fully human.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-687" id="calibre_link-729" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">15</a></small></sup> In this connection, however, I must point out that what Berlin calls “acute and sympathetic historical insight” is actually a reference to what is generally known as “empathetic understanding,” which is central to hermeneutics but dismissed as nonsense by positivists of all persuasions. Now let us move on to the hermeneutic challenge to positivism and its bearing on Clio’s cultural turn in recent years.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>There can be little doubt that hermeneutics is the single most important intellectual force behind the search for meanings in contemporary cultural studies. In the English-speaking academic world, however, the term “hermeneutics” has gained currency only very recently. I remember when I read R. G. Collingwood’s <i class="calibre9">The Idea of History</i> for the first time in 1955, I was greatly fascinated by many of its eye-opening pages about the unique nature of historical knowledge. Ideas such as “the outside and inside of an event” and historical knowing as “reenactment of past thought” then suggested to me a move toward a more reasonable and convincing way of explaining the human past than the “covering law model” of Carl G. Hempel, which was, however, the order of the day. The internal difficulties involved in Collingwood’s theory of “empathetic understanding” were extensively discussed by critical philosophers of history during the 1950s, who often linked Collingwood to Dilthey, Croce, and the European tradition of <i class="calibre9">Geistwissenschaften</i>. The term “hermeneutics” was not even mentioned in these discussions, however. It was not until the 1970s when works by Paul Ricoeur, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and a host of other European hermeneutists began to invade not only the humanities but also social sciences in the United States that the hermeneutic approach obtained full respectability as an alternative to the positivist program. A quarter of a century later, I was greatly delighted to see Collingwood treated with respect and understanding in Gadamer’s <i class="calibre9">Truth and Method</i>.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1209" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>The very starting point of hermeneutics is that human sciences&mdash;that is, <i class="calibre9">Geistwissenschaften</i>&mdash;must be distinguished from natural sciences because a human being, as diametrically opposed to a molecule in a chemical reaction, is a being with intentions and purposes. However, hermeneutics is not primarily concerned with seeking to understand the intentions and purposes of individual actors in history, as Collingwood’s “reenacting a past thought” seems to suggest. It is rather concerned with the collective mentality of a society or community. This is perhaps why Gadamer often speaks of “the fusion of horizons,” a notion that Ricoeur, too, considers very fruitful.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-688" id="calibre_link-730" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">16</a></small></sup> Whether it is called “horizon,” “structure of meaning,” “objective mind,” or some other name, it seems unmistakable that the true center of the hermeneutical enterprise is what we call “culture.” In fact, Dilthey already made it clear that the object of human studies (<i class="calibre9">Geistwissenschaften</i>) is “culture” and “meaning.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-689" id="calibre_link-731" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">17</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The impact of hermeneutics on human and social sciences as a whole has been considerable, though varying in degree from one individual discipline to another. The emergence of so-called interpretive social science, including anthropology, sociology, politics, and psychology, is an obvious result. Some disciplines in the humanities in which interpretation has always played a prominent role such as philosophy, art history, and literary criticism are now becoming more hermeneutical in analysis. This development has led to a blurring of the line separating objectivity from subjectivity; ideas and social realities imply each other. As a result, ideas can no longer be viewed as epiphenomenal. It may not have been a pure coincidence that the conception of natural science has also undergone a similar change in recent years. Thomas Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolution, for instance, transformed science into a human and historical matter subject to interpretation. Some physical scientists even find it necessary to “give up the naïve concept of reality, the idea that the world is made up of things, waiting for us to discover their nature.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-690" id="calibre_link-732" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">18</a></small></sup> New scientific insights have also caused a partial collapse of the correspondence theory of truth. The distinguished astrophysicist John A. Wheeler told us in 1982: “The universe does not exist ‘out there’ independent of us. We are inescapably involved in bringing about that which appears to be happening. We are not only observers. We are participators. In some strange sense this is a participatory universe.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-691" id="calibre_link-733" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">19</a></small></sup> These new scientific views have been developed, needless to say, independently of hermeneutics, but they have strengthened our faith in the relative autonomy of the human mind.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The relative autonomy of the mind argues for the relative autonomy of culture as the mind’s creation. It is very interesting that, according to a noted sociologist, there has been a convergence in emphasis on the autonomy of culture from social structure in recent cultural studies.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-692" id="calibre_link-734" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">20</a></small></sup> What is even more revealing is the contribution of cultural Marxism in this regard, traceable to Gramsci’s idea of “cultural hegemony.” The very fact that the masses appear to adhere voluntarily to dominant ideas of the ruling class suggests that culture is a somewhat independent force to be reckoned with. Under the influence of cultural Marxism, Marxist historians also turned, in the 1970s, to stress the decisive role of cultural factors in defining a historical situation.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-693" id="calibre_link-735" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">21</a></small></sup> Some Marxists have even carried the notion of cultural autonomy to the point of “culturalist fallacy.” The New Historicists, for instance, identify historical context as the “cultural system” and take social institutions and practices to be its functions&mdash;a complete reversal of base and superstructure in the original Marxist formulation.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-694" id="calibre_link-736" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">22</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1308" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Of all the interpretive social sciences, I wish to use the anthropology of Clifford Geertz as evidence for my argument for Clio’s cultural turn. This is justifiable on two grounds: First, history and anthropology are moving increasingly in each other’s direction in dealing with problems of cultural change. Second, Geertz is perhaps the most influential anthropologist among historians; he was described by John Higham, for instance, as “virtually the patron saint” of the Wingspread Conference on American Intellectual History, mentioned above.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Geertz has offered two well-known definitions for the concept of culture. On one occasion, he says: “Believing, with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-695" id="calibre_link-737" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">23</a></small></sup> The very way in which Geertz defines culture here shows clearly that he is determined to take the side of hermeneutics and openly break with the positivist tradition. On another occasion, he takes culture as denoting “an historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-696" id="calibre_link-738" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">24</a></small></sup> Here, it is noteworthy that the historical dimension of culture is very much emphasized. In both cases, meaning is taken to be central to culture. Elsewhere in developing an anthropological theory of religion he also takes a hermeneutic position by focusing on the problem of meaning in order to establish the autonomy of culture.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-697" id="calibre_link-739" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">25</a></small></sup> Little wonder that cultural historians often find Geertzian interpretive strategies congenial. For the search for meaning, rather than the search for laws, is taken to be also the central task of cultural history.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">3</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1303" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Culture and tradition are sometimes interchangeable in meaning. In the 1930s, the social anthropologist Robert Redfield made the observation that within some societies there are two cultural traditions that he proposed to call, respectively, the “great tradition” and the “little tradition.” According to his definition, “the great tradition is cultivated in schools or temples; the little tradition works itself out and keeps itself going in the lives of the unlettered in their village communities.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-698" id="calibre_link-740" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">26</a></small></sup> Today, both terms&mdash;“great tradition” and “little tradition”&mdash;have fallen into disuse and have been replaced by “elite culture” and “popular culture” as a result of revision and modification.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-699" id="calibre_link-741" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">27</a></small></sup> I take this to be a most obvious case showing that tradition and culture sometimes can be the same thing only viewed from different perspectives. Geertz’s conception of culture as “an historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols,” quoted above, may apply to “tradition” with equal validity. Such being the case, I propose to examine, briefly, the changing attitudes toward tradition in recent decades in the hope of throwing some further light on Clio’s cultural turn.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Unfortunately, “tradition” acquired a rather negative meaning in the twentieth century. It has been generally perceived as antithetical to all the values we associate with modernity such as reason, progress, freedom, and, especially, revolution. Historically speaking, this negative view of tradition has its origin in the Enlightenment. On the whole, Enlightenment thinkers viewed tradition&mdash;any tradition&mdash;chiefly as a hindrance to human progress. Modern positivism, especially in its extreme form of scientism, is hostile to traditions. With the possible exception of Max Weber, modern social scientists rarely touched on the topic of tradition. Weber, indeed, made tradition a major category of analysis in his political sociology, but even he “did now allow much of a place for tradition in his account of modern society.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-700" id="calibre_link-742" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">28</a></small></sup> Not until the late 1960s and the early 1970s did some social scientists of note begin to take tradition seriously and systematically as an object of study. It is very interesting that both Edward Shils and Carl J. Friedrich complained, almost simultaneously, that there had been very little monographic basis for undertaking a theoretical analysis of the idea of tradition.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-701" id="calibre_link-743" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">29</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Tradition particularly suffered during the 1950s when “modernization” was first put on the agenda of social sciences. In those early days, eradication of tradition was almost regarded as a precondition for modernization. As empirical studies of processes of modernization grew mature, however, the true value of tradition was also being slowly but surely rediscovered. In their study of the role of tradition in the political modernization of India published in 1967, Lloyd and Suzanne Rudolph were able to show how Gandhi turned elements of the Indian tradition to use in modernizing India. As they pointed out, “the assumption that modernity and tradition are radically contradictory rests on a misdiagnosis of tradition as it is found in traditional societies, a misunderstanding of modernity as it is found in modern societies, and a misapprehension of the relationship between them.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-702" id="calibre_link-744" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">30</a></small></sup> By the 1970s and the 1980s, it had become firmly established that the relationship between tradition and modernity is definitely a constructive one.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-703" id="calibre_link-745" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">31</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1306" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Tradition has also been ably defended by the humanists as well. In <i class="calibre9">The Vindication of Tradition,</i> Jaroslav Pelikan draws many illuminating examples from the Christian tradition to show how tradition can be appreciated as a “beauty ever ancient, ever new.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-704" id="calibre_link-746" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">32</a></small></sup> He distinguishes between “tradition” and “traditionalism.” In his own beautiful words, “tradition is the living faith of the dead, traditionalism is the dead faith of the living.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-705" id="calibre_link-747" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">33</a></small></sup> Needless to say, it is the former, not the latter, that he is defending. The most important thing to know about tradition is that it actually exists, he tells us (53). It is there waiting to be rediscovered, and then either recovered or rejected. The choice between recovery and rejection is ours to make, but we must understand our tradition before we choose. Understanding may involve us in the historical-critical study of our tradition, and no tradition is too sacred to be protected from such a critical inquiry, for to base recovery or rejection on ignorance “is not worthy of a free and rational person” (54).</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The idea that we can do away with tradition and start life completely anew is also powerfully criticized by a philosopher of science in the person of Stephen Toulmin. He calls this idea “the myth of the clean slate” and links it to the positivist conception of science in the seventeenth century. This conception rested not only on the quest for certainty and the equation of rationality with formal logic but also on the belief that the modern, rational way of dealing with problems is to sweep away the inherited clutter from traditions, clean the slate, and start again from scratch. It was also this “myth of the clean slate” that led to the most radical antitraditionalism of the French Revolution. Now, as the conception of science in our own time has been undergoing a profound change, the positivist intellectual structure has largely collapsed. As a consequence, Toulmin emphasizes not only the significance of tradition but also the plurality of cultural traditions. Without going relativist, he assumes that “all societies and cultures are equally good in their own ways.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-706" id="calibre_link-748" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">34</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Finally, I wish to conclude my discussion of tradition with a hermeneutic critique of the Enlightenment view. Gadamer, in <i class="calibre9">Truth and Method</i>, rejects the oppositions that have been so entrenched since the Enlightenment, such as those between reason and tradition, reason and authority, etc. Like Pelikan, he believes that tradition exists. Therefore, human beings are always situated within traditions. On the one hand, there is always an element of freedom in tradition, and on the other, tradition is also active in all historical change. Tradition needs to be preserved and preservation is an act of reason. But also like Toulmin, he does not think it possible for us to cut ourselves off from the inherited ideas of our cultures. As Gadamer assures us: “Even where life changes violently, as in ages of revolution, far more of the old is preserved in the supposed transformation of everything than anyone knows, and it combines with the new to create a new value.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-707" id="calibre_link-749" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">35</a></small></sup> Thus, in his own way, Gadamer also reaches a conclusion with regard to the dialectical relationship between tradition and modernity that is essentially similar to that of social scientists.</span></div>
<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">4</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1357" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the above, I hope I have somewhat succeeded in showing that Clio has been taking a new turn in the direction of culture in the past two decades. By making this observation, however, I do not mean to suggest that cultural history is to become the order of the day in Clio’s temple. What I am saying is rather that culture as a relatively autonomous force in history is now more clearly recognized than ever before. In light of this reorientation in historical thinking, I wish to explore the possibility of the rediscovery of tradition in Asia.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Owing to my own ignorance of the historiographical developments in other Asian societies, I can only illustrate my point by referring to the cases of China and Japan. However, since Chinese history and Japanese history have both been traditionally included in the broad field known as “Oriental Studies,” it seems pertinent to say a word about Edward Said’s provocative <i class="calibre9">Orientalism</i>. According to Said, the whole idea of Orientalism was an invention of the Eurocentric imperialist mentality. Western European missionaries, scholars, philosophers, historians, novelists, poets, and travelers, especially since the nineteenth century, had been fascinated by the vast cultural differences as they found them in the Orient, first in the Near East and then in the Far East. A sharp contrast between the Orient and the Occident was thus formed. In the course of time, however, the cultural differences between the Occident and the Orient became gradually crystallized into the ineradicable distinction between Western superiority and Eastern inferiority. In nineteenth-century Europe, Said tells us: “Every writer on the Orient, from Renan to Marx (ideologically speaking), or from the most rigorous scholars (Lane and Sacy) to the most powerful imaginations (Flaubert and Nerval), saw the Orient as a locale requiring Western attention, reconstruction, even redemption. The Orient existed as a place isolated from the mainstream of European progress in the sciences, arts and commerce.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-708" id="calibre_link-750" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">36</a></small></sup> The case of Marx is particularly illuminating. Much as he was sympathetic to the Indian people under British colonial rule, he nevertheless considered that rule beneficial to India in terms of its long-range historical evolution. Thus, Orientalism as a Western view of the Orient was imposed on the so-called oriental peoples as a whole. The discussions in Said’s <i class="calibre9">Orientalism</i> are focused on the Arabic societies, where, he says, this imposed view has been generally accepted by native “Orientalists.”</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>I am not qualified to judge whether Said’s thesis is valid. As far as I can see, Orientalism was as much intellectually informed by positivism as it was ideologically shaped by imperialism. If Western Orientalists viewed anything particularly Oriental as a deviation from the normal course of civilization, it was probably because they held their own civilization in Western Europe as the universal model. Moreover, Orientalism, with its emphasis on philology as the master-key to historical knowledge, was also conceived from the outset as a scientific enterprise. As a leading French Orientalist of the nineteenth century, Ernest Renan (1823&ndash;1892), put it, philology “is to the sciences of humanity what physics and chemistry are to the philosophic sciences of bodies.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-709" id="calibre_link-751" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">37</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1059" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>By the end of the nineteenth century, Orientalism had already been well established in Japan and China as an academic discipline in which history figured centrally. However, it must be emphatically pointed out that in both cases, Orientalism was self-imposed rather than imposed by Western imperialists or Orientalists. I shall begin with Japan, where Orientalism not only had developed earlier and better but also influenced Chinese historians at the turn of the century. According to a recent survey by Watanabe Hiroshi of the University of Tokyo, Japanese historiography since the Meiji Period has been dominated by the Western model. Generally speaking, modern Japanese mainstream historians over the past hundred years or so have, on the one hand, taken the historical development of Western civilization as the universal norm, and on the other, interpreted the “peculiarities” of Japanese history as deviations from the norm. It was such deviations that caused Japan to fall behind the West in the progress of civilization.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Watanabe divides modern Japanese historiography into several stages. First, during the 1870s and 1880s, “civilization historiography” arose. Inspired by Western positivists such as François Guizot (1787&ndash;1874), Henry T. Buckle (1821&ndash;1862), and Herbert Spencer (1820&ndash;1903), “civilization” historians tried to show that Japanese history basically followed the same “law of civilization” as that found in the West; it was merely a little slower due to its “peculiarities.” Then, at the turn of the century, a new generation of historians appeared on the scene. Under the influence of Thomas Carlyle (1795&ndash;1881) and Thomas B. Macaulay (1800&ndash;1859), they were more sensitive to historical details and avoided a simple and direct application of the idea of “civilization” to their own history. Nevertheless, they retained the faith in the universal progress of civilization as exemplified by the West. During the 1920s and early 1930s, Marxists became very active in the field of Japanese history. Needless to say, as positivists of the most militant type, they naturally took the historical process in Europe as “typical,” against which Japanese history with all its “peculiarities” must be measured. Finally, during the post&ndash;World War II period, Marxism became the mainstream in Japanese historiography, with a strong competition from the so-called Modernist school. The Modernists have adopted as their conceptual framework the paradigm of modernity versus tradition, which was very much in vogue in the West during the 1950s and 1960s. Again, the modernization process of the West served as the universal model and whatever remained uniquely Japanese in post-Meiji Japan has been taken by Modernists as nothing but vestiges of “premodern” or “traditional” times. This state of affairs has been fundamentally altered since the 1970s, however, when Japan clearly emerged as an economic superpower. Instead of viewing the “peculiarities” of Japanese history as obstacles to a full-fledged modernization of Japan, they are widely regarded as causes of the exceptional “success” of the Japanese economy. In concluding, Watanabe expresses the hope that the time has probably arrived that historians of Japan come up with new concepts and frameworks specifically suited to their task and cease to look to the West as the universal model. “Perhaps,” says he, “every society or region is ‘particular’ in its own way, like an individual.”<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-710" id="calibre_link-752" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">38</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1166" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>It is clear that over the past century, the changing views Japanese historians developed regarding their own national history vis-à-vis Western civilization fit remarkably well with the idea of Orientalism as defined by Said. As clearly shown above, however, these views were all homegrown; there is no evidence that they had been influenced by Western Orientalism. Instead, they seem to have directly resulted from the fact that many Japanese historians had wholeheartedly accepted Western historical positivism in its various versions as universal truth.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Now let us move on to China. The birthplace of modern Chinese historiography was actually Tokyo, where leading Chinese historians such as Liang Qichao <span>梁</span><span>啟</span><span>超</span> (1873&ndash;1929) and Zhang Binglin <span>章</span><span>炳</span><span>麟</span> (1869&ndash;1935) came to seek refuge in the early years of the century and became exposed to the influence of Japanese “civilization historiography.” As a result, Chinese historians also began to follow the Japanese example by reconstructing and reinterpreting the Chinese past according to the historical model of the West. This is clearly discernible in the two essays on “New History” written by Liang Qichao in 1901 and 1902, which practically started a revolution in Chinese historiography. Liang’s adoption of the European scheme of periodization (ancient, medieval, and modern), as well as his unquestioning acceptance of the Spencerian theory of social evolution, were to exert a shaping influence on Chinese historiography in the decades to come. It hardly needs mentioning that both had long been in practice in the Japanese historical profession.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>The same is true with the influential National Essence historiography headed by Zhang Binglin and Liu Shipei <span>劉</span><span>師</span><span>培</span> (1884&ndash;1919). The term “national essence” (<i class="calibre9">guocui</i> <span>國</span><span>粹</span> in Chinese and <i class="calibre9">kokusui</i> in Japanese) was a neologism borrowed from Japan, where a cultural movement arose in the 1880s as a reaction against the wave of Westernization. However, while the Japanese <i class="calibre9">kokusui</i> was primarily a group of cultural critics, the Chinese <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> historians were most enthusiastic to apply all kinds of Western theories&mdash;sociological, anthropological, political, and historical&mdash;to the Chinese past. As a matter of fact, a careful examination of some of the leading historians’ writings reveals that what they identified as “national essence” consisted primarily of values and ideas dominant in the modern West such as “democracy,” “equality,” “liberty,” “human rights,” etc. They justified this identification on the grounds that these values and ideas had long been recognized as well as developed by Chinese thinkers completely independently of the West. Liu Shipei, for example, traced the indigenous origins and evolution of the so-called Chinese theories of “social contract” from the classical age to the nineteenth century. In other words, the Chinese “national essence” was by and large the Western model in disguise.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-711" id="calibre_link-753" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">39</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1387" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>With the rise of scientism since the May Fourth Movement of 1919, positivism has further tightened its grip on the Chinese historical mind. Time does not permit me to go into details. Suffice it to say that the central influence in mainstream Chinese historiography between 1919 and 1949 was the so-called scientific history as vigorously advocated by Hu Shi <span>胡</span><span>適</span> (1891&ndash;1962) and Fu Sinian <span>傅</span><span>斯</span><span>年</span> (1896&ndash;1950), and since 1949, the study of history in China has been completely dominated by the state-imposed Marxism. To be fair, neither Hu nor Fu was a radical antitraditionalist. However, like <i class="calibre9">guocui</i> historians before him, Hu also redefined the Chinese tradition in terms of Western values, particularly democracy and science. There can be no doubt that the learned movement known as <i class="calibre9">Zhengli guogu</i> <span>整</span><span>理</span><span>國</span><span>故</span> (systematic and critical study of the National Past) led by Hu contributed immensely to the modernization of Chinese historical scholarship, but it must also be pointed out that the whole movement was cast in a positivistic mold. As Hu made clear, a central purpose of the movement was to apply the procedure of science to historical studies.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-712" id="calibre_link-754" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">40</a></small></sup> Moreover, his interest in the Chinese tradition was also narrowly focused on its compatibility with “the scientific and democratic civilization” of the modern West.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-713" id="calibre_link-755" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">41</a></small></sup> In his most radical moments, he could even go so far as to state categorically that what is good in the Chinese tradition is universally present in all higher civilizations, whereas what is uniquely Chinese in the tradition often turns out to be undesirable from the modern point of view.<sup class="calibre12"><small class="calibre13"><a href="#calibre_link-714" id="calibre_link-756" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">42</a></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>On the other hand, built on the foundation of the May Fourth iconoclastic antitraditionalism, Chinese Marxist historiography seems particularly biased against tradition. In spite of the often-quoted rhetoric of “preserving the essence of dismiss the dregs,” it is generally negative toward the Chinese past. The extreme hostility with which the Confucian tradition is viewed, for example, made Marxist historians contemptuously dismissive of practically all the major thinkers, scholars, writers, and poets from the age of Confucius to the nineteenth century. As a result, their historical studies of aspects of the Chinese cultural tradition often amount to condemnation and indictment.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>It is not my intention at all to discredit modern Chinese historiography. The peculiar Chinese mentality of cultural self-indictment and self-immolation in the twentieth century is deeply rooted in a historical predicament of immense complexities. Nor does the responsibility for failure to discover any positive meaning in the Chinese tradition rest wholly with the way Chinese historians have treated their own past. What I am trying to say is that positivism, especially in its extreme form of scientism, tends to harden the historian’s mind to the point that he or she is no longer capable of sympathetic understanding and sensitive appreciation of tradition or culture. Unfortunately, the four core elements of historical positivism, as discussed in the beginning of my speech, have been taken by twentieth-century Chinese historians as self-evident truths, sometimes in part and sometimes wholly. This, coupled with Western history as the universal model, has prevented them from studying Chinese history on its own terms, with the inevitable result that the possibility of Chinese culture as a tradition with characteristics distinctly its own has been too readily ignored.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1309" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Now, with the positivist project as a whole and historical positivism in particular being seriously and critically questioned on the one hand and Clio’s new cultural turn on the other, it seems possible for Chinese historians to be freed from being obsessed with the Western model as well as awakened from the century-long illusions that universal truth must be sought from the West. It is disheartening to see that nowadays even when Chinese intellectuals are “critical” of the West, they are still uncritically following some of the critical theories that happen to be in currency in the West. Needless to say, I am far from proposing any kind of intellectual isolationism in the study of Chinese history. From time to time, Chinese historians will surely find concepts, methods, paradigms, generalizations, etc., developed in Western historical scholarship suggestive and illuminating for comparative or some other purposes; however, it is imperative that Chinese historians begin to design and develop their own concepts and methods uniquely suited to coping with the particular shapes of Chinese historical experience independent of, but not in isolation from, theories and practices of history in other parts of the world, including the West. I must also make myself clear that although I have been critical of the positivist frame of mind, I am nevertheless fully aware of the fact that what Hu Shi called the “critical and scientific method” does have its due place in the study of history. I also believe that historical objectivity, though difficult, is possible. Nihilism or unrestrained relativism abhors me no less than does extreme positivism. If we agree with Geertz, however, that the study of culture is “not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning,” then the “critical and scientific method” alone is hardly adequate to the task. From the cultural point of view, therefore, history as a discipline is more an interpretive enterprise than a scientific one. It is my biased view that the history of every society of people deserves to be studied not only as part of world history but also because of its intrinsic value. Only in this way will rediscovery of the Chinese tradition in all its richness and individuality, and for that matter, all the traditions in the Asian world, become a real possibility.</span></div>

<div class="noindent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1364" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>I feel enormously honored to be a corecipient of the John W. Kluge Prize in 2006, for which I am grateful. After much reflection, however, I have come to the realization that the main justification for my presence here today is that both the Chinese cultural tradition and Chinese intellectual history as a discipline are being honored through me. The former has been the subject of my lifetime scholarly pursuit, and the latter my chosen field of specialization.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>When I first became seriously interested in the study of Chinese history and culture in the 1940s, the Chinese historical mind happened to be cast in a positivistic and antitraditionalistic mold. The whole Chinese past was viewed negatively, and whatever appeared to be uniquely Chinese was interpreted as a deviation from the universal norm of progress of civilization as exemplified in the historical development of the West. As a result, studies of aspects of the Chinese cultural tradition, from philosophy, law, and religion to literature and art, often amounted to condemnation and indictment. Needless to say, I was at a complete loss as to the Chinese cultural identity and, for that matter, also my personal identity. It was my good fortune that I was able to finish my college education in Hong Kong and pursued my graduate studies in the United States, now my adopted country.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1067" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>As my intellectual horizon gradually widened over the years, the truth was beginning to dawn on me that Chinese culture must be clearly recognized as an indigenous tradition with characteristics distinctly its own. The crystallization of Chinese culture into its definitive shape took place in the time of Confucius (551&ndash;479 <small class="calibre7">B.C.E.</small>), a crucial moment in the ancient world better known in the West as the Axial Age. During this period, it has been observed, a spiritual awakening or “breakthrough” occurred in several highly developed cultures, including China, India, Persia, Israel, and Greece. It took the form of either philosophical reasoning or postmythical religious imagination, or, as in the case of China, a mixed type of moral-philosophic-religious consciousness. The awakening led directly to the emergence of the dichotomy between the actual world and the world beyond. The world beyond as a new vision provided the thinking individuals, be they philosophers, prophets, or sages, with the necessary transcending point from which the actual world could be examined and questioned, critically as well as reflectively. This is generally known as the original transcendence of the Axial Age, of which the exact shape, empirical content, and historical process varied from culture to culture. The transcendence is original in the sense that it would exert a long-lasting, shaping influence on the cultures involved.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As a result of the Chinese original transcendence in the time of Confucius, the all-important idea of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> (Way) emerged as a symbol of the world beyond vis-à-vis the actual world of everyday life. But the Chinese transcendental world of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> and the actual world of everyday life were conceived from the very beginning to be related to each other in a way that was different from other ancient cultures undergoing the Axial breakthrough. For example, there is nothing in the early Chinese philosophical visions that suggests Plato’s conception of an unseen eternal world of which the actual world is only a pale copy. In the religious tradition, the sharp dichotomy of a Christian type between the world of God and the world of humans is also absent. Nor do we find in classical Chinese thought in all its varieties anything that closely resembles the radical negativity of early Buddhism, with its insistence on the unrealness and worthlessness of this world. By contrast, the world of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> was not perceived as very far from the human world. As best expressed by Confucius: “The <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is not far from man. When a man pursues the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, and remains away from man, his course cannot be considered the <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>.” I must hasten to add, however, that the notion of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> was not the monopoly of Confucius and his followers but was shared by all the major thinkers in the Chinese Axial Age, including Laozi, Mozi, and Zhuangzi. It was their common belief that <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> is hidden and yet functions everywhere in the human world; even men and women of simple intelligence can know and practice it in everyday life to a larger or lesser degree. Indeed, judging from the ever-growing and ever-deepening influences of the ideas originating in the Axial Age, especially Confucian and Daoist ideas, on all aspects of Chinese life down through the centuries, it may not be too much an exaggeration to suggest that <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> and history constitute the inside and the outside of Chinese civilization.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-2505" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Taking the Chinese cultural tradition to be essentially one of indigenous origin and independent growth, I have tried over the decades to study Chinese history along two main lines. First, Chinese culture must be understood in its own terms, but at the same time, also in a comparative perspective. By “comparative perspective,” I refer to both Indian Buddhism in the early imperial period and Western culture since the sixteenth century. Needless to say, China’s second encounter with the West in the nineteenth century was a historical event of world-shaking magnitude. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the Chinese mind has been largely preoccupied with the problematique of China-versus-the-West. To interpret the Chinese past solely in its own terms without a comparative perspective would surely run the risk of falling into the age-old trap of simple-minded Sinocentrism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Second, in my study of Chinese intellectual, social, and cultural history, from classical antiquity to the twentieth century, my focus has always been placed on periods of change when one historical stage moved to the next. Compared to other civilizations, China’s is particularly marked by its long historical continuity before, during, and since the Axial Age. But continuity and change went hand-in-hand in Chinese history. Therefore, the purpose I have set myself is twofold: first, to identify the major intellectual, social, and culture changes in the Chinese past and, second, to discern if at all possible the unique pattern of Chinese historical changes. More often than not, such broad and profound changes in Chinese history transcended the rise and fall of dynasties. Thus, the notion of “dynastic cycle,” long held in traditional China but also briefly in vogue in the West, is highly misleading. In the early years of the twentieth century, Chinese historians, following the example of their Japanese colleagues, began to reconstruct and reinterpret the Chinese past according to the historical model of the West. Since then it has been generally assumed that China must have undergone similar stages of historical development as shown in European history. In the first half of the twentieth century, Chinese historians adopted the earlier European schemes of periodization by dividing Chinese history into ancient, medieval, and modern periods, which has been replaced since 1949 by the Marxist-Stalinist five-stage formulation. The latter remains the orthodoxy in China up to this day, at least in theory if not always in actual practice. This procrustean approach, whatever merits it may otherwise have, cannot possibly do full justice to Chinese culture as an indigenous tradition. Only by focusing on the unique course and shape of Chinese historical changes, I am convinced, can we hope to see more clearly how that great cultural tradition moved from stage to stage, driven mainly, if not entirely, by its internal dynamics.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1270" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Now let me turn to the question of how, as two different systems of values, does Chinese culture stand vis-à-vis Western culture in historical perspective? My earliest exposure to this question occurred in the late 1940s when the problematique of China-versus-the-West, mentioned earlier, dominated the Chinese intellectual world. It has not been out of my consciousness ever since. Living in the United States for half a century, the question has acquired a truly existential meaning for my life as I move between the two cultures from moment to moment. With some initial psychological readjustments, I have long been able to enjoy the American way of life while still retaining my Chinese cultural identity. However, the best guide with regard to whether Chinese culture is compatible with the core values of the West can only be provided by Chinese history.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>China first encountered the modern West at the end of the sixteenth century when the Jesuits came to East Asia to do their missionary work. The culturally sensitive Matteo Ricci, who arrived in China in 1583, was very quick to discover that the Chinese religious atmosphere at that time was highly tolerant; Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism were generally regarded as one and the same thing. As a matter of fact, under the influence of Wang Yangming (1472&ndash;1529), late Ming Confucians firmly believed that each of the three religions in China captured a vision of the same <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> (Way). It was this spirit of religious tolerance that accounted for Ricci’s extraordinary success in his conversion of many leading members of the Confucian elite, notably Xu Guangqi (1562&ndash;1633), Li Zhizao (1565&ndash;1630), and Yang Tingyun (1557&ndash;1627)&mdash;the “three pillars of evangelization.” The Confucian faith in the sameness of human mind and the universal accessibility of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> to every human person anywhere led some Chinese converts to promote a synthesis of Christianity with Confucianism. The Chinese <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> was now further expanded to include Christianity. This early relationship between China and the West at the religious level can by no means be described as a conflictual one.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1000" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>In the late nineteenth century, it was also the open-minded Confucians who enthusiastically embraced values and ideas dominant in the modern West, such as democracy, liberty, equality, rule of law, autonomy of the individual person, and, above all, human rights. When some of them visited Europe or America for the first time and stayed there long enough to make firsthand observations, they were all deeply impressed, first of all, by the ideals and institutions of Western constitutional democracy. Wang Tao (1828&ndash;1897), who assisted James Legge in his English translation of Confucian classics, returned to Hong Kong from England in 1870 praising her political and legal systems to the sky. He was probably the first Confucian scholar to use the term “democracy” in Chinese (<i class="calibre9">minzhu</i>). Wang exerted a considerable influence on Confucian political thinking in the late Qing. At the turn of the century, there were two rival Confucian schools in China known as the New Text and Old Text, respectively. Both advocated democracy, though each in its own way. The former was in favor of constitutional monarchy, while the latter pushed for republicanism. Perhaps inspired by Wang Tao, who compared the British political and judicial systems favorably to China’s Golden Age as described in Confucian classics, both Confucian schools began a systematic search for the origins and evolution of democratic ideas in early Confucian texts. In so doing, it is clear that they took the compatibility between Chinese culture and Western culture as two systems of values for granted.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>Last but not least, I wish to say a word about “human rights.” Like “democracy,” “human rights” as a term is linguistically specific to the West and nonexistent in traditional Confucian discourse. However, if we agree that the concept of “human rights” as defined in the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of 1948 is predicated on the double recognition of a common humanity and human dignity, then we are also justified to speak of a Confucian idea of “human rights” without the Western terminology. Recognition of a common humanity and respect for human dignity are both clearly articulated in the <i class="calibre9">Analects</i> of Confucius, the <i class="calibre9">Mencius</i>, and other early texts. It is remarkable that by the first century <small class="calibre7">C.E.</small> at the latest, the Confucian notion of human dignity was openly referred to in imperial decrees as sufficient grounds for the prohibition of the sale or killing of slaves. Both imperial decrees, dated 9 and 35 <small class="calibre7">C.E.</small>, respectively, cited the same famous Confucian dictum: “Of all living things produced by Heaven and Earth, the human person is the noblest.” Slavery as an institution was never accepted by Confucianism as legitimate. It was this Confucian humanism that predisposed late Qing Confucians to be so readily appreciative of the Western theory and practice of human rights.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>If history is any guide, then there seems to be a great deal of overlapping consensus in basic values between Chinese culture and Western culture. After all, recognition of common humanity and human dignity is what the Chinese <i class="calibre9">Dao</i> has been about. I am more convinced than ever that once Chinese culture returns to the main flow of <i class="calibre9">Dao</i>, the problematique of China-versus-the-West will also come to an end.</span></div>

<div class="head"><span class="calibre4">ACCEPTANCE SPEECH ON THE OCCASION OF RECEIVING THE TANG PRIZE FOR SINOLOGY</span></div>
<div class="noindent"><span>To be awarded the inaugural Tang Prize in Sinology is the greatest honor I have received in my life. Needless to say, I feel grateful and elated even though deep in my heart, I must confess, lurks an indelible sense of undeservedness.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span><a id="calibre_link-1264" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a>Sinology, my own field of research, writing, and teaching, calls for a comment. To begin with, I must pay tribute to the Tang Prize Foundation for its farsightedness in recognizing Sinology as one of its four prize categories. In my considered opinion, Sinology as a scholarly endeavor of ever-growing world importance is more in need of encouragement and support now than ever before. It is truly remarkable that the Tang Prize comes right in the nick of time.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In recent decades, Sinology as a field of study has been undergoing a gradual but very significant transformation. China has come to be viewed more and more as a civilization of indigenous origin and independent growth very much comparable to other long-lasting ancient civilizations such as India, Persia, Israel, and Greece. Unlike in the past, we begin to move away from the practice of reconstructing and interpreting the Chinese past according to the historical model of the West. Instead, Sinologists, in ever-growing numbers, tend to be interested in understanding the growth of Chinese civilization on its own terms. It is generally assumed that only by focusing on the unique course and shape of Chinese historical changes can we hope to see more clearly how that great cultural tradition moved from stage to stage, driven primarily by its internal dynamics. However, this must not be mistaken as advocacy of isolationism. On the contrary, the importance of a comparative perspective in Sinological studies is more emphasized today than ever before. The reason is not far to seek. The uniqueness of Chinese civilization and its developmental pattern cannot be firmly and fully established without comparisons with other civilizations, especially the Western one. On the other hand, to study Chinese history in total isolation would inevitably fall into the age-old trap of Sinocentrism.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>As a result, Sinology today has become thoroughly globalized. Unlike in the first half of the twentieth century, we rarely, if ever, speak of Sinology along national lines such as Chinese, Japanese, French, or American. Sinology is one anywhere on the globe. At this very juncture, my memory naturally goes to my late mentor Yang Lien-sheng, who introduced me to world Sinology at Harvard in the late 1950s. In his 1967 introduction to Yang’s path-breaking <i class="calibre9">Excursions in Sinology</i> [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1969], Paul Demiéville, the dean of Sinology in Europe, characterizes the latter’s scholarship as “international, truly <i class="calibre9">tianxia</i> (<span>天</span><span>下</span>).” This clearly suggests that globalization of Sinology was already well under way at the time, and my mentor Yang was positively identified by Demiéville as one of its earliest practitioners.</span></div>
<div class="indent"><span>In this age of rapid globalization of ours, this new development in Sinology urgently needs to be carried further on an ever-growing scale. It is therefore my earnest hope that the Tang Prize may serve to attract more young talents with vibrant minds that will bring fresh perspectives to the Sinological world.</span></div>
