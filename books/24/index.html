<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2382" href="#calibre_link-2472" class="calibre5">THE ROLE OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY IN TODAY’S WORLD</a></p>
<p class="noindent1">You’ve decided that you want to be a military aviator. Now you just have to figure out how to get there.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s commendable&mdash;military aviation is a noble, worthwhile, and even exciting profession, and you have shown good initiative and judgment by choosing this book to improve your chances for selection.</p>
<p class="indent">You may already be a member of the U.S. military, or you may just be considering your options. Either way, you need to know the bigger picture. You will have to study hard and prepare thoroughly to be selected as a military aviator&mdash;and then you will have to successfully complete long periods of challenging training, just to get started.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you measure up? The answer is <span class="italic">Yes</span>&mdash;if you prepare the right way. This book will help.</p>
<p class="indent">The American military exists (as you know, if you are already a service member) to protect and defend the people and freedoms of the United States of America. Its establishment is provided for in the Constitution, it is drawn from the nation it represents, and today’s all-volunteer military ultimately reflects the best of the nation it defends&mdash;those who are willing to sacrifice or subordinate their own desires and comfort for the benefit and protection of all.</p>
<p class="indent">Today’s American military is the world’s largest “meritocracy,” where rewards are primarily based on demonstrated merit and performance&mdash;not on an individual’s background, social or economic status, race, ethnicity, connections, or other unearned factors. It is, on average, somewhat better educated than the country it represents&mdash;maybe because it emphasizes the value of education and self-improvement&mdash;and it includes every possible race, religion, ethnicity, and the like . . . even non-U.S. citizens who believe that our principles and way of life are worth fighting for. It’s not perfect, and it definitely isn’t easy&mdash;but it’s better than anything else out there.</p>
<p class="indent">The U.S. military is one of the most respected American institutions, steeped in tradition and service and bound together by principles of honor, courage, and loyalty found nowhere else. It is by no means perfect&mdash;no human institution can be&mdash;but it holds itself and its members accountable and strives to become better.</p>
<p class="indent">And make no mistake, the United States is still at war <span class="italic">with those who declared war on us</span> years before September 11, 2001. More than a decade and a half of struggle and sacrifice have not been enough to finish the war against those who hate our liberties and want to either dictate how we think, act, and believe . . . or kill us. We have made tremendous inroads and huge progress, but we are not yet done&mdash;the mission is not yet complete.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2845" class="calibre3"></a>It is precisely because of our freedoms and the blessings of our human and natural resources that we are able to fight a war against an enemy thousands of miles away and not have rationing and shortages at home . . . where war news is given far less play than entertainment and business news . . . and where only one percent of the population has seen military service.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are reading this, you are to be commended for considering how you can become part of that one percent.</p>
<p class="indent">The Cold War lasted 46 years, from the end of World War II in 1945 to the fall of the Soviet Union and its satellite dictatorships in 1991. Anyone who thinks that the current war against terror and violent extremism is less of a generational war&mdash;that it can be solved by just packing up and coming home&mdash;is sadly mistaken. Just because we as a nation, as a culture, are willing to “live and let live” <span class="italic">does not mean that other people think the same way.</span> This is a hard truth, but one that needs and deserves understanding.</p>
<p class="indent">The War on Terror fought by the United States and its allies since September 11, 2001, has been waged not only by the active, full-time component of all the services, but also by the Reserves of all the services, and by Army and Air National Guard units from all 54 states and territories. Active duty unit deployments that lasted a year or more&mdash;sometimes with a year or less in between&mdash;have given way to deployments of nine months or less overseas for ground troops (less for Air Force and Navy units). National Guard and Reserve units now have one to four years between deployments.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of whether the U.S. military is scheduled to grow or shrink in any given year (and it does go back and forth), all the services have a critical need for a steady stream of the highest-quality applicants, especially those who want to become aviators. Even during times when there is a pilot shortage, the services can’t afford to lower their standards, and they won’t.</p>
<p class="indent">Only the best will be chosen&mdash;will that be you?</p>
<p class="indent">It can be. Read and apply what’s in this book&mdash;then it’s up to you.</p>
<p class="indent">Military aviation is a vital part of the U.S. air, sea, and land forces that defend our nation and our way of life. Aviation units are integrated into the Army, Marine Corps, and Navy&mdash;and they are, of course, present in a “purer” sense in the most air-oriented branch of the military, the Air Force.</p>

<p class="box_noindent"><span class="gotham-medium1">The following information is meant to give you some context and background about how the American military, and especially American military aviation, is organized. <b class="bold">This is primarily because all three services’ flight aptitude tests include problems and questions that require some understanding of the overall organization besides just surface-level math and reading skills, or even scientific or technical knowledge.</b> Other information will focus more on helping you understand what it takes to be an American military officer, rather than just focusing specifically on aviation. That’s because, in all the services, you have to qualify to be an officer or a warrant officer first, and then to be an aviator.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The aircraft of the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps are versatile, hard-hitting forces that can be employed swiftly anywhere in the world. These forces can quickly gain and maintain air superiority over regional aggressors and provide close air support for U.S. ground forces, permitting rapid air attacks on enemy targets while providing security and support for ground forces to conduct logistics, mission command, intelligence, and other functions.</p>
<p class="indent">Fighter/attack aircraft, operating from both land bases and aircraft carriers, oppose enemy fighters and attack ground and ship targets. Conventional bombers provide a worldwide capability to strike surface targets on short notice. Specialized aircraft supporting conventional operations perform functions such as airborne early warning and control, <a id="calibre_link-2846" class="calibre3"></a>suppression of enemy air defenses, reconnaissance, surveillance, and combat search and rescue. In addition, the U.S. military operates a variety of transport planes, aerial-refueling aircraft, helicopters, and other support aircraft.</p>
<p class="indent">The role of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in both reconnaissance and attack missions is growing in all the services. Technological advances are enabling more and more capabilities to be placed on increasingly smaller airframes.</p>
<p class="indent">The ability of these forces to have an immediate impact on a conflict by precision attacks on selected enemy targets has expanded dramatically as an increasing proportion of “smart” munitions has been deployed.</p>
<p class="indent">Special operations aviation forces contribute to all phases of military operations. Some of their most important missions are insertion, support, and extraction of special operations forces; suppression of enemy air defenses; and aerial reconnaissance and surveillance.</p>
<p class="indent">Coast Guard aviation elements work in conjunction with ship- and shore-based units to perform their missions of coastal security and rescue and law enforcement. Their aircraft are specially adapted to the needs of their missions; in wartime they provide an important contribution to homeland defense, in addition to their other duties.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2383" href="#calibre_link-2473" class="calibre5">Roles, Duties, and Opportunities of Military Officers</a></p>
<p class="noindent">If you are going to be an American military aviator or pilot, you will also generally be a commissioned or warrant officer. An <span class="italic">officer</span>, in the broadest sense of the term, is someone in an organization who has both the authority and the obligation to <span class="italic">lead</span>&mdash;to exert influence over others to accomplish the mission . . . to get the job done.</p>
<p class="indent">Aviation units have proportionately more officers than other units, in all the services, simply because almost all pilots are either commissioned or warrant officers. Military flying is a very technical <span class="italic">and</span> a very physical business. The educational, age, and other requirements have evolved based on studies of the types of people who have been successful in pilot training and beyond.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2384" href="#calibre_link-2474" class="calibre5">Military Rank Structure, Pay, and Benefits</a></p>
<p class="noindent">There are three types of officers in the U.S. military: commissioned officers, warrant officers, and noncommissioned officers. The remaining service members are known as “enlisted personnel.” Every <span class="italic">rank</span>, officer or not, has a <span class="italic">pay grade</span> associated with it. Many times the rank and the pay grade are used interchangeably, but not always. Even though they do have leadership responsibilities, noncommissioned officers (“NCOs” for short) are also enlisted; the jump from the “just enlisted” lower ranks to NCO occurs at pay grade E-4 or E-5, depending on the service. The pay grades for enlisted members run from E-1 to E-9, for warrant officers from W-1 to W-5, and for commissioned officers from O-1 to O-10; you can see more detail in the charts that follow.</p>
<p class="indent">Pay grades can also be useful for comparison purposes among the services due to rank titles that are sometimes confusing. For example, an Air Force staff sergeant is an E-5, whereas an Army or Marine staff sergeant is an E-6. Likewise, an Army or Marine captain is an O-3, but a Navy or Coast Guard captain is an O-6.</p>
<p class="indent">The bottom line is that the same pay grade with the same number of years of service will get paid the same base pay, no matter which service they are in or what position they are currently assigned. Aviators, however, frequently get extra pay on top of this&mdash;but more about that shortly.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2847" class="calibre3"></a>A few other technicalities: the Navy and Coast Guard call their NCOs <span class="italic">petty officer</span><span class="italic">s</span>; the Air Force doesn’t have any warrant officers; the commander of a Navy or Coast Guard ship is commonly called <span class="italic">captain</span> regardless of pay grade or rank, and the Navy and Coast Guard use the term <span class="italic">rate</span> instead of <span class="italic">rank</span> when referring to enlisted personnel. Here, though, we are going to use only the term <span class="italic">rank</span> to avoid confusion, and <span class="italic">captain</span> will be a rank unless it’s specified to be the commander of a ship.</p>
<p class="indent">When people refer to “officers” as such, they are usually talking about commissioned officers: those who have a <span class="italic">commission</span> at the direction of the president of the United States to act on his behalf (the military falls under the executive branch of government). Sometimes, though, they are talking about commissioned officers <span class="italic">and</span> warrant officers. Warrant officers have a <span class="italic">warrant</span> from the Secretary (head civilian official) of their service to perform special technical or staff functions.</p>
<p class="indent">The military values experience, as demonstrated by the fact that they pay more for it. Even though the newest second lieutenant or ensign (an O-1 in either case) technically outranks a senior NCO with possibly decades of experience, woe be unto that new officer if he or she doesn’t take into account the wisdom and counsel of that experienced NCO!</p>
<p class="indent">And, yes, officers get paid more than the other pay grades. That’s because they usually have more responsibility than the other pay grades&mdash;significantly more, in many cases. Even if an officer is not in a command position, his or her action (or inaction) can have a significant effect on service members and units, for either better or worse.</p>
<p class="indent">And, because of the “special trust and confidence in the patriotism, valor, fidelity, and abilities” placed in officers, there’s a higher price to pay for failure. Not only could service members be hurt or killed (which is bad enough) because an officer did something stupid or wrong, but the officer can be relieved and discharged from the service, as opposed to an enlisted member, who might be fined or reduced one or more pay grades but allowed to stay in the military.</p>
<p class="indent">Some other benefits to military service regardless of pay grade include structured pay raises within pay grades over time (something you will seldom see in the civilian world); the potential for nontaxable allowances for subsistence (meals) and housing, depending on your situation; the opportunity for all of your basic pay to be tax free during those periods you are deployed to a combat zone; medical care; and special pays such as flight pay, sea pay, parachutist pay (commonly known as “jump pay”), combat zone pay, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">The U.S. military usually gets at least a small pay raise once a year, usually in January, but this depends on Congress&mdash;there are no guarantees. The latest full pay table is available at <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.dfas.mil/militarymembers/payentitlements/military-pay-charts.html" class="calibre3">http://www.dfas.mil/militarymembers/payentitlements/military-pay-charts.html</a>.</span></p>
<p class="indent">In addition, military aviators are eligible for some special pays:</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="underline">Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP)</span> is a financial incentive for officers to serve as military aviators throughout a military career. Payments range from $125 to $1,000 per month, determined by the needs of the service and the individual’s years of service.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="underline">Aviation Continuation Pay (ACP)</span> is a financial incentive designed to retain qualified, experienced officer aviators who have completed their Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) if they remain on active duty for a specified period of additional service. Services may pay thousands of dollars for each year of a qualified aviator’s service agreement.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Air Force, Army, Navy, and Coast Guard each have three main sources of commissioned officers: their service academy, their officer candidate or training school, and college-level Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). As part of the Department of the Navy, potential officers of the U.S. Marine Corps attend the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and participate in Naval ROTC, but they have their own Officer Candidate Course, separate from the Navy. Requirements for the service academies include being between 17 and 23 at the time of enrollment, outstanding high school records and test results, and a nomination from a member of Congress or the Executive Branch. Requirements for commissioning and for pilot/aviator training selection are similar among the services, with some benchmarks set by law and others by the services, based on their needs at that time.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2386" href="#calibre_link-2476" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">U.S. Air Force</span></a></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw" src="images/00376.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The U.S. Air Force has three pathways to becoming an officer first, after which you may be selected to become a pilot: the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) at Colorado Springs, Colorado; Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC), offered at more than 1,100 colleges and universities throughout the country; and Officer Training School (OTS), where current enlisted Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard members can be selected to undergo training and evaluations that can result in their commissioning as an officer.</p>
<p class="indent">The U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, established in 1954, is the premier source of Air Force officers, graduating more than 800 second lieutenants each year. Applicants compete based on their overall high school record, college entrance test scores, physical fitness scores, and military test scores. USAFA cadets are paid during their four years of attendance and incur a mandatory service obligation upon their graduation and commissioning as second lieutenants.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two primary routes to an Air Force commission through AFROTC&mdash;the four-year program and the two-year program. Students in both programs attend AFROTC classes along with other college courses and normally receive elective academic credit. Cadets who successfully complete all requirements are commissioned as Air Force officers with a four-year active duty service commitment. Those selected as pilots, combat systems officers, and air battle managers have longer commitments upon completion of specialized training. If you want to be a pilot, you must be commissioned before you reach 29 years of age; you also have to meet Air Force height and weight requirements and pass a physical fitness test.</p>
<p class="indent">The Air Force conducts its Officer Training School (OTS) at Maxwell Air Force Base (AFB), Alabama, for current Air Force enlisted members who already have a bachelor’s degree, meet physical and age requirements, have their commander’s recommendation, and are chosen by a selection board. OTS is a demanding nine-week course that graduates a varying number of officers each year based on the needs of the total Air Force, which includes the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard. Upon graduation, candidates are commissioned as Air Force second lieutenants and proceed to technical training for their officer specialty.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of commissioning source, prospective Air Force pilots are assessed against a Pilot Candidate Selection Method (PCSM) index that measures a candidate’s aptitude for pilot training. The PCSM takes into account the Pilot composite score on the Air Force Officer <a id="calibre_link-2853" class="calibre3"></a>Qualifying Test (AFOQT), the Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS), and any previous flying hours (such as if you already have a private pilot’s license).</p>
<p class="indent">A new version of the AFOQT, known as the “Form T,” was introduced in 2014. The changes in Form T were based on feedback from an Air Force&ndash;wide survey where current officers identified the most important abilities and aptitudes needed for effectiveness as an officer. Form T changes include:</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span>Updated test questions throughout</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>Elimination of the Rotated Blocks and Hidden Figures subtests</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>Addition of new Reading Comprehension and Situational Judgment subtests</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>Updated graphics in the Instrument Comprehension subtest and an increase in the number of questions from 20 to 25</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>An increase in the number of questions on the Block Counting subtest (from 20 to 30 questions)</p>
<p class="bll"><span class="tcn">■</span>Revised General Science subtest, with a focus on the physical sciences and renamed as the “Physical Science” subtest</p>
<p class="indent">The Reading Comprehension subtest contributes to the AFOQT Verbal and Academic aptitude composites and incorporates the types of written information used in Air Force officer professional military education. The Situational Judgment subtest contributes to a new composite that measures judgment and decision-making when responding to the types of interpersonal situations often encountered by junior USAF officers.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll go over both the AFOQT and the TBAS in much more detail in <a href="#calibre_link-2477" class="calibre3">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2387" href="#calibre_link-2478" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">U.S. Army</span></a></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw1" src="images/00407.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The U.S. Army also has three primary sources of commissioned officers: the U.S. Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York; Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), offered at more than 900 colleges and universities nationwide; and Officer Candidate School (OCS), where current enlisted soldiers can be selected to undergo training and assessments that can see them being commissioned as officers.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Army, aviators are either commissioned or warrant officers. Both have an aviation “branch,” but this is not to be confused with <span class="italic">branches of service</span> (Army, Navy, etc.). Warrant officers fly more over the course of time, but they also spend less time in leadership positions within aviation units&mdash;although, as warrant officers, they are expected to be unparalleled subject matter experts on flying.</p>
<p class="indent">The USMA, established in 1802, is the premier source of officers for the Army, graduating more than 900 highly trained second lieutenants a year. Applicants compete based on their overall high school record, college entrance exams, demonstrated leadership abilities, physical fitness scores, and military test scores. USMA cadets are paid during their four years of attendance, and incur a five-year mandatory service obligation upon their graduation and commissioning.</p>
<p class="indent">Army ROTC commissions about 4,000 new second lieutenants a year&mdash;well over half the active Army’s requirement. Students in Army ROTC attend military science classes along with other college courses and normally receive elective academic credit. Cadets who successfully complete all requirements are commissioned as Army officers with an eight-year total commitment, at least six of which must be in an active, Reserve, or National Guard unit. If you <a id="calibre_link-2854" class="calibre3"></a>want to be a pilot, you must be commissioned before you reach 29 years of age, and you must enter flight school no later than your 30th birthday.</p>
<p class="indent">The Army conducts OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia, for the active Army, the U.S. Army Reserve, and selected members of the Army National Guard. Army OCS at Fort Benning is an intensive 12-week course whose graduates are commissioned in one of 16 basic branches. Army National Guard OCS is also conducted by most of the 54 states and territories under the accreditation and approved curriculum of the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, just as is the federal OCS. Upon graduation, candidates are commissioned as Army second lieutenants and proceed to the Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) for their branch. Army aviator requirements for OCS graduates are the same as for ROTC.</p>
<p class="indent">Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS) is an intensive six-week course conducted at Fort Rucker, Alabama. Only candidates preselected for follow-on aviator duty can enter WOCS without significant prior military experience in a particular field (e.g., logistics, personnel, ordnance, etc.). Graduates are appointed a Warrant Officer One and proceed to their warrant officer basic course.</p>
<p class="indent">Army flight training, both basic and advanced, is conducted for both commissioned and warrant officers at Fort Rucker. Initial training of an Army aviator, whether commissioned or warrant officer, can take up to a year before assignment to an operational unit.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2388" href="#calibre_link-2479" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">U.S. Navy and Marine Corps</span></a></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw1" src="images/00425.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">There are four pathways to becoming a Naval or Marine officer: the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA), Naval ROTC, Navy OCS, and the Marine Corps’ Platoon Leaders’ Course (PLC) and Officer Candidate Course (OCC).</p>
<p class="indent">Like the other services, the U.S. Navy operates its own service academy, this one at Annapolis, Maryland, established in 1845. USNA midshipmen include prospective Marine officers, since the Marine Corps is part of the Department of the Navy. The Naval Academy provides the Navy and Marine Corps with more than a thousand new officers annually.</p>
<p class="indent">Likewise, Navy ROTC is offered at more than 150 colleges and universities nationwide. It is organized much as the other services’ programs, with the exception that Marine Option cadets normally have extra training activities. NROTC is the largest single source of Navy and Marine Corps officers.</p>
<p class="indent">Navy OCS is one of five officer training schools located at Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island. The 12-week course not only assesses candidates to see if they have what it takes, but gives them a working knowledge of the Navy afloat and ashore, preparing them to assume the responsibilities of a naval officer. Graduates of Navy OCS are commissioned as ensigns and attend technical training before reporting to their first fleet assignment.</p>
<p class="indent">The Marine Corps’ PLC is designed for college students who have not yet received their degree, splitting up their training into two six-week summer training courses. OCC candidates have already received their bachelor’s degree, and so undergo a rigorous 10-week training and evaluation that focuses on military and leadership tasks, rapid absorption of military knowledge, physical training, and functioning under sleep deprivation. Graduates of both courses are commissioned as Marine second lieutenants and attend another six months of demanding instruction at The Basic School (TBS), where (regardless of their eventual specialty) they will learn to become Marine infantry platoon commanders. After completion <a id="calibre_link-2855" class="calibre3"></a>of TBS, they proceed to technical schools for their particular specialty, and from there to the field and fleet.</p>
<p class="indent">To become a naval or Marine aviator, you must be between the ages of 19 and 27 at the time you apply for flight training. Waivers of up to 24 months can be made on a month-for-month basis for those with prior active duty military service, up to a maximum age of 29. The standards are the same for naval flight officers (such as Radar Intercept Officers or RIOs), except NFOs may be granted a waiver of up to 48 months for active duty served before their 27th birthday&mdash;again on a month-for-month basis&mdash;to a maximum age of 31.</p>
<p class="indent">Naval flight officers in both the Navy and Marine Corps are not pilots, but they undergo much of the same training. They perform many “copilot” functions in aircraft with multi-person crews, specializing in airborne weapons and sensor systems. They are by no means “second fiddle,” however&mdash;they can serve as tactical mission commanders (although the pilot in command, regardless of rank, is always responsible for the safe piloting of the aircraft) of single or multiple air assets during a particular mission.</p>
<p class="indent">The pilot training program for new naval aviators takes 18 months altogether to complete. All students undergo common training at Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, where they are screened for one of three primary pipelines: helicopters, multi-engine propeller aircraft, or strike warfare (jets). Upon completion of training at Pensacola, Student Naval Aviators (SNAs) enter their primary training pipelines, where they learn the basics of flying.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2389" href="#calibre_link-2480" class="calibre5">U.S. Coast Guard</a></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw1" src="images/00425.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Coast Guard officers receive their commissions as ensigns from either the U.S. Coast Guard Academy or Coast Guard OCS, both of which are located in New London, Connecticut. The Coast Guard also has the College Student Pre-Commissioning Initiative (CSPI) available to students at about 400 campuses that are classified as historically black colleges and universities; Hispanic-serving institutions; and tribal colleges or universities; plus six campuses in Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam. This is essentially a scholarship for the last two years of the participant’s college time, with active duty E-3 pay, full tuition, some fees, and some book costs, but it also requires completion of Coast Guard basic training and participation in various training events during that period. After graduation comes Coast Guard OCS and then commissioning.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of commissioning source, newly commissioned Coast Guard ensigns are then integrated into the Navy’s flight training program as appropriate for the kind of aircraft they will fly for the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard also directly commissions people with prior Department of Defense (DoD) flight experience in its Direct Commission Aviator program.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="dc">M</span>ilitary aircraft exist to perform one or more of four basic functions: <span class="italic">transporting</span> people and/or things from one place to another; <span class="italic">bombing</span> enemy forces or facilities on the ground, or ships at sea; <span class="italic">shooting</span>, either at enemy aircraft in the air or at enemies on the surface; or <span class="italic">observing</span> enemy actions and reporting them to other friendly forces.</p>
<p class="indent">In most cases, military aircraft operate at some level in support of surface (ground or sea) forces, since the only way to control what’s happening on the surface for more than a short time is to <span class="italic">be</span> there. Or, said another way, ground units and air units often work together to accomplish the mission at hand.</p>
<p class="indent">Military aircraft can be divided into two general categories: <span class="italic">fixed-wing</span> aircraft, commonly referred to as <span class="italic">airplane</span><span class="italic">s</span>; and <span class="italic">rotary-wing</span> aircraft, usually referred to as <span class="italic">helicopters</span>.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2391" href="#calibre_link-2483" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">OVERVIEW OF FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Fixed-wing aircraft are just that&mdash;their wings are “fixed,” meaning that they don’t move. These aircraft get their ability to fly (a quality called <span class="italic">lif</span><span class="italic">t</span>) from air passing over their wings, and are usually either pulled through the air by a corkscrew-type propeller or pushed through the air by the thrust from one or more jet engines.</p>
<p class="indent">American fixed-wing military aircraft are referred to by an alphanumeric system that consists of three parts and a given name. The first part, which consists of one or two letters, refers to the function of the airplane. If there are two letters, the first letter indicates a modification of the aircraft’s basic mission, which is indicated by the second letter. Here are some of the most common designators:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="hang">A&mdash;Attack</p>
<p class="hang">B&mdash;Bomber</p>
<p class="hang">C&mdash;Cargo/transport</p>
<p class="hang2-1a">AC&mdash; Cargo plane modified to perform an attack mission</p>
<p class="hang2-1a">KC&mdash; Cargo plane modified to perform an aerial refueling mission</p>
<p class="hang">E&mdash;Special electronics</p>
<p class="hang">F&mdash;Fighter</p>
<p class="hang2-1a">F/A&mdash;Fighter/attack</p>
<p class="hang">O&mdash;Observation</p>
<p class="hang">P&mdash;Patrol (maritime)</p>
<p class="hang">Q&mdash;Unmanned aerial vehicle</p>
<p class="hang">R&mdash;Reconnaissance</p>
<p class="hang">S&mdash;Antisubmarine</p>
<p class="hang">T&mdash;Trainer</p>
<p class="hang">U&mdash;Utility</p>
<p class="hang">V&mdash;Vertical takeoff and/or landing</p>
<p class="hang">X&mdash;Experimental/test</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2857" class="calibre3"></a>The second part of the designation is the model or sequence number, which, in combination with the functional designation, gives you the series designation. A letter that follows the sequence number denotes the exact model or version; successive letters designate upgrades, modifications, or improvements. Thus, we can tell that an F/A-18C is a fighter of the F/A-18 series, and that it is a later or modified (or at least different) version from an F/A-18A.</p>
<p class="indent">For ease of reference (and it doesn’t hurt crew morale, either), American military aircraft are also given a name of some sort, usually one that relates to its mission, warlike qualities, or special characteristics. Thus, we have the F-117 Nighthawk, a stealthy fighter named after a bird of prey; the heavily armed B-52 Stratofortress; the EA-6B Prowler reconnaissance plane&mdash;even the A-10 Thunderbolt II, nicknamed the “Warthog,” not much to look at, but without question rugged and powerful.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2392" href="#calibre_link-2484" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">OVERVIEW OF ROTARY-WING AIRCRAFT</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Rotary-wing aircraft don’t have wings in the same sense as fixed-wing aircraft. They get their lift from air passing over rotor blades that are spun around at high speed in a circle by an engine; the tilt of the rotors relative to the helicopter’s body or fuselage governs the aircraft’s movement forward and backward, left and right, up and down. A notable difference between rotary- and fixed-wing aircraft is that rotary-wing craft can <span class="italic">hover</span>&mdash;stay aloft over just one spot.</p>
<p class="indent">The inside joke at some rotary-wing aviator schools is, “A helicopter doesn’t fly&mdash;it beats the air into submission.” A helicopter does not have the same stable tendencies while in flight that a well-designed conventional airplane does. It maintains its altitude and flight by a variety of forces and controls that are actually working in opposition to each other; the pilot’s job is to balance (or nearly balance) these forces for the helicopter to go where he wants it to go.</p>
<p class="indent">By worldwide convention, helicopters are categorized by maximum gross weight (aircraft, fuel, crew, equipment, weapons, and so on&mdash;the most weight with which the aircraft can take off under normal conditions): “light,” “medium lift,” and “heavy lift.” Light helicopters are generally considered to be those below 12,000 lbs. Medium-lift helicopters are those that weigh from about 14,000 to 45,000 lbs., and heavy-lift helicopters are usually considered to be those that weigh more than 50,000 lbs. Some in the field reserve the <span class="italic">heavy-lift</span> term for the very largest copters&mdash;above 80,000 lbs. The exact amount of load a helicopter can carry depends on the model, the fuel on board, the exact distance to be flown, and atmospheric conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">U.S. military helicopters are designated by a system that has three alphanumeric parts and a given name. The first part, which consists of letters, refers to the function of the helicopter. Here are some of the most common designations:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="hang2-1a">AH&mdash;attack helicopter</p>
<p class="hang2-1a">CH&mdash;cargo helicopter</p>
<p class="hang2-1a">HH&mdash; heavy-lift and large rescue helicopters not otherwise classified</p>
<p class="hang2-1a">MH&mdash;modified for special operations</p>
<p class="hang2-1a">OH&mdash; observation, reconnaissance, and courier</p>
<p class="hang2-1a">SH&mdash; antisubmarine warfare (ASW) helicopter</p>
<p class="hang2-1a">UH&mdash; utility/general purpose; can move internal or external (“sling”) loads</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2858" class="calibre3"></a>The second part of the designation is the model or sequence number, which, when put together with the functional designation, yields the series designation. A letter that follows the sequence number denotes the exact model or version; successive letters designate upgrades, modifications, and/or improvements. Thus, we can tell that a UH-60L is a utility helicopter of the UH-60 series, and that it is a later or modified version following a UH-60A.</p>
<p class="indent">Most Army helicopters are named after Native American tribes (such as Blackhawk, Apache, and Iroquois). Most Navy and Marine Corps helicopters have a maritime reference in their names, such as Sea Hawk, Sea Knight, and so on.</p>

<p class="noindent">This section will acquaint you with some of the most common aircraft used by the U.S. military today. There are many more types and variations of U.S. military aircraft than what can be included in this book. This section will give you an idea of the most common U.S. military aircraft types, capabilities, and missions&mdash;<span class="italic">which will prepare you with context and background for the Aviation Information subtests in all three services’ flight aptitude tests.</span> See the section titled “Aviation Information” in <a href="#calibre_link-2486" class="calibre3">Chapter 7</a> for more technical information.</p>

<p class="h2"><span class="bold">A-10 THUNDERBOLT II</span></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00451.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The A-10 Thunderbolt II is the first USAF aircraft to be specifically designed for providing close air support to ground forces. It has excellent maneuverability at low speeds and low altitude and is a rugged, highly accurate weapons platform. It can remain near battle areas for extended time periods and operate in low visibility and bad weather conditions. The pilot and parts of the flight control system are protected by titanium armor that can take direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles. Its 30 mm seven-barrel Gatling gun, mounted in the fuselage and protruding under the nose, has given it a well-deserved reputation as a premier tank buster.</p>
<p class="indent">The Thunderbolt II&mdash;lovingly nicknamed the “Warthog”&mdash;has received many small and large upgrades since it was first introduced in 1975; the entire fleet is now designated as the A-10C. It has come close to being retired more than once, but the lack of a replacement with truly equivalent capabilities has kept it in the USAF inventory. Current plans call for it to remain in service until at least 2021.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">AC-130U SPOOKY</span></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00451.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The primary missions for the AC-130U Spooky gunship are close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance. Close air support missions include supporting ground troops in contact with the enemy, convoy escort/overwatch, and point air defense. Air interdiction missions are conducted against preplanned targets or targets of opportunity and include strike coordination, reconnaissance, and armed overwatch missions.</p>
<p class="indent">The heavily armed AC-130U incorporates side-firing heavy weapons integrated with sophisticated sensor, navigation, and fire control systems to provide surgically accurate firepower on a particular point or saturation of a larger area, even over extended periods, at night, and in bad weather.</p>

<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00532.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The AV-8B Harrier V/STOL (Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing) strike aircraft has unique capabilities that allow it to operate from a variety of places inaccessible to other fixed-wing aircraft&mdash;such as amphibious ships, rapidly constructed expeditionary airfields, roads, forward area refueling points (FARPs), and damaged conventional airfields&mdash;while also being able to operate from aircraft carriers and conventional land-based airfields.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2395" href="#calibre_link-2488" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">Bombers</span></a></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">B-1B LANCER</span></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00451.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The B-1B is a stealthy, multi-role, swing-wing, long-range supersonic bomber, capable of flying a variety of conventional missions for intercontinental distances without refueling, penetrating both present and predicted enemy air defenses. Although smaller than the B-52 it was designed to replace, it carries more weapons and has only one-tenth the radar signature. The B-1B’s electronic jamming equipment, infrared countermeasures, and radar warning systems add to its low-radar cross-section to greatly increase its survivability.</p>
<p class="indent">Although originally designed as a nuclear-capable bomber, the “New START” (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreement with Russia in 2011 called for the attachment points and the control electronics for nuclear weapons to be uninstalled. Once a year, Russian officials <a id="calibre_link-2861" class="calibre3"></a>are granted access to the appropriate USAF bases for an inspection to ensure that the Air Force’s fastest bomber is still unable to carry nuclear weapons. Even so, carrying the largest conventional payload of either guided or unguided weapons in the Air Force inventory, the B-1B Lancer is currently expected to remain in service until at least 2040.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">B-2 SPIRIT</span></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00451.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The B-2 Spirit is a multi-role stealth bomber capable of delivering conventional (including precision-guided standoff) and nuclear munitions. The combination of low-observable technologies with high aerodynamic efficiency and a large payload capacity gives the B-2 important advantages over other existing bombers. Its unique design and construction gives the B-2 its “stealth”&mdash;very low observability by sight, hearing, radar, or infrared sensors.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">B-52H STRATOFORTRESS</span></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00451.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The B-52 series “BUFF” (translated in polite company as “Big Ugly Fat Fellow”) is a long-range heavy bomber that can perform a variety of missions. Capable of high subsonic speeds at up to 50,000 ft. (15,240 m), it can conduct aerial refueling and carry nuclear or precision-guided conventional ordnance worldwide.</p>

<p class="h2"><span class="bold">C-2A GREYHOUND</span></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00631.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The C-2A Greyhound, a twin-engine cargo aircraft designed to land on aircraft carriers, provides critical onboard delivery of passengers and cargo to the Navy’s aircraft carriers. The cabin can readily accommodate cargo, passengers, or both; it is also equipped to accept litter patients for medical evacuation missions.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">C-17 GLOBEMASTER III</span></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00451.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The C-17 is capable of rapid strategic delivery of troops and all types of cargo to main operating bases or directly to forward bases in theater. It is also able to perform tactical airlift and airdrop missions (up to 102 troops), and it can transport 36 litters and 54 ambulatory patients with attendants during aeromedical evacuations. When configured with palletized airliner-style seats, it can carry up to 188 passengers. Alternatively, the C-17 can carry one M1-series Abrams tank, up to three Bradley armored vehicles, up to three Stryker infantry fighting vehicles, or two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">C-130 HERCULES</span></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00451.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The C-130 Hercules’s primary role is the intratheater (within theater) portion of the Air Force’s airlift mission. The “Herc” or “Herky Bird” can operate from rough dirt strips and is the prime transport for dropping or airlanding parachute troops and equipment into hostile areas. Basic and specialized versions accomplish a wide range of missions, including cargo and passenger airlift, Antarctic ice mission resupply, aeromedical missions, aerial spray missions, and firefighting duties for the U.S. Forest Service.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the C-130A began service in 1956, upgrades to engines, avionics, and propellers, along with added external fuel tanks, have kept successive B, E, H, and J models as familiar sights to U.S. forces around the world. The USAF, the USN, and the USMC are well on their way to replacing their C-130Es and C-130Hs with J models, including some of the C-130J-30 “stretch” variants with a 15-foot fuselage extension and the resulting additional payload capacity.</p>

<p class="noindent">The F-15 Eagle is an extremely maneuverable all-weather tactical fighter designed to gain and maintain aerial combat superiority through a combination of superior maneuverability, acceleration, range, weapons, and avionics. Although originally designed as a pure air superiority fighter, the F-15’s superior performance characteristics resulted in the development of a ground attack variant, the Strike Eagle. Continuing upgrades of engines, avionics, radar, pilot interface systems, electronic countermeasures, fuel capacity, and munitions racks have kept the Eagle in production since it first entered service in 1976, and they are expected to keep the Eagle relevant and ready through about 2040.</p>

<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00451.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The F-16 Fighting Falcon, also known as the “Viper” by its pilots, is a relatively small, highly maneuverable multi-role fighter proven in both air-to-air and air-to-surface roles. In its air combat role, the F-16 can locate targets in all weather conditions and sort out low-flying aircraft from radar ground clutter. In its air-to-surface role, the F-16 can fly more than 500 miles (860 km), deliver its munitions with superior accuracy under any weather conditions, defend itself against enemy aircraft, and return to its starting point.</p>

<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00765.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The F/A-18 Hornet/Super Hornet series is a twin-engine, twin-tail, midwing, all-weather fighter and attack aircraft used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. It can perform traditional strike missions, such as interdiction and close air support, without compromising its fighter capabilities. In its fighter role, the F/A-18 is used primarily for fleet air defense and fighter escort; in its attack role, it is used for interdiction, force protection, and close and deep air support missions.</p>
<p class="indent">The Navy is far along with replacing its F/A-18C and D model Hornets with the larger and more capable Super Hornet, while the Marine Corps has begun replacing its Hornets with the Short Take-off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) F-35B Lightning II. However, since this will take years to accomplish, the USMC plans to keep using F/A-18C and D model Hornets well into the 2020s.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">F-22 RAPTOR</span></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00451.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The F-22 Raptor is the U.S. Air Force’s newest air superiority fighter. The fifth-generation aircraft’s stealth, maneuverability, advanced sensors, supercruise capability (sustained supersonic flight without using afterburners), integrated avionics, and improved supportability are on the leading edge of warfighting capabilities worldwide. It is designed to penetrate enemy airspace and achieve a “first-look, first-kill” dominance against multiple targets.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-head"><a id="calibre_link-2868" class="calibre5"></a><span class="bold1">FIFTH-GENERATION AIRCRAFT</span></p>
<p class="bnoindent">Jet fighters are currently classified in five generations. The first generation consisted of early subsonic jets from World War II through the Korean War; the second incorporated lessons learned from the first and was capable of supersonic flight. Third-generation fighters were mostly shaped by Cold War competition with the Soviet Union and Vietnam combat experience and included increased use of air-to-air missiles and ground-to-air missile defense. Many fourth-generation fighters are still in service around the world, although recent upgrades of some aircraft are so improved that they are often called “generation 4.5.”</p>
<p class="bindent">Fifth-generation fighters are characterized by their inherent stealth; advanced airframe, maneuverability, avionics, and propulsion; and compatibility with a network-centric operational approach. Fifth-generation aircraft can direct strikes by any air, ground, or seagoing assets within range of a target, vastly increasing the effectiveness of military forces in an operational area.</p>

<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00451.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw2" src="images/00765.jpeg" width="250" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The F-35 Lightning II is a family of fifth-generation, single-seat, single-engine, stealth multi-role fighters. Unlike most aircraft, from which successive versions evolve over time, the F-35 was initially designed with three versions to meet the needs of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Unlike the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 was intended from the beginning to be available for export to close U.S. allies and partners.</p>
<p class="indent">All three versions have the same fuselage and internal weapons bay, common outer lines with similar structural geometry, an identical angle of wing sweep, and comparable tail shapes. The avionics, radar, ejection system, and most subsystems are common to all versions, as is the core engine.</p>
<p class="indent">The F-35A is the USAF version, designed for conventional takeoff and landing; it is the only version with an internal cannon. Although still an advanced fifth-generation fighter, it is the smallest and lightest of the three, as well as the least complex, in that it does not require hover or aircraft carrier launching and landing capability.</p>
<p class="indent">The F-35B is the STOVL variant designed for the USMC. It sacrifices some of the F-35A’s fuel capacity to accommodate a vertical flight system that swivels an exhaust nozzle, directing thrust downward. Although this makes it useable aboard Navy aircraft carriers, it is not equipped for conventional carrier catapult launches or arresting hook landings.</p>
<p class="indent">The F-35C is the Navy’s carrier-capable version, featuring larger wings with foldable wingtip sections; larger wing and tail control surfaces for improved low-speed control; stronger landing gear to withstand carrier arresting hook landings; and a tailhook designed for use with a carrier’s arrestor cables. The larger wing area increases range and payload while allowing lower landing speeds.</p>

<p class="noindent">The P-3C Orion is a land-based, long-range antisubmarine warfare (ASW) patrol aircraft. The avionics system integrates all tactical displays and monitors, coordinates navigation information, and accepts sensor inputs for tactical display and storage; it can also automatically launch ordnance and provide flight information to the pilots.</p>

<p class="noindent">The P-8A Poseidon, based on Boeing’s 737 airframe, is the Navy’s newest maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, a multi-mission replacement in the process of replacing the P-3 Orion. Its open-architecture mission system facilitates planned upgrades, its accomplishment of anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare missions, and its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) efforts.</p>

<p class="noindent">The V-22 Osprey is a multi-service, multi-role combat aircraft that uses tilt-rotor technology to combine the vertical performance of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing aircraft. With its rotors in the vertical position, it can take off, land, and hover like a helicopter&mdash;but once airborne, it can convert to a turboprop airplane for high-speed, high-altitude flight.</p>

<p class="noindent">The USAF KC-10 Extender tanker/cargo aircraft is a modified DC-10 commercial airliner, providing increased mobility for U.S. forces in contingency operations, without dependence on overseas bases and without depleting critical fuel supplies overseas. The KC-10 fleet provides in-flight refueling worldwide to aircraft from all branches of the U.S. armed forces, as well as those of other coalition forces. Equipped with its own refueling receptacle, the KC-10A can support deployment of fighters, fighter support aircraft, and cargo aircraft from U.S. bases to any area in the world.</p>

<p class="noindent">The CH-47 is a twin-engine, tandem-rotor helicopter designed for transportation of cargo, troops, and weapons during all conditions. Development of the medium-lift Boeing Vertol CH-47 Series Chinook began in 1956. Since then the effectiveness of the Chinook has been continually upgraded by successive product improvements&mdash;the CH-47A, CH-47B, CH-47C, and CH-47D, and now the MH-47E.</p>

<p class="noindent">The CH-53E Sea Stallion transports equipment, supplies, and personnel during the assault phase of a Marine amphibious operation, as well as follow-on operations ashore. Capable of carrying supplies both internally and externally, the CH-53E is compatible with shipboard operations and can operate in adverse weather conditions day and night.</p>

Although it is based on a Eurocopter design, it is built in the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">Active matrix liquid crystal cockpit displays simplify flight and airframe information, increasing the crew’s situational awareness and reducing the pilot’s workload. The main and tail rotors are set high to allow fast but safe loading and unloading through both main and rear doors, even while the rotors are still turning. For medical missions the Lakota’s cabin can accommodate two stretchers plus one medical attendant and a crew chief to operate the external electric hoist. Otherwise, foldup cabin seats can accommodate eight troops or passengers.</p>

<p class="images"><img class="zw3" src="images/00376.jpeg" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="drop">T</span>he Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) measures aptitudes used by the U.S. Air Force to select candidates for officer commissioning programs and specific officer training programs. Last revised in 2014, it consists of 12 timed subtests. The scores from the individual subtests are combined in different ways to generate seven composite scores used to help predict success in selected USAF training programs.</p>
<p class="indent">The AFOQT Form T incorporates several significant changes from the previous version, based on feedback from an Air Force&ndash;wide survey where officers identified abilities and aptitudes they considered critical for effectiveness as an officer. These changes included:</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span>Adding the Reading Comprehension subtest, which contributes to the test-taker’s Verbal and Academic Aptitude composite scores. This subtest uses the type of information test-takers will see in USAF professional military education courses</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>Adding the Situational Judgment subtest to evaluate the test-taker’s judgment when responding to the types of situations often encountered by officers</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>Renaming the General Science subtest the “Physical Science” subtest, with a correspondingly revised focus</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>Updating the graphics on the Instrument Comprehension subtest and increasing the number of questions from 20 to 25</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>Deleting the Rotated Blocks and Hidden Figures subtests</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>Increasing the number of questions on the Block Counting subtest from 20 to 30</p>
<p class="bll"><span class="tcn">■</span>Updating test questions throughout the AFOQT</p>
<p class="indent">The seven composite scores and the kinds of abilities and knowledge they measure are as follows:</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">1.</span> PILOT</span> This composite score measures some of the knowledge and abilities the Air Force considers necessary for successful completion of manned and unmanned pilot training. The Pilot composite includes subtests that measure quantitative ability, aeronautical concepts knowledge, ability to determine aircraft attitude from instruments, and perceptual speed (how fast the test-taker can figure things out). This composite score is used in combination with results from the Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS) and any previous flying hours to determine your overall Pilot Candidate Selection Method (PCSM) score.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">2.</span> COMBAT SYSTEMS OFFICER (CSO)</span> This composite score (previously called “Navigator-Technical”) measures some of the abilities and knowledge considered necessary for <a id="calibre_link-2886" class="calibre3"></a>successful completion of CSO training. It shares some subtests with the Pilot composite, but tests that measure aeronautical knowledge and the ability to determine aircraft attitude from instruments are not included. However, additional subtests measure verbal aptitude and spatial abilities.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">3.</span> AIR BATTLE MANAGER (ABM)</span> This composite measures some of the knowledge and abilities considered necessary for successful completion of ABM training. It shares some subtests with the Pilot composite, including measures of the ability to determine aircraft attitude, knowledge of aeronautical concepts, perceptual speed, and quantitative ability. However, like the CSO composite, it also includes subtests that measure verbal aptitude and spatial abilities.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">4.</span> ACADEMIC APTITUDE</span> The Academic Aptitude composite measures verbal and quantitative abilities and knowledge. It is derived from all the subtests that make up the Verbal and Quantitative composites.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">5.</span> VERBAL</span> The Verbal composite measures verbal knowledge and abilities using subtests that measure the ability to reason, make inferences (conclusions), recognize relationships between words, and understand synonyms and antonyms.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">6.</span> QUANTITATIVE</span> This composite measures math-related abilities and knowledge. It shares subtests with the CSO composite and includes subtests that measure the test-taker’s ability to understand and reason with mathematical relationships, as well as using mathematical terms, formulas, and relationships.</p>
<p class="bll"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">7.</span> SITUATIONAL JUDGMENT</span> This composite measures judgment and decision-making abilities when responding to the types of interpersonal situations often encountered by junior USAF officers. Test questions are based on real scenarios experienced by junior officers and require core competencies of integrity and professionalism, leadership, resource management, communication, innovation, and mentoring. Test questions are selected based on statistical score relationships to cadets’ results in USAF Basic Officer Training and Field Training. Answers are scored based on the consensus judgment of a sample of identified high-potential USAF officers.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00705.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre18" /></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="calibre_link-2887" class="calibre3"></a>As you can see, that’s a lot of time in the testing facility. When you count the time scheduled for administrative instructions, passing out materials, collecting materials, and so on, you will be there for almost five hours. Don’t worry&mdash;there are two breaks totaling 25 minutes, so it’s nothing you can’t handle. However, as you can see, some of the subtests don’t allow you much time, so you will have to know your stuff before you go in. That’s where this book will help, if you study the subjects thoroughly and take the practice tests seriously.</p>
<p class="indent">Everyone who wants to become an Air Force officer of any type must take the AFOQT. The three USAF commissioning sources&mdash;the U.S. Air Force Academy, Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC), and Officer Training School (OTS)&mdash;initially consider only the applicant’s Verbal and Quantitative composite scores, so you could say that these parts of the AFOQT are the first gateway through which a prospective Air Force officer must pass. The three commissioning sources maintain their own standards for entry, which can and do change based on the needs of the Air Force at that time. It is only after an applicant gains entry to a commissioning program that further evaluation of other AFOQT composite scores determines the candidate’s eligibility for Pilot, CSO, ABM, or other nonflying specialty areas.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s important to achieve the best initial score possible on the AFOQT because the scores are valid for life and applicants may only take the test twice (one original and one retest at least 180 days later). Additional retests are sometimes allowed, but they require a waiver which is not guaranteed. Only the latest scores&mdash;not necessarily the highest&mdash;are used in selection consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">The TBAS is a computerized “psychomotor” test (eye/hand coordination and mental skills) used in conjunction with the AFOQT to predict levels of potential success in basic pilot training. It consists of nine subtests that either introduce a new skill area or test a combination of previous skill areas. The TBAS subtests are:</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">DIRECTIONAL ORIENTATION TEST</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This 48-question subtest measures spatial orientation abilities. You must determine the position of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relative to a target. The computer screen displays a “tracker map” showing the UAV’s direction of travel (heading) and location; it also shows another display representing what a fixed, forward-facing UAV camera would “see” when pointed at a single building surrounded by four parking lots. What you have to do is click on the correct parking lot based on computer-generated voice instructions. The trick is that, while the tracker map is always oriented with north at the top, the UAV camera view may not be. Your score is based on both the accuracy and speed of your responses.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3-DIGIT AND 5-DIGIT LISTENING TESTS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Through headphones, you will hear a series of letters and numbers, and you must then squeeze the trigger when you hear any of three or five specified numbers. Each test lasts about three minutes.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">HORIZONTAL TRACKING TEST (HTT)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Using foot pedals resembling an airplane’s rudder pedals, your task is to keep a box on the computer screen superimposed over an airplane symbol as it moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen. The airplane moves at a constant speed and changes direction when it reaches the side of the screen or if you successfully target it for a certain number of seconds. <a id="calibre_link-2888" class="calibre3"></a>The task lasts three minutes and the speed of the airplane (and therefore the level of difficulty) increases as the subtest goes on.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">AIRPLANE TRACKING TEST (ATT)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Using a joystick, your task here is to keep the gunsight crosshairs on an airplane symbol as it moves around the computer screen at a constant speed. The airplane randomly changes direction when it reaches the side of the screen or if the test-taker successfully targets it for a certain number of seconds.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">AIRPLANE AND HORIZONTAL TRACKING TEST</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This subtest requires you to perform two previously tested tasks at the same time. First, you have to track an airplane using foot pedals as it moves horizontally along a strip at the bottom of the screen (as in the HTT). At the same time, though, you must track another airplane moving in two dimensions, as you did in the ATT.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">ATT, HTT, AND LISTENING TESTS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This test requires you to perform three previously tested tasks simultaneously. First, you must track an airplane moving horizontally as you did in the HTT. Second, you simultaneously track an airplane moving in two dimensions as you did in the ATT. Third, while performing the first two tasks, you press the joystick trigger when you hear any of the three or five specified target numbers (one test using three numbers, and the next using five numbers).</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">EMERGENCY SCENARIO TEST</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Simultaneously, you perform the horizontal tracking task and the airplane tracking task&mdash;then you are presented with three emergency scenarios (one at a time) that you have to cancel out by typing a code on the keyboard. You’ll have eight minutes to read the instructions and memorize the three emergency situations and the correct response code for each of the three situations. Your test starts with both a verbal announcement in your headphones and the word <span class="italic">emergency</span> moving along the top of the screen. The difficulty of this subtest increases with the number of times you get it right. Approximate duration is three minutes.</p>
<p class="images"><img class="zw3" src="images/00407.jpeg" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2407" href="#calibre_link-2501" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">Army Selection Instrument for Flight Training (SIFT)</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The Selection Instrument for Flight Training (SIFT) is a battery of seven computerized tests measuring multiple aptitudes; it replaced the Army Flight Aptitude Selection Test (AFAST) in 2013. It is not an intelligence test. Unlike the AFAST, there is no paper version; the SIFT is only available on the Automated Pilot Exam (<a href="http://APEX.NET" class="calibre3">APEX.NET</a>) platform&mdash;a web-based format operated on a secure server that’s monitored and controlled.</p>
<p class="indent">Also, two of the seven subtests are adaptive. We’ll talk more about that shortly.</p>
<p class="indent">Your SIFT score is your ticket to Army Aviation training. You are only allowed to take the SIFT twice in your lifetime, and the first time you achieve a passing SIFT score, you’re done&mdash;there is no chance to take it over and try to improve your score. If you fail the SIFT twice, you will not be able to take the test again. This book will help you ensure that your SIFT score is the best it can be the first time.</p>
<p class="indent">The SIFT assesses math skills and abilities, the ability to understand the meaning of written passages, familiarity with mechanical concepts and simple machines, the ability to perform <a id="calibre_link-2889" class="calibre3"></a>mental rotations of a depicted object, and the ability to quickly recognize patterns. The SIFT also measures the test-taker’s<span class="normal" lang="ar-SA">&nbsp;knowledge of aviation terminology, familiarity with aircraft components and functions, knowledge of basic aer</span>odynamic principles, and knowledge of basic flight rules and regulations. Since most Army aviation is rotary-wing (i.e., helicopters), you need to be just as familiar with helicopters as you are with airplanes.</p>
<p class="indent">All the SIFT components have already proven to be excellent predictors of flight training performance. The SIFT identifies individuals who already have a high level of the mental “right stuff” as well as some background knowledge of aviation concepts&mdash;those are the people most likely to make it through flight training.</p>
<p class="indent">The total time needed to take the SIFT will vary for different test-takers, but usually runs about two and a half hours, including registration and a 15-minute break.</p>
<p class="indent">This is how the SIFT is organized:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00753.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre18" /></p>
<p class="indent">Because the subtests are different, there are different strategies and techniques needed to do your best:</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">SIMPLE DRAWINGS (SD)<br class="calibre2" />HIDDEN FIGURES (HF)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Recommendation: <span class="bold">Work quickly and <span class="underline">don’t</span> guess.</span> The SD and HF scores are taken from the number of problems you answered correctly, with incorrect answers deducted from your score. Most of the time, test-takers will not be able to get through all the questions. Answering as quickly and as accurately as possible&mdash;without randomly guessing as time is about to expire&mdash;is usually the best technique.</p>
<p class="indent">Time yourself when you practice these subtests in this book. It will not only help get you into the rhythm of these kinds of problems, but it will also give you some pretest confidence.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">ARMY AVIATION INFORMATION TEST (AAIT)<br class="calibre2" />SPATIAL APPERCEPTION TEST (SAT)<br class="calibre2" />READING COMPREHENSION TEST (RCT)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Recommendation: <span class="bold">Work quickly and <span class="underline">guess</span> on questions you haven’t reached if time is about to run out.</span> The AAIT, SAT, and RCT include a fixed number of questions for each subtest. On these subtests, any questions left unanswered will be graded as incorrect. Therefore, <a id="calibre_link-2890" class="calibre3"></a>if time is about to expire, it’s in your best interest to rule out poor answer choices on the remaining questions and make educated guesses.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, it will be helpful to you to practice these subtests in this book while timing yourself&mdash;and you can definitely improve your AAIT score by studying the Aviation Information section in <a href="#calibre_link-2486" class="calibre3">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">MATH SKILLS TEST (MST)<br class="calibre2" />MECHANICAL COMPREHENSION TEST (MCT)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Recommendation: <span class="bold">Work quickly and <span class="underline">don’t</span> guess.</span> Both of these subtests are <span class="italic">adaptive</span>, which means the computer program tailors questions to the ability level of each examinee. In a paper test (and in the first five SIFT subtests, even though they are on the computer), all test-takers answer the same questions; this has the advantage of measuring everyone with the same yardstick, but there is no flexibility in that yardstick.</p>
<p class="indent">In an adaptive test, your first question will be in the middle range of difficulty. If you answer it correctly, the next question will be more difficult. Answer that one correctly, and the questions will get harder until you miss one, at which time it will ask you a less challenging question. If you don’t answer the first question correctly, however, the next item will be less difficult. The test continues in this way until your proficiency level is determined in each area. You answer questions that are appropriate for your ability level, so you don’t waste time answering questions that are either too easy or too hard&mdash;therefore, there are fewer questions and less time needed in each section.</p>
<p class="indent">Due to the nature of adaptive tests, there is a lower limit to the validity of the test when too few questions get answered&mdash;so test-takers who don’t answer enough questions on either of the SIFT’s adaptive subtests before time runs out may have a penalty applied to their scores. Therefore, examinees need to work as quickly as possible without losing accuracy. The size of the penalty will increase as the number of questions answered decreases, but there will not be a penalty if the test ends automatically before time has expired.</p>
<p class="indent">Many test-takers find that they need to put special emphasis on reviewing their math knowledge and skills before taking any of the services’ flight aptitude tests. Unless you were a whiz in physics in school (and even if you were), you will benefit a lot from reviewing the Mechanical Comprehension section in <a href="#calibre_link-2502" class="calibre3">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">On the adaptive subtests, it’s not a good idea to start randomly guessing as time is about to run out. The time limits for each subtest have been established to allow as many examinees as possible to finish the test. If you have worked diligently and quickly on a particular subtest, random guessing will in most cases be worse for your score than the penalty you might get for not finishing the entire test.</p>
<p class="indent">The advantages of adaptive tests are that they take less time and you don’t have to wait to go on to the next subtest&mdash;even on the subtests that are not adaptive, you should be able to go to the next subtest when you are ready, and not have to wait on everyone else. Since the overall test is computerized, you will get your scores as soon as you finish the entire SIFT&mdash;but you can’t skip around, and you can’t go back to a question you already answered.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">SIFT SCORES AND SCORING</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Your pass/fail results will be generated as soon as you finish the SIFT. You will be instructed to see the Test Control Officer (TCO) or Test Examiner (TE) to get your score letter, which must be signed by the TCO or TE to be valid.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2891" class="calibre3"></a>If you pass the SIFT, you are not authorized to retake it. If you don’t make the cut score on your first try, you can retake the SIFT, but only once&mdash;and you have to wait at least 180 days (six months). You only get ONE retest. Let me say that again: you get a <span class="italic">maximum</span> of two chances to take the SIFT. That’s it.</p>
<p class="indent">As of this writing, the minimum qualifying score to apply for the Army’s Aviation Program is 40. Possible scores range from 20 to 80; 50 is considered an “average” score. The cutoff score may change to match the needs of the Army’s Aviation Branch and Recruiting Command. The education center on an active duty post ought to be able to give you up-to-date information if there are any changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s something else to think about: if you barely pass the SIFT, that’s passing, it’s true&mdash;but it’s a score that will be compared with other test-takers, and frequently those with higher scores have more options and more opportunities, such as which kind of aircraft, first choice for schooling or assignments, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">The formulas and algorithms used to compute SIFT scores are not published by the Army, so unlike some other military tests, there’s no breakdown of how each subtest contributes to your score. However, Army officials have stated that the formula used to calculate the SIFT score is compensatory, meaning that poor performance on one subtest may often be offset by high performance on another. What this really means is that you need to do as well as you can on all the subtests.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">SIFT TESTING LOCATIONS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Since the SIFT is administered on a secure server platform, you can only take it at certain locations:</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span>Active duty Army post education centers</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span>Military academies</p>
<p class="bll"><span class="tcn">■</span>Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs at colleges and universities</p>
<p class="indent">You will need to schedule your SIFT exam at the location where you intend to test&mdash;you can’t just walk in. Current military service members should contact their closest Army post education center. Warrant Officer Flight Training (WOFT) applicants should contact a recruiter for help with scheduling the SIFT.</p>
<div class="gbox">
<p class="gth"><span class="gotham-medium">ON THE DAY OF THE TEST</span></p>
<p class="box_noindent"><span class="gotham-medium1">Bring some form of photo identification (driver’s license, military ID card, passport, etc.) and verification of your Social Security number (preferably your Social Security card). You won’t be able to bring in any electronic devices (phone, smartphone, camera, calculator, etc.) into the testing room, so you’ll probably want to leave them in your car; if not, the test proctor should be able to store them outside the testing room for you. Likewise, personal belongings such as book bags and purses are not allowed in the testing room. Even pencils and scratch paper for calculations will be furnished at the testing facility.</span></p>
<p class="box_indent"><span class="gotham-medium1">And yes, that’s right, no calculators&mdash;the SIFT math problems are designed to be completed without using a calculator. Whatever formulas you might need will be provided. Again, you will be given scratch paper to do calculations by hand as needed.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2892" class="calibre5"></a><a id="calibre_link-2408" href="#calibre_link-2503" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">Navy/Marine Corps/Coast Guard Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB-E)</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB-E) is used by the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard as one factor in the selection of pilot and flight officer candidates; it is designed to predict a test-taker’s potential performance during the beginning phases of aviation training. Aviation officer candidates and Navy intelligence officer applicants take the entire test, but all other Navy Officer Candidate School (OCS) candidates and Coast Guard officer candidates take just the first three sections of the exam (math skills, reading comprehension, and mechanical comprehension).</p>
<p class="indent">The current version of the ASTB, the ASTB-E, hit the streets in December 2013. It consists of seven subtests.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00804.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre18" /></p>
<p class="indent">Unless you are deployed aboard a ship, the ASTB-E is administered on a secure web-based testing platform known as Automated Pilot Examination (APEX); APEX platforms are also equipped with headphones and a video-game-like joystick. If you are deployed aboard your ship at sea, there are paper testing options, but you will need to contact your ship’s testing or education officer to get details on what is available in your situation.</p>
<p class="indent">The first four ASTB-E subtests are all adaptive, in the same way as explained earlier in the SIFT section. The PBM is an interactive multimedia test that assesses motor skills, spatial ability, reaction time, and multitasking abilities. The BI-RV may be taken on any web-enabled computer by an examinee using a user name and password provided by the examiner. This may be (but is not required to be) an APEX-equipped workstation.</p>
<p class="indent">In an adaptive test, your first question will be in the middle range of difficulty. If you answer it correctly, the next question will be harder. Answer that one correctly, and the questions will keep getting harder (or at least stay at the max level of difficulty) until you miss one, at which time you will get a less challenging question. If you don’t answer the first question correctly, however, the next one will be less difficult. The test continues in this way until your proficiency level is determined.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2893" class="calibre3"></a>The advantages of adaptive tests are that they take less time and you don’t have to wait to go on to the next subtest&mdash;but you can’t go back to a previous question, and you can’t skip around.</p>
<p class="indent">The four adaptive subtests of the ASTB-E (MST, RCT, MCT, and ANIT) will consist of a minimum of 20 multiple-choice questions and a maximum of 30, all from a test-specific item bank. Which questions you will see will depend a little bit on chance and mostly on your responses.</p>
<p class="indent">The Navy calculates six score components from weighted combinations of the ASTB-E subtests: the Academic Qualifications Rating (AQR), Pilot Flight Aptitude Rating (PFAR), Flight Officer Flight Aptitude Rating (FOFAR), Pilot Aviation Fit (PAF) Score, Flight Officer Aviation Fit (FOAF) Score, and Officer Aptitude Rating (OAR). The OAR score, derived from the MST, RCT, and MCT subtests only, is used for selecting nonaviation officer candidates.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s important to point out that you can definitely study and raise your scores for the first four subtests (MST, RCT, MCT, and ANIT). We’ll go over what the PBM consists of and how it’s set up to help you prepare for it. The NATFI and BI-RV are questions about you, your attitudes, and your experience; you already know these answers, and they will be customized to you.</p>
<p class="indent">You can take some of the subtests at different times, but an ASTB-E score will not be generated until all subtests (including the BI-RV) are completed and merged together&mdash;and all the tests must be taken within a 90-day window. If any of the tests fall outside the 90-day window, the test-taker won’t get any score but his or her OAR, and it will count against his or her lifetime three-test limit. AQR, PFAR, and FOFAR scores will not be generated until all ASTB-E subtests have been completed.</p>
<p class="indent">No one is permitted to take the ASTB-E more than three times in his or her lifetime&mdash; unless he or she previously took a nonadaptive version using a previous ASTB-E paper form, which won’t count against the three-test limit. The online APEX ASTB-E is delivered in adaptive format, presenting a different combination of questions to test-takers each time. After three attempts, the individual is ineligible for further ASTB-E testing. Applicants must wait at least 90 calendar days between ASTB-E attempts.</p>
<p class="indent">If for some reason an individual manages to repeat the same form of a nonadaptive test, no score will be generated and the attempt will be declared an “illegal” test; it will also count against the three-time lifetime limit. Applicants who have taken the entire ASTB-E and are being retested must take the entire ASTB-E again, even though they may be happy with their previous performance on parts of it.</p>
<p class="indent">An applicant’s official ASTB-E score will come from his or her most recent legal test. A retest found to be illegal due to insufficient time between tests or improper form usage will not replace legal recorded scores, but it will count against the three-time lifetime limit.</p>
<div class="gbox">
<p class="gth"><span class="gotham-medium"><a id="calibre_link-2894" class="calibre3"></a>ON THE DAY OF THE TEST</span></p>
<p class="box_noindent"><span class="gotham-medium1">Bring some form of photo identification (driver’s license, military ID card, passport, etc.) and verification of your Social Security number (preferably your Social Security card). You won’t be able to bring in any electronic devices (phone, smartphone, camera, calculator, watch with calculator, etc.) into the testing room, so you’ll probably want to leave them in your car; if not, the test proctor should be able to store them outside the testing room for you. Likewise, personal belongings such as book bags and purses are not allowed in the testing room.</span></p>
<p class="box_indent"><span class="gotham-medium1">And yes, that’s right, no calculators&mdash;the ASTB-E math problems are designed to be completed without using a calculator. Whatever formulas you might need will be provided, and you will be given pencils and scratch paper to do calculations by hand as needed.</span></p>
<p class="box_indent"><span class="gotham-medium1">The total time required to take the ASTB-E will vary from one person and one location to another. Completing all the subtests except the BI-RV will take from two to possibly as much as three and a half hours. If you are only taking the OAR subtests (the first three), the APEX version will take from 90 minutes to 2 hours and the paper version will take potentially a little longer.</span></p>
<p class="box_indent"><span class="gotham-medium1">The BI-RV portion of the ASTB-E can take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours to complete, and does not have to be completed in one administration session. The Navy recommends taking the BI-RV first (before coming to the testing location), since it can be completed on any web-based computer.</span></p>
<p class="box_indent"><span class="gotham-medium1">Possibly because most ASTB-E test-takers are non-DoD personnel&mdash;as opposed to those who are already service members&mdash;only those who have achieved qualifying ASTB-E scores will progress to flight surgeons or aviation medical examiners for flight physical examinations.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Math Skills Test (MST)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The MST measures your basic arithmetic, algebra, and geometry skills and knowledge, and there is the potential for you to see problems dealing with statistics, probability, and exponents (including negative and fractional). Some will be word problems, and some will be equations. There will also be questions that require solving for variables, time/rate/distance calculations, fractions, square roots, and the calculation of geometric shapes’ areas, angles, and perimeters.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, on an adaptive test, the questions keep getting harder when you get them right, and you will keep going until the test module has determined your skill level. You can’t skip and you can’t go back, but on the computerized version you should work through the problems without too much regard for how long you are taking&mdash;what counts is the questions you get right and their level of difficulty.</p>
<p class="indent">You won’t be allowed to use a calculator for either the paper or computerized version of the MST, but you won’t be working with hugely complicated numbers, either. Test-takers have reported that you will be provided a list of general math equations, but it will still be up to you to know which ones to use and how to use them&mdash;you will need to be quick and confident with basic arithmetic and order of operations, and really understand the problems that you practice.</p>
<p class="h3"><a id="calibre_link-2895" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">Reading Comprehension Test (RCT)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Reading comprehension items require ASTB-E examinees to understand the meaning of selected passages of text. Each item requires the test-taker to decide which of the possible answers can be inferred from the text in the passage. The questions will present you with a short passage to read, and you will then have to select the answer choice that can be deduced or inferred from the information given in the passage. This can be a little tricky because more than one of the answer choices may in fact be true or correct in some way&mdash;but if the information that backs that up is not in the passage, it won’t be the right answer, no matter how true it is.</p>
<p class="indent">The difficulty and length of the passages will increase as you answer correctly, and many of the harder passages will deal with military-specific subjects. Therefore, it’s important for you to become familiar with as much contextual or background information as possible&mdash;the Aviation and Nautical Information sections in <a href="#calibre_link-2486" class="calibre3">Chapter 7</a> will help you with that.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Mechanical Comprehension Test (MCT)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Questions in the Mechanical Comprehension section of the ASTB-E include topics that would typically be found in a high school general physics course. The questions measure test-takers’ knowledge of scientific principles dealing with gases and liquids, as well as their understanding of how these properties affect pressure, volume, and velocity. The subtest can also include questions about the components and performance of engines; potential and kinetic energy; principles of electricity, gears, and weight distribution; and the operation of simple machines, such as levers, fulcrums, and pulleys.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Aviation and Nautical Information Test (ANIT)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The ANIT measures an examinee’s knowledge of aviation history, nautical terminology and procedures, and aviation-related concepts such as aircraft components, aerodynamic principles, and flight rules and regulations. Of all the ASTB-E subtests, ANIT scores are the most easily improved by studying because this subtest is primarily a test of knowledge instead of aptitude. Examinees can prepare for this subtest by reviewing <a href="#calibre_link-2486" class="calibre3">Chapter 7</a> in this book, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and civilian aviation books, and handbooks and manuals about basic piloting, navigation, and seamanship.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Naval Aviation Trait Facet Inventory (NATFI)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The NATFI is a <span class="italic">forced choice</span> computer-adaptive personality inventory consisting of 88 questions. “Forced choice” means that you have to pick one of the pairs of alternatives offered as being more applicable to you&mdash;what you like, what you would do, how you are. The actual questions are not released by the Navy.</p>
<p class="indent">Although you can’t study for the NATFI&mdash;and experience shows that you can’t “game” it and give the answers you think the Navy wants&mdash;you should be prepared for some (or even most) of the choices presented to be between two alternatives that don’t seem to apply, don’t seem positive, or don’t appear to relate to each other.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2896" class="calibre3"></a>Reportedly, an example of this kind of “no good choice” question might go something like this:</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="gotham-medium">A. I get nervous when I am under pressure.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="gotham-medium">B. I try not to drive at night because I am not confident in my driving ability.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">The best strategy here is not to agonize over the choices&mdash;just pick the one that seems closest to being correct (or even just least incorrect) and drive on.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Performance-Based Measures (PBM)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The PBM is a set of interactive, multimedia, performance-based tests that are similar to some video games. It tests your motor skills, spatial abilities (how well you think in three dimensions), reaction time, ability to concentrate despite distractions, multitasking abilities, physical dexterity, and hand-eye coordination.</p>
<p class="indent">The point is not to see if you know how to fly an airplane, but to see how well you can perform certain relatively simple tasks while other things are going on that are intended to distract you. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to study in the conventional sense for this subtest&mdash;but what follows is a preview of what you will experience.</p>
<p class="indent">Tests within the PBM include Dichotic Listening, Digit Cancellation, Multi-Tracking, Vertical Tracking, Airplane Tracking, and Emergency Scenarios.</p>
<p class="indent">When taking the PBM, you will use a joystick and throttle combination (sometimes known as a “hands-on throttle and stick” setup) similar to <a href="#calibre_link-2504" class="calibre3">Figure 3.1</a>, as well as some garden variety headphones. All these will be provided to you by the test site.</p>
<p class="indent">Each section is preceded by a practice session. Make the most out of the practice and take some time to understand what you are supposed to do, as well as to get comfortable with the joystick and throttle setup.</p>
<p class="indent">Another thing to keep in mind is that the PBM test session is layered, meaning that you get a single task, then another, and then you have to do both simultaneously. Then the test adds on another task, and so on. This makes the practice before each session even more important.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-2504"><img src="images/00845.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre1" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 3.1</span> Examples of PBM Equipment</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In the first section, you see a “north up” map and a symbol that shows which way you are facing. Then, from a point of view as if you were in the air looking down at the ground, you see a picture of a building with four parking lots&mdash;one on each side&mdash;and you are asked which cardinal direction a certain lot is from the building. This is repeated several times, with the direction you are facing and the parking lot concerned changing each time. This section requires both speed and accuracy; you may want to make some flash cards to practice.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2897" class="calibre3"></a>In the next section, you will hear instructions in your headphones that tell you which ear to listen to; then you will be told to press a button on the joystick if you hear an odd number in that ear, and to click a button on the throttle if you hear an even number in that ear. Then, you will hear numbers and letters in both ears, and your task is to focus on the ear you were told to listen to and respond to even and odd numbers you hear by pressing the appropriate button.</p>
<p class="indent">In the following section, the screen has a narrow track on the left with an aircraft symbol in it. The symbol moves up and down, and your task is to use the throttle to keep your “pipper” (gunsight) superimposed on the symbol.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, the aircraft symbol moves over the entire screen, and your task is to use your joystick to keep your pipper on the aircraft symbol. This task then combines with the previous one, and you use both joystick and throttle to try to line up on the aircraft symbol as it moves randomly over the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on reports from those who have recently taken the ASTB-E, the operative word here seems to be <span class="italic">try</span>&mdash;so do your best and don’t get frustrated. Also, reportedly, you will only have to use one button on your joystick, but you may have to use more than one button on the throttle. Pay attention to the directions you get at the time and you will come out okay.</p>
<p class="indent">The next iteration adds in the numbers and letters in your headphones while you are chasing the aircraft symbol across the screen with your stick and throttle.</p>
<p class="indent">Eventually you will be given certain buttons to push (or other actions to take) as “emergency procedures.” Then, during an on-screen flight, you are given “warnings” that require you to take the emergency procedure you were briefed on; both your accuracy and reaction time are graded on this part of the PBM.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, you won’t be able to directly practice these events because the Navy wants to see how your “first-time” reaction stacks up against its standards. Even so, you will be better off now because you know a little about what is coming. However, you may find it useful to solve mental rotation problems like those in <a href="#calibre_link-2505" class="calibre3">Chapter 9</a> and on the AFOQT.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Biographical Inventory with Response Verification (BI-RV)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The Biographical Inventory with Response Verification (BI-RV) is an unproctored (unsupervised) subtest taken outside of the APEX environment as a separate testing session from the ASTB-E. It can take anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours to complete in total, and it does not have to be completed in a single session. The Navy actually recommends that you get it done before you take the rest of the ASTB-E if you can; your recruiter can help you with this.</p>
<p class="indent">The BI-RV only assesses background experiences&mdash;things you have done&mdash;such as academic achievements and extracurricular activities in high school and college. However, it is a powerful predictor of whether you will finish pilot training or not because the questions it asks all have something to do with how you might deal with a demanding, fast-paced aviation instructional program.</p>
<p class="indent">When you take the BI-RV, you will be asked to provide verification information for some responses. For example, if you indicate that you played on a sports team in college, you will be required to manually type in the type of sport, position played, the name of the college or university, and the year(s) you played. Falsifying information on this test is grounds for disqualification for service as an aviator, even if you have already started training&mdash;and even if you have completed it.</p>
<p class="indent">What a shame it would be to finish pilot training but not be allowed to fly! Honesty really is the best policy here, as it is elsewhere in life.</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-2898" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">ASTB-E TEST SCORES</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Examinees who take the entire test receive four scores resulting from different combinations of the seven subtests. Examinees who only take the first three subtests receive only one score, the Officer Aptitude Rating (OAR). The four scores given to examinees taking the entire test are:</p>
<p class="blockquote">The <span class="bold">Academic Qualifications Rating (AQR)</span> is used to predict academic performance in aviation preflight instruction and the primary phase of ground school. This score is affected by the examinee’s performance on all the subtests, but the strongest influence is made by his or her score on the Math Skills Test. Scoring ranges from 1 to 9; the minimum score to become a Navy pilot or flight officer is a 3.</p>
<p class="blockquote">The <span class="bold">Pilot Flight Aptitude Rating (PFAR)</span> ranges from 1 to 9 and is used to predict primary flight performance for student naval aviators. This score is affected by performance on all subtests, but the greatest contribution is made by scores on the Aviation and Nautical Information and Performance-Based Measures subtests. The current minimum score to qualify as a Navy pilot is a 4.</p>
<p class="blockquote">The <span class="bold">Flight Officer Flight Aptitude Rating (FOFAR)</span>, again ranging from 1 through 9, is used to predict primary phase flight school performance for student naval flight officers. This score is affected by performance on all subtests, but the strongest influence is from the Math Skills Test. The current minimum score to qualify as a Navy flight officer is a 4.</p>
<p class="blockquote">The <span class="bold">Officer Aptitude Rating (OAR)</span> is used by the Navy to predict academic performance in Navy Officer Candidate School. This score comes from performance on the first three subtests. This score ranges from a minimum of 20 through a maximum of 80, with a current average score of about 50.</p>
<p class="indent">Test-takers will get immediate ASTB-E scores as soon as all seven subtests are complete. If they are taking the OAR through APEX, scores will be generated upon completion. Those taking the paper version of the OAR have to wait until their tests are scored by the Navy. Recruiters and other test administrators are not able to provide unofficial scores for paper tests.</p>
<p class="indent">If you take the paper version of the OAR (the first three subtests), you are not allowed to take the other ASTB-E subtests until the Navy has processed the answer sheet. A paper OAR test will only generate an OAR score. If you complete the paper OAR and later need a full set of ASTB-E scores, you will have to complete the remaining subtests at an APEX-enabled testing site within 90 days of completing the paper test.</p>

<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2410" href="#calibre_link-2508" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">EFFECTIVE STUDYING</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Many people hold two incorrect beliefs about test taking. First, they believe that the amount of time spent studying is the most important&mdash;or maybe even the only&mdash;factor in improving their test results. Likewise, many people believe that last-minute studying (commonly referred to as “cramming”) will get the job done. Neither of these ideas is correct.</p>
<p class="indent">The proven truth is that <span class="italic">efficient</span> studying <span class="italic">ahead of time</span> is by far the best method, and the <span class="italic">only</span> really effective way to get significantly better results on whatever test you’re preparing for. Although it <span class="italic">is</span> true that any time spent studying is better than none, the question you have to ask yourself is this: <span class="italic">Am I getting the most benefit possible out of the time I am spending studying?</span></p>
<p class="indent">Because time is a finite resource&mdash;you’re never going to have 25 hours in a day, nor 61 minutes in an hour&mdash;it makes sense to use it as wisely and as efficiently as possible. Remember that you have the same number of minutes in an hour and hours in a day that Aristotle, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, and the Wright brothers did&mdash;and you have vastly more resources at your fingertips than they ever did!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the time you <span class="italic">do</span> have count for as much as possible, <span class="italic">plan</span> your studying, and do it as far ahead of time as possible. This will make the time you spend studying more effective, instead of just time spent reading (there’s a difference). Although the amount of time you spend studying is important, the amount of time you spend studying <span class="italic">effectively</span> is even more important&mdash;and it’s what will help you get improved results on your test. So, you need to develop a system.</p>
<p class="indent">Spending an hour a day in uninterrupted studying in a quiet, nondistracting place will pay off far more than spending twice that time in 15&ndash;20 minute segments, especially if you are in a place where there are distractions or interruptions. Contrary to what many people today think, studying with the TV on is <span class="italic">not</span> the most effective way to study; <span class="italic">any</span> distraction is, well . . . distracting. If it takes away from your focus on what you’re studying, it’s bad. If you can start studying a week, two weeks, or more before your test&mdash;or, if not, as far ahead as possible&mdash;it will give your brain and memory time to shift the material from your short-term memory (think of a temporary file on your computer desktop) to your long-term memory (think of a file permanently saved on your hard drive), where you will be able to access it more easily.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2900" class="calibre5"></a><a id="calibre_link-2411" href="#calibre_link-2509" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">STUDYING TIPS</span></a></p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Establish a study schedule and stick to it.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Don’t put off studying until it’s convenient, or for some time when you have nothing else to do. If the test is important enough for you to take, it’s important enough to invest the time in it to do as well as you can. Make studying a priority, equal in importance at least to your social life or watching television. How many movies or concerts or music stars or actors have any chance at all to improve your future? Those celebrities are not going to take your test for you (and even if they did, you probably wouldn’t like the results). Schedule your study time and make every effort not to let anything else interfere with that schedule.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Concentrate your study efforts in your weakest areas.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Chances are you already have an idea of the general areas where you are weak, strong, or just so-so. The first practice test for your service will give you some more focused insight about the kinds of questions you do well on, as well as the ones where you need some work&mdash;but don’t neglect your stronger areas and let them become your new “need work” categories! Go back and review information in the specific areas where you realize that you need help; if some area is still not clear to you, do further research in a library or on the Internet. If you’re in college, find a classmate who is strong in that area and ask for help, or go find a professor or graduate assistant in that subject and explain your goal; chances are they will make time to help you. Even if you’re not enrolled in a college or university right now, you can still pick up the phone and call an expert in the field (maybe at that local college you’re not enrolled in) and ask for suggestions on sources appropriate to your level and the time you have available.</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re ready to take the second test, look back at how many questions in each section you got right and wrong, and decide that you are going to get every question right on the second practice test. Then take the second practice test for your preferred service and do what’s necessary from there.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Study without interruption or stopping for at least 30 minutes at a time.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Set up your schedule so that you can study for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 minutes. If you have set aside a couple of hours, for instance, take a short break (maybe five, no more than 10 minutes) after 30&ndash;45 minutes&mdash;get a drink, go to the restroom, stretch briefly&mdash;but don’t lose your focus! It’s easy to get distracted during this time, so stay away from the TV, don’t make any phone calls, don’t start organizing your closet&mdash;don’t do anything that’s going to keep you from diving right back into your studying. BUT, when you are taking a practice test, do the complete examination in one sitting, just as you will have to do when it comes time to actually take the test.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Make sure you understand the correct meaning of every word you read or hear.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Your ability to grasp and comprehend what you read is the key to doing well on the test&mdash;after all, it <span class="italic">is</span> a <span class="italic">written</span> test, right? If it was a test on making baskets from the free-throw line, would you practice more on dribbling and passing or on what you were going to be tested on? Remember (and you already know this), the flight aptitude test you’re preparing for is not just a test to earn a numerical grade on a report card; it’s a test to see if you have what it takes to take advantage of a whole wealth of opportunities . . . or not. So, starting now, every time you see a word whose meaning you aren’t completely sure of (whether you’re studying at that <a id="calibre_link-2901" class="calibre3"></a>moment or not), make the effort to look it up. If you can’t look it up right then, write it down and look it up when you can. This will require self discipline, but you will get the benefit not only on the test, but also in your daily life.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Keep a list of the words you didn’t know and had to look up.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Then go back and review them periodically. Try to use them in conversation when it’s appropriate&mdash;not to make yourself sound like an egghead, but to be able to express yourself more precisely and concisely. Stretch your mental muscles by doing crossword puzzles.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Write it down.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">It is a well-proven fact that you retain things that you write down better and longer than those things that you just hear, even if you say them&mdash;so take the time and effort to write down the word and its definition, not on a computer, but <span class="italic">longhand</span>. Okay, print it in block letters if you want, but <span class="italic">write it down</span>. Then write a sentence using that word as it might be used in a real conversation or in an imaginary term paper. The mental and physiological effort you expend to write that word or concept down significantly reinforces your memory of it far above just hearing or even saying it. Even if you never see those notes again&mdash;and you <span class="italic">should</span> review them&mdash;you will still retain the material better.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Simulate test conditions when studying&mdash;and <span class="italic">especially</span> when taking practice tests!</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To the extent that you can, reproduce the same conditions you will encounter when you are taking the actual test. The more you do this when you are “just” studying&mdash;not to mention when you are taking a practice test&mdash;the more you will be used to this kind of environment when it comes time for the test that counts. If you have other people in the household, tell them that you are taking a practice test and ask for their support by not disturbing you; chances are they will be happy to comply.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Time yourself when taking practice tests.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Running out of time on a multiple-choice test is a tragedy that you can avoid. Learn through practice how much time is reasonable to spend on any particular question, and then stick to it.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Exercise regularly and stay in good physical shape.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">It’s hard to remember sometimes that life is supposed to be about balance, especially when you have too many things to do and nowhere near enough time to do even half of them. However, the bottom line here is that if your body isn’t in at least decent shape, you will not do as well as you could on the test. Do at least 20&ndash;30 <span class="italic">uninterrupted</span> minutes of aerobic exercise (something that makes you breathe hard) at least two to three times a week, and preferably more. Strength training (lifting some kind of weights) is good, but balance the amount of weight you can lift with how many repetitions you can do, and don’t overdo things to the extent that you risk injury. Even a temporary injury is a distraction you don’t need.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Practice, practice, practice&mdash;stay in good mental shape, too.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">After you take both practice tests for your preferred service, look at the sections in the other services’ tests that are similar to the areas where you still need work. Even if you think <a id="calibre_link-2902" class="calibre3"></a>vocabulary is a strong point for you, for instance, don’t rest on your laurels; get everything out of this book that you can by looking at the language-related sections in the other tests. Look on the Internet for practice questions for your service’s test. Look at practice SAT, ACT, and GRE tests that are available to you, even if they are older versions available in the library&mdash;the meaning of <span class="italic">indubitably</span> won’t change, nor will the formula for the area of a circle.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2412" href="#calibre_link-2510" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">GUIDELINES FOR MULTIPLE-CHOICE TESTS</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">This section lays out specific test-taking techniques that will help you on multiple-choice tests. Learn and then practice these techniques so that they are second nature to you by the time you take the test.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Read the directions.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Don’t assume that you know what the directions are for a specific section, or for the test overall, without reading them. Make sure you read them thoroughly as if it was the first time you had seen them, and make sure you understand them fully. This is not <span class="italic">spending</span> time so much as <span class="italic">investing</span> it&mdash;and why take a chance on canceling out all the effort you’ve spent studying and otherwise preparing? Besides, the test monitor or proctor won’t let you start until everyone has had plenty of time to read the directions&mdash;they may read them aloud, too&mdash;so there’s no reason <span class="italic">not</span> to read the directions. Pay special attention to whether there are different directions from one section of the test to another.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Be careful when you mark your answers on paper tests.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that you mark your answers in accordance with the instructions on the answer sheet. Pay special attention to make sure that you do the following:</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Make</span> <span class="ubolditalic">sure</span> <span class="bold">you are marking the numbered answer for the question you think you are answering.</span> Although this may seem pretty obvious (and it is), lots of test-takers have failed because of this kind of carelessness. All it takes is getting off track on one question. You probably won’t notice it right away, so you’ll continue being off for even more questions. Fortunately, this is not an issue with computerized tests.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Don’t make any extra or stray marks on your answer sheet;</span> most tests are machine graded, and it’s not going to help you to confuse the scanner or optical character reader.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Completely fill in the allotted space</span> (circle, oval, rectangle) for the answer you choose.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Erase</span> <span class="ubolditalic">completely</span> any answers you want to change. This goes back to your preparation, in that you need to bring a good, fresh eraser that works.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">For Paper and Computerized Tests</span></p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Skip questions that are giving you too much trouble.</span> Don’t dwell on any one question too long on your first trip through that section or subtest. If you’ve read the question twice, tried to eliminate any obviously incorrect answers, and still have no clue between three or four choices, it’s time to go to the next question and come back when you get to the end of that section. There are two options on how to handle the question you’re skipping. First, you can just plain skip it if you’re reasonably certain you’re going to get to the end of the subsection with time to spare; the trick here is to make sure that you leave that answer totally blank on your answer sheet and don’t fill in the blank for the question that you skipped with the answer to the question <span class="italic">after</span> the one you skipped. <a id="calibre_link-2903" class="calibre3"></a>The second option is to go ahead and fill in an answer for one of the choices you think might be right so that you stay in sequence, and also to hedge your bets in case you don’t get to the end of the test with time enough to go back to questions that you skipped. Either way, if you are allowed to mark in your test booklet, or if you have scratch paper, circle the number of the question you skipped or write it down on the scratch paper.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Go back to the questions you skipped within a subtest after you get to the end.</span> Once you have answered all the questions you were at least reasonably sure of in a section or subtest, check to see how much time you have remaining. If you can, go back to the questions you skipped and reread the question and the choices. Sometimes a subsequent question will have jarred loose something in your memory and you will be able to make a good choice. If you read the question again and you still are having trouble, make the best guess you can, following the guidelines outlined here.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Make sure you understand what the question is really asking.</span> Read carefully the <span class="italic">root</span> or <span class="italic">stem</span> of the question&mdash;the part before the answer choices&mdash;to make sure you know what the question really is. Don’t be in such a galloping hurry that you slam through it and miss a <span class="italic">not</span> or <span class="italic">except</span> or some other small but important indicator. If none of the choices seem correct after the first time you look at them, read the question again.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Read all the choices before you choose an answer.</span> Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that the best distractor&mdash;a plausible but still incorrect answer&mdash;is it because it’s first and oh, boy, it seems right, and let’s get on to the next question!</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Know the key “tipoff” words that often signal a wrong answer.</span> Absolute words such as <span class="italic">never, nobody, nothing, always, all, only, any, everyone, everybody</span>, and the like are often clues that this answer is too broad and therefore wrong.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Know the key words that often signal a</span> <span class="ubolditalic">possibly</span> <span class="bold">correct answer.</span> Limiting words such as <span class="italic">usually, generally, sometimes, possible, many, some, occasionally, often</span>, and the like often signal a choice that at least <span class="italic">could</span> be correct&mdash;but read it carefully to be sure!</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Look at how the meaning of the choices compare with each other.</span> If two choices have a conflicting or opposite meaning, chances are high that one of them is correct. If two choices are very close in meaning, chances are pretty good that <span class="italic">neither</span> of them is correct.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">NEVER make a choice based on the frequency of lettered answer choices.</span> This is the same thing as rolling dice&mdash;the odds are stacked against you. If this is what you think will work, please just mail your money to the casino and don’t waste time and taxpayer money taking the test.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Eliminate choices you recognize as being incorrect.</span> <span class="underline">This is the most important guideline to success on any multiple-choice test</span>. As you read through the choices, eliminate any choice you know is wrong. If you can eliminate all the choices except one, there’s your answer! Read the choice one more time to make sure you haven’t missed anything, and then mark that answer on your answer sheet and move on to the next question. If you can eliminate only one or two of the possible choices, read through the question and the remaining choices once more. Many times the right answer will become apparent; if not&mdash;even if you have to flat-out guess between two or three possible choices that you think <span class="italic">could</span> be right&mdash;you will have significantly increased your odds of answering that question correctly.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Don’t</span> <span class="bold">reconsider answer choices that you have already eliminated.</span> If you thought it was wrong the first time through, you were probably correct. Focus on the ones that could be right.</p>
<p class="bl"><a id="calibre_link-2904" class="calibre3"></a><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="bold">Be very reluctant to change answers.</span> Unless you have an <span class="italic">excellent</span> reason, <span class="italic">don’t</span> change an answer you have already marked in the belief that it was correct. Studies have shown again and again and again that if you are still unsure and are just trying to use the really dependable intuition that has helped you so much up to this point (yes, that’s sarcasm), you are far more likely to change a right answer to a wrong one than the other way around.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2413" href="#calibre_link-2511" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">ON THE DAY OF THE TEST</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">First, <span class="bold">get a good night’s sleep</span> the night before the test. If you’ve established a plan and followed it, you won’t be up until the wee hours cramming; if you haven’t&mdash;well, good luck. Even better, try to get an adequate amount of sleep for several days before the test, and don’t neglect an appropriate amount of physical exercise (and then keep that good habit <span class="italic">after</span> you take the test); this will help you sleep better at night, and you’ll be more relaxed and have better stamina and resistance to stress during the day.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">Organize your morning</span> before you take the test for success. Lay out your clothes and test-taking materials the night before. Wake up early enough so that you can avoid rushing through your morning routine. Eat a good breakfast, but go easy on the carbs&mdash;some are okay, but just say “no” to that second stack of pancakes or second helping of hash browns. Your body won’t realize that you need that blood to your brain, and it will be trying to divert more blood to your digestive system than you can afford during the test. Drink plenty of water early on, but not so much that you are guaranteed to need a restroom break after the first 15 minutes of the test.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have a choice, <span class="bold">wear comfortable clothes</span> to the test. If you are wearing a uniform, make sure you are wearing a fresh one, have a fresh haircut and shave, and generally look as if you are ready to be inspected by the local general or admiral. No one will give you points on the test for concluding from your rumpled, haggard appearance that you have been up studying nonstop for days&mdash;but <span class="italic">you</span> will feel more confident (and will therefore be mentally sharper) if you look squared away and you know it. This applies whether you are wearing a uniform or not.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">Take a light jacket or sweater</span> that you can put on or take off easily. It might be cold in the testing area, and why subject yourself to an avoidable distraction?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">Take a stopwatch or digital watch with a timer.</span> Some proctors may give you a heads-up when your time for a certain section has almost elapsed, but most won’t&mdash;the proctors for the ASTB-E are actually instructed <span class="italic">not</span> to give any warnings. If you only have a few remaining questions, you can probably eliminate at least one or two wrong answer choices and guess between the ones that look plausible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">Get to the test location early</span><span class="bold">.</span> If you think it will take you 15 minutes to get there, allow 30. If you’ve been there a hundred times before and it’s never taken longer than 30 minutes, allow an hour; this is the one day there will be road construction or a traffic jam in your way. If it’s somewhere local but you haven’t been there before, try to do a reconnaissance of the location, to include the room itself, in the week before you take the test. The one time that you get bad directions off the “always reliable” map-generating Internet site on your smartphone will be the time you need them, badly, to get to the test site on time. If you have to rush into the test site frustrated and out of breath, you are not setting yourself up for success&mdash;and in some circumstances, if you get there late, you’ll be out of luck. If nothing else, get there with enough time to go to the restroom before you start the test, and to find a seat with a chair that doesn’t make a distracting noise every time you move. Put yourself on Lombardi time: If you’re not there early, you’re late.</p>

<p class="block1"><span class="italic">“The limits of my language are the limits of my world.”</span></p>
<p class="blockr"><span class="italic">&mdash;</span><span class="italic">Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1889&ndash;1951, Austrian&ndash;British professor and philosopher in logic, mathematics, reasoning, and language</span></p>
<p class="noindent-top"><span class="drop">F</span>or officers to <span class="italic">lead</span>&mdash;which is, regardless of service or specialty, an officer’s primary function&mdash;they must be able to <span class="italic">communicate</span> with the people they are trying to lead. The best plan in the world is worthless if the people who are supposed to execute it can’t understand what they’re supposed to do. If you want to be an officer in any service, you must be able to communicate at least reasonably well both orally and in writing&mdash;and, because officers are normally held to a higher standard, that “reasonably well” rating may be something at which you have to work.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter reviews a wide array of language-related topics that help measure whether you can read and understand information presented to you. The flight aptitude tests evaluate this by a variety of multiple-choice questions dealing with synonyms and antonyms, analogies, and vocabulary&mdash;all of which add up to answering the question, <span class="italic">Can you comprehend what you read?</span></p>
<p class="indent">Much of this information will hopefully already be familiar to you, but going over it won’t hurt you any&mdash;and chances are you will learn or reinforce something that will help you.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2415" href="#calibre_link-2514" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">SYNONYMS AND ANTONYMS</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="italic">synonym</span> is a word that has the same or almost the same meaning as another word. An <span class="italic">antonym</span> is a word that has the opposite or nearly opposite meaning of another word. A desk-size dictionary (not just a paperback version) will give you insight on some synonyms and maybe some antonyms; a thesaurus will give you the full range of both.</p>
<p class="indent">In determining whether a word has a similar or opposite meaning to another word, it’s helpful to understand the root of a word, as well as any prefixes or suffixes it may have. Go over the common roots, suffixes, and prefixes later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2416" href="#calibre_link-2515" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">VERBAL ANALOGIES</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The Air Force is the only service that tests flight aptitude test-takers on verbal analogies, but they are useful analytical tools for anyone. Verbal analogies test your ability to determine the relationships between words. To do that, though, you not only need to know what the words mean, you’ll also have to apply logic to determine the relationships between the words in consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two format types for verbal analogies on the AFOQT. The first type of analogy question contains three capitalized words in the stem, followed by five one-word choices. <a id="calibre_link-2906" class="calibre3"></a>The first two of the three words will give you the base analogy (THIS is to THAT); your task then is to choose which of the five choices has the same relationship to the third word as is established in the base analogy.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="indentbt">CAT is to KITTEN as WOLF is to</p>
<p class="ualpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> dog</p>
<p class="ualpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> cub</p>
<p class="ualpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> lion</p>
<p class="ualpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> puppy</p>
<p class="ualpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> cougar</p>
<p class="indentt">The correct answer is <span class="bold">(B) cub</span>. A baby cat is a kitten, and a baby wolf is a cub. Therefore, the relationship between the second capitalized word is the infant or baby form of the first capitalized word. A wolf’s offspring are called cubs, and that represents the same relationship to the wolf as the kitten has to the cat.</p>
<p class="indent">The second type of verbal analogy on the AFOQT involves only two capitalized words&mdash;the first pair&mdash;in the stem of the question. Your task is then to choose which of the five pairs of words presented most closely resembles the same relationship as in the first pair.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s a re-do of the first question recast in this format:</p>
<p class="indentbt">CAT is to KITTEN as</p>
<p class="ualpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> puppy is to dog</p>
<p class="ualpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> wolf is to cub</p>
<p class="ualpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> lion is to lioness</p>
<p class="ualpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> puppy is to kitten</p>
<p class="ualpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> cougar is to panther</p>
<p class="indentt">In this example, the only choice that represents the same relationship that CAT has to KITTEN is <span class="bold">(B) wolf is to cub</span>. Be careful to note that, in the base analogy, the adult form of the animal is listed first, so don’t be thrown off by choice (A) puppy is to dog, which is wrong because the younger form of the animal is listed first.</p>
<p class="indent">The most important part of correctly answering these analogy questions is to determine what kind of relationship exists between the first and second word in the first, or base, analogy, and then find a choice that closely reproduces that relationship between the two words used as the second analogy. There’s no way to list every possible relationship that could exist, but here are examples of the most common types of analogies.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Part to whole (correct):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">ROOM is to HOUSE as CABIN is to SHIP.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">A room is an integral part of a house in the same way that a cabin is part of a ship.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Part to whole (incorrect):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">ROOM is to HOUSE as CABIN is to DECK.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">The cabin and the deck are both parts of the ship; neither is a “whole” that the other is part of.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Part to whole (correct):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">GIRDER is to BUILDING as KEEL is to SHIP.</span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="calibre_link-2907" class="calibre3"></a>The girder and the keel are both structural components of the building and ship, respectively.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Part to whole (incorrect):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">GIRDER is to BUILDING as CABIN is to SHIP.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">The girder is a structural component of the building; the cabin, although a component of the ship, is not so much the same kind of component&mdash;doesn’t have the same relationship&mdash;as the girder is to the building.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Cause to effect (correct):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">SPARK is to FIRE as HURRICANE is to FLOOD.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">The fire is the direct result of the spark, just as the flood is the direct result of the hurricane.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Cause to effect (incorrect):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">SPARK is to FIRE as HURRICANE is to DESTRUCTION.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">The fire is the direct result of the spark, but the destruction is a result of the hurricane’s wind or flooding, and not so much a direct result of the hurricane itself.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Source to product (correct):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">TREE is to ORANGE as FACTORY is to PRODUCT.</span></p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Source to product (incorrect):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">TREE is to BRANCH as FACTORY is to PRODUCT.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">The branch is a part of the tree, but is not a product of it in the same way that a tree produces an orange or a factory produces its product.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Example to category (correct):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">CAR is to AUTOMOBILE as HOUSE is to DWELLING.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">The first item is one of multiple items in the second item, which is the “next level up” category; trucks and vans are automobiles just like cars are, and caves and houseboats are dwellings in the same way that a house is.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Example to category (incorrect):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">CAR is to TRUCK as HOUSE is to DWELLING.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">The car and the truck are both members of the same category&mdash;you could call this a “peer to peer” analogy&mdash;but the HOUSE is to DWELLING analogy is still an example-to-category exercise.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Example to category (incorrect):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">CAR is to AUTOMOBILE as HOUSE is to STRUCTURE.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">This incorrect example is a little more subtle; STRUCTURE is a much broader, more inclusive category than DWELLING, including as it does structures that cannot be lived in as a house or a barn or a cave could, such as bridges, statues, gazebos, reviewing stands, and so on.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">General to specific (correct):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">SHAPE is to TRIANGLE as PASTRY is to CROISSANT.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">This could also be thought of as a “category to example” analogy, merely the mirror image of the previous example.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Object to function (correct):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">SHIELD is to PROTECT as CONTAINER is to HOLD.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">Be sure the function word (almost certainly a verb) is the primary and definitive function of the noun/object that makes up the other word of the pair. If the function word is a minor or uncommon function of the object rather than a defining, typical function of the object, watch out!	</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Object to function (incorrect):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">WHEEL is to ROLL as SHIELD is to CARRY.</span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="calibre_link-2908" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">User to tool (correct):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">MECHANIC is to WRENCH as CARPENTER is to SAW.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">Usually the tool mentioned in this kind of analogy is a defining or typical tool for the kind of user described, as it is in this example.</p>

<p class="tipp"><span class="bold">When one word of the pair is a verb, make sure that the verb tense (present, past, past participle, etc.) is the same for both word pairs. The same goes for the number of nouns&mdash;if one word pair mentions a singular object, chances are the correctly matching second pair will <span class="underline">not</span> have a plural noun for its object.</span></p>

<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Descriptive (incorrect):</span> <span class="gotham-medium">CANDY is to SWEET as TURKEY is to COLD.</span></p>
<p class="indentt">Because a turkey can be any temperature, COLD is not a defining or frequently associated description of TURKEY, so this is not a valid analogy match.</p>

<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2417" href="#calibre_link-2516" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">READING COMPREHENSION</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Understanding what you read involves being able to recognize the main idea, remember details, make conclusions or inferences, identify and understand factual relationships, and paraphrase or summarize. All three tests will directly test you on these specific skills.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2910" class="calibre3"></a>The <span class="italic">main idea</span> is the most important point or concept that the writer wants the reader to know or understand. Sometimes the writer states the main idea clearly and directly; sometimes the main idea is implied or has to be inferred from what the passage <span class="italic">does</span> say. When a main idea is generalized across the entire passage, essay, book, and so on, it is known as the <span class="italic">theme</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Whenever you are trying to determine a paragraph’s main idea, it’s a good idea to check the first (opening) and last (closing) sentences of the paragraph. Writers frequently use a <span class="italic">topic sentence</span> (often either at the beginning or end of a paragraph or essay, although they can be anywhere) that concisely addresses the main idea.</p>
<div class="gbox">
<p class="box_noindent"><span class="gotham-medium1">To help you find the main idea in reading a passage or paragraph, ask these questions:</span></p>
<p class="bnlt"><span class="gotham-medium1"><span class="nl">1.</span> Who or what is this paragraph about?</span></p>
<p class="bnl"><span class="gotham-medium1"><span class="nl">2.</span> What specific aspect or facet of this subject is the writer discussing?</span></p>
<p class="bnl"><span class="gotham-medium1"><span class="nl">3.</span> What point is the writer trying to make about this subject or this particular aspect of it?</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indentt">Look at this example paragraph:</p>
<p class="indent_blk">Making any of the eight errors common to transformation efforts can have serious consequences. In slowing down the new initiatives, creating unnecessary resistance, frustrating employees endlessly, and sometimes completely stifling needed change, any of these errors could cause an organization to fail to offer the products or services people want at prices they can afford. Budgets are then squeezed, people are laid off, and those who remain are put under great stress. The impact on families and communities can be devastating.</p>
<p class="indent">In this paragraph, the main idea is stated in the first sentence. You can tell that the paragraph will be about what happens when an organization makes any of the “eight errors common to transformation.” In the same way as a headline or title, the topic sentence introduces the rest of the paragraph, setting the stage and getting you thinking about what’s going to follow.</p>
<p class="indent_blk">During the latter years of the American Revolution, a government structured under the Articles of Confederation was formed. This government, which gave the states more power than the central national government, suffered severely and had many problems. The states distrusted each other and allowed the national or federal government to exercise very little authority. The Articles of Confederation produced a government that could not effectively raise money from taxes, prevent or stop Indian raids, or force the British out of the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you identify the topic sentence in the paragraph above? Yes, the paragraph <span class="italic">is</span> about the Articles of Confederation. However, is the main idea in the first sentence, the second, or somewhere else? In this example, the <span class="italic">second</span> sentence does the best job of giving you an overall understanding of this paragraph: The lack of centralized authority under the Articles of Confederation caused lots of problems. The first sentence really just tells us <span class="italic">when</span> the items in the paragraph happened&mdash;it doesn’t explain anything about what happened, much less the overarching idea. The sentences that follow give more details about this idea; they give <a id="calibre_link-2911" class="calibre3"></a>you some of the reasons why the topic sentence was true. It’s not a good idea to assume that the topic sentence is always the first sentence.</p>
<p class="indent_blk">With its smaller population and more agriculturally centered (and therefore manpower-intensive) economy, the Confederacy had fewer men available as soldiers. Less than one-third of the railroads and even fewer prewar United States industries were in the South. For most of the war, the ports and coastlines of Confederate states were blockaded by the Union Navy. It is considered in many circles a tribute to Confederate leadership and Southern courage that the rebels were not defeated sooner.</p>
<p class="noindent">In this case, you can see that the passage builds up to its main point, which is in the last sentence.</p>
<p class="indent">And, as mentioned before, you may also find that the main idea is not stated directly at all, but can only be inferred or deduced from the whole passage or paragraph.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Finding Details</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In developing the main idea of a paragraph or passage, the writer usually makes statements or shows action to support his or her point. They may give examples to illustrate the main idea, or they may mention facts or statistics to support it. The writer may give reasons why the main idea statement is true or correct; they might offer arguments for or against the position or idea that the main idea states. The writer can also define a complex term, cite different characteristics of a complex system or organization, classify objects within a larger category, or use descriptive details to develop an idea and help the reader understand or envision the situation. Also, the writer may <span class="italic">compare</span> two ideas, objects, or processes, to show how they are alike or similar, or the writer may <span class="italic">contrast</span> them&mdash;show how they are different.</p>
<p class="indent">Read how the writer of the following paragraph uses supporting details:</p>
<p class="indent_blk">My most hyperactive year was from June 1944 to June 1945. Arriving in England just in time for the invasion, my first mission as a new pilot in the 353rd Fighter Squadron was flying top cover over the invasion, combined with emptying my guns&mdash;strafing anything that moved in front of the Allied troops fighting for a secure beachhead. The reality of war became more complete on D+10 (June 16) when I landed our first P-51 at airstrip A2 at Criqueville, France. The reality of war meant being fired on during takeoff and landing. It seemed questionable to me to risk planes and pilots so close to the front; the rationale was more missions per plane per day, in addition to the advantage of avoiding the “London fog” weather of England, but France turned out to be just as bad. Our mission was to patrol the skies above and in front of the Third Army, keeping the Luftwaffe at bay, dive-bombing before each patrol and strafing afterward. We also flew escort for B-17, B-26, and B-25 bombers.</p>
<p class="noindent">To help you understand what was “hyperactive” about the year from June 1944 to June 1945, the writer gives supporting details, detailing not only the amount of work or effort that went into his activities, but also some clues about the pace of the operations and the pilots’ concerns about enemy fire.</p>
<p class="indent">When the test requires you to answer a question about some detail or details in the passage, you have to find words or phrases in the passage that specifically answer the question. <a id="calibre_link-2912" class="calibre3"></a>In other words, considering the previous passage, the test will <span class="italic">not</span> ask you about what kind of plane the writer flew before coming to Europe; the passage doesn’t address that. Instead, it might ask you what kind of plane the writer flew when landing in France (P-51, fighter), when the writer landed in France (June 16, 1944), or who the writer’s unit was up against (the Luftwaffe or German Air Force).</p>
<div class="gbox">
<p class="box_noindent"><span class="gotham-medium1">Try the following techniques when a test asks you a specific question about details of the passage:</span></p>
<p class="bnlt"><span class="gotham-medium1"><span class="nl">1.</span> Look for key words (nouns and verbs) in the question stem and answer choices.</span></p>
<p class="bnl"><span class="gotham-medium1"><span class="nl">2.</span> Read rapidly through the passage, looking for those key words or their synonyms.</span></p>
<p class="bnl"><span class="gotham-medium1"><span class="nl">3.</span> Reread the part of the passage that contains the key word(s) or synonyms.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Understanding the Passage’s Organization</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Questions about a reading passage will also test your ability to understand the organization of the ideas in the passage and their relationship to each other. Writers usually organize their information in fairly predictable, logical ways to make it easier for the reader to understand. Recognizing common organizational patterns improves your understanding, memory, and reading speed&mdash;as well as helping you choose the right answer on the test.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">SEQUENTIAL ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="italic">sequence</span> is a series of events or steps where the order is important. If the sequence is <span class="italic">chronological</span> (time based), the events are described or listed in the order in which they occurred. Clues to help you spot sequential organization include ordinal numbers (<span class="italic">first, second, third</span>, etc.), cardinal numbers (<span class="italic">1</span>, <span class="italic">2</span>, <span class="italic">3</span>, etc.), transition words or phrases (<span class="italic">then, next, later, finally, ultimately</span>), and dates or other information referring to time (<span class="italic">this year, last month, in 1982, four days later,</span> and so on).</p>
<p class="indent_blk">If you are stung by a bee, the first thing you need to do is remove the stinger. Next, make a paste of baking soda and water and apply it to the sting site. Then, apply ice or cold water to help reduce the pain and minimize swelling. If the pain is severe or if you are allergic to the insect, find medical help immediately.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">PHYSICAL OR SPATIAL ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When the organization of a passage is physical or spatial, it describes the physical arrangement or situation of a place or object. Clues can include such words as <span class="italic">above, below, to the right of, to the left of, behind, in front of, next to,</span> and so on.</p>
<p class="indent_blk">Taste buds are distributed across the tongue, but the distribution is uneven, and certain areas of the tongue are more sensitive to certain basic tastes than other areas. The tip of the tongue is most sensitive to sweetness, but the area just behind the tip is the most sensitive to salty tastes. Only the sides of the tongue are very sensitive to sour tastes, and the back area specializes in bitter tastes.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2913" class="calibre5"></a><span class="bold1">Cause and Effect</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A passage may include a description of a particular thing that happened, the reasons why it happened, and/or the results that came after the occurrence. For instance, a history passage may list the events that led up to a technological innovation, a social or political change, or a war; a scientific passage may explain tectonic plate shifts and how they affect mountain formation and earthquakes. Often, the relationship is presented as a chain of events, with one or more events leading to or resulting in one or more other events. Clues include words like <span class="italic">resulted in, because, consequently, since, therefore, thus,</span> and so on.</p>
<p class="indent_blk">By the year 2020, there will be approximately one retired American for every two working Americans. In these disproportionately large numbers, older Americans will therefore become an increasingly large and powerful political force, and political issues of concern to senior citizens and elderly people such as housing, medical benefits, and reduced employment levels will be taken more seriously by elected officials.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Comparing and Contrasting Ideas</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A passage may present the similarities or differences between ideas, people, places, or other things. In a <span class="italic">comparison</span>, the passage will focus on similarities; clue words can include <span class="italic">like, likewise, also, in like manner, similarly,</span> and the like. The passage may instead focus on differences, presenting a <span class="italic">contrast</span>; clues for contrasting include <span class="italic">but, unlike, however, in contrast, on the other hand, versus,</span> and <span class="italic">nevertheless</span>.</p>
<p class="indent_blk">The American farm problem often centers on supply exceeding demand and farm policies that encourage surplus production. This is not true in most other parts of the world, however, where countries cannot produce enough food to support their own populations and have to import food or else face famine.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Solution to a Problem</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The writer may present the reader with a problem or describe a situation that is causing difficulty, and then present or suggest a solution or a remedy. Clue words include <span class="italic">problem, cause, effects, consequences, answers, solutions,</span> and <span class="italic">remedy</span> or <span class="italic">remedies.</span></p>
<p class="indent_blk">Students who lived in dormitories near an area in which earthquakes happened frequently, one study says, often just dealt with their problems by denying the seriousness of the situation and the potential danger they were in.</p>
<p class="noindent">(In this case, the solution&mdash;although an unrealistic and ineffective one&mdash;was simply to ignore the problem.)</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Drawing a Conclusion or Making an Inference</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A conclusion is a logical inference based on information that is presented or implied. If you read a passage critically (which, in this case, doesn’t mean <span class="italic">negatively</span>, but rather just <span class="italic">carefully</span>), you follow the writer’s train of thought and arrive at logical conclusions. The writer may expect the readers to draw the conclusion by themselves, or the writer may explicitly state it, often using clue words such as <span class="italic">therefore, thus, hence,</span> or <span class="italic">in conclusion</span>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2914" class="calibre3"></a>The sample passage that follows is about Americans with disabilities. The reader can conclude that legislation has made progress in moving people with disabilities into society’s mainstream, although the writer doesn’t say so directly. Incidentally, note the sequence pattern in this passage.</p>
<p class="indent_blk">A major goal for the disabled is easier access to the mainstream of society. The 1973 Rehabilitation Act has moved them toward this goal, as has the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which mandates that all children, however severe their disability, receive a free, appropriate education. Before the legislation, one million handicapped children were receiving no education and another three million were getting an inappropriate one (as in the case of a blind child who is not taught Braille or is not provided with instructional materials in Braille). In 1987, Congress enacted the Employment Opportunities for Disabled Americans Act, which allows disabled individuals to earn a moderate income without losing their Medicaid health coverage.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2418" href="#calibre_link-2517" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">THE PARTS OF A WORD</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">When you first learned how to drive, you had to learn the parts of an automobile and what they did, from the hood to the wheels to the engine to the controls and instruments to the trunk. Now you can use that automobile to transport yourself from one place to another.</p>
<p class="indent">In much the same way, if you want to transport your message to your listener, words are your vehicle&mdash;and the more you understand about how words are built, the better work they will do for you. You can (and should) flip this around, too: <span class="bold">For you to understand the test you are preparing to take, you have to be able to understand the words</span> <span class="bold">the writers use</span><span class="bold">.</span> This is not just for the part of the test dealing with language skills. The whole test is written, which means that you have to be able to read and understand it. You may be the world’s best math whiz, but if you can’t read the directions to a problem, you will never get a chance to demonstrate that skill.</p>
<p class="indent">The most important part of any word is the <span class="italic">root</span>. It may be a word in itself (for example, <span class="italic">flex</span>), or a word element from which other words are formed (<span class="italic">aud</span>, for instance). Knowing a large number of word roots is one way of multiplying your vocabulary’s strength, because each root can lead you to the understanding of several words.</p>
<p class="indent">A <span class="italic">prefix</span> is a syllable or group of syllables added to the beginning of a word that changes its meaning. Let’s go back to the previous example, <span class="italic">flex</span>. By itself, it means “to bend or contract”; we’ll say that the context is the human body, so you can flex a muscle, an arm, or the like. If you add the prefix <span class="italic">re</span> to the root word <span class="italic">flex</span>, you get a new word, <span class="italic">reflex</span>, with a new meaning: <span class="italic">reflex</span> describes an action you can’t control, such as a sneeze.</p>
<p class="indent">We can further change the meaning of the root word <span class="italic">flex</span> by adding a suffix. A suffix is a syllable or group of syllables added to the end of a word that changes its meaning. If you add the suffix <span class="italic">ible</span> to the end of the root, you get another new word, <span class="italic">flexible</span>, with a new meaning: <span class="italic">flexible</span> means <span class="italic">able to bend without breaking</span> or, in a more general sense, <span class="italic">able to adjust to change</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also add <span class="italic">both</span> a prefix and a suffix to a root and get still another word. If, for example, you add both the prefix <span class="italic">in</span> (meaning <span class="italic">not</span>) and the suffix <span class="italic">ible</span>, you get another word, <span class="italic">inflexible</span>, which means <span class="italic">unbending</span>&mdash;or, in a broader sense, <span class="italic">stubborn, unable to adapt to change</span>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2915" class="calibre3"></a>To extend the example, let’s look at some more of the <span class="italic">flex</span> “family” of words. It’s helpful to know in this case that <span class="italic">flect</span> is another form of <span class="italic">fle</span><span class="italic">x</span>; however, even though similar-sounding words often have the same root, don’t be fooled that it is always the case&mdash;because it’s not.</p>

<p class="noindent">Mark Twain is supposed to have said, “The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.” Military officers, who are responsible for the lives of the people they lead&mdash;not to mention accomplishing the missions they are assigned&mdash;must be able to choose words that communicate the message they want to transmit. They have to be able to do it all the time, even in humdrum peacetime situations, so that they will be used to doing it all the time&mdash;and therefore will be able to do it under pressure, or even under fire.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, a wide variety of studies have found that a good vocabulary is one of the most common characteristics that successful people in all professions share. This doesn’t mean that you will automatically be successful if you have a good vocabulary, but it does suggest that it can help.</p>
<p class="indent">What’s more, the AFOQT will test you directly on your knowledge of what certain words mean. All three tests will indirectly measure if you know what words mean by your ability to follow their directions.</p>
<p class="indent">Since words are the building blocks or bricks of language, you need to be sure you have enough of the right kind of bricks to construct your message to do its job well. The bigger your vocabulary, the more ideas you can express accurately. To help you build your vocabulary, this section has hundreds of words you ought to know and be able to use correctly&mdash;especially if you want to have the credibility to lead other people.</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t forget, though, that the absolute best way to improve your vocabulary is to <span class="italic">read</span>. Read a newspaper, read magazines, read books&mdash;read about things you’re interested in, read about things you find you need to know about, but <span class="italic">rea</span><span class="italic">d</span>! Don’t worry about reading things that are way above your level; read things that are slightly <span class="italic">above</span> your level, and that level will go up.</p>
<p class="indent">The other half of this equation is that you have to <span class="italic">write</span>. No one said you have to write for publication&mdash;no one’s demanding that you win the Pulitzer Prize&mdash;but, in order for you to be able to apply what you’re learning by reading, you need to write, go through it yourself after it’s cooled off, and then have someone who is skilled and experienced in writing look at it and give you some pointers. It’s the only way you will learn what you need to know, and it’s the only way you will be able to significantly improve your vocabulary.</p>
<p class="indent">These words presented for your review are grouped into nouns, verbs, and adjectives. For each word, you’ll find today’s most common or widely used definition; however, that meaning may be a long way from the word’s original or literal meaning. Some words have an alternate meaning that will be useful for you to know. It would be a good idea to study other meanings of the words, as well as to practice using them in sentences; this will help you remember the words and be able to use them correctly when you really need them.</p>

Remember another useful adage from Mark Twain: “It’s not what we don’t know; it’s what we do know that ain’t so.”</span></p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Abbreviations</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Technical language for any given field often contains many abbreviations, and the military is a prime example. Fortunately, your flight aptitude test won’t require you to learn all the military’s abbreviations and acronyms (a word taken from the first letter or letters of a phrase; for instance, the term <span class="italic">scuba</span> is actually an acronym that stands for Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus). You will, however, need to be able to correctly use the most common abbreviations in everyday, official, and academic language&mdash;abbreviations that are often misused, misunderstood, or both.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent1"><span class="gotham-medium">A.D.</span> (often seen in small capitals as <span class="sc">A.D.</span> or <span class="sc">AD</span>) is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase <span class="italic">anno Domini</span>, “in the year of our Lord”; measures time after the birth of Christ as established in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="gotham-medium">ASAP</span> As Soon As Possible</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="gotham-medium">B.C.</span> (often seen in small capitals as <span class="sc">B.C.</span> or <span class="sc">BC</span>), “before Christ”</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="gotham-medium">B.C.E.</span> (often seen in small capitals as <span class="sc">B.C.E.</span> or <span class="sc">BCE</span>), “before Christian era” or “before common era”</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="gotham-medium">e.g.</span> is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase <span class="italic">exempli gratia</span>, which means “for example.” This is the abbreviation you use when you want to give an example of a group of items or ideas, as in, “Not all Christmas tree decorations are expensive&mdash;e.g., candy canes&mdash;but they can all become family heirlooms.”</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="gotham-medium">etc.</span> is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase <span class="italic">et cetera</span> which means “and so on”&mdash;or, literally, “and other things.” You should use etc. only after a series of at least two or three things, as in, “We unpacked the Christmas tree lights, ornaments, tinsel, etc.”</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="gotham-medium">ibid.</span> is short for the Latin term <span class="italic">ibidem</span>, meaning “in the same place.”</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="gotham-medium">i.e.</span> is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase <span class="italic">id est</span>, “in other words.” (This is the most misused abbreviation of the ones presented here.)</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="gotham-medium">op. cit.</span> is short for the Latin phrase <span class="italic">opere citato</span>, “in the work cited.”</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="gotham-medium">USS</span> in front of a ship’s name means it is a U.S. Navy vessel, a “United States Ship.”</p>

<p class="block1"><span class="italic">“Mathematics is a more powerful instrument of knowledge than <br class="calibre2" />any other that has been bequeathed to us by human agency.”</span></p>
<p class="blockr"><span class="italic">&mdash;</span><span class="italic">René Descartes, 1596&ndash;1650, French philosopher, <br class="calibre2" />mathematician, and scientist</span></p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="drop">T</span>his section reviews basic math terms and problem-solving methods taught in high school and basic college courses. You will find samples of math problems most often encountered in the various flight aptitude tests for the different services, with an explanation of how to solve each. You may find that you know one or more other ways to solve these problems, also&mdash;the more complex a math problem, the more chance that there’s more than one way to solve it.</p>
<p class="indent">Although there is a fair amount of basic concept review here, the chapter’s purpose is <span class="underline">not</span> to <span class="italic">teach</span> the concepts to you for the first time, but instead to remind you of “what right looks like.” If you are completely unfamiliar with any of the concepts addressed in this chapter, you will probably want to do some special-emphasis math studying or get some math-focused tutoring.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s something else to consider: Most of us are so accustomed to using calculators that doing some pencil-and-paper calculations would be worthwhile to knock off the mental rust. Yes, it’s a pain in the neck, and sure, you used to know how to do it&mdash;but why risk having a brain cramp during the test because you haven’t done long division in a long time? Practice like it’s game time and do it on paper&mdash;you won’t have a calculator on the test!</p>
<p class="indent">Before you study the information in this section, consider these suggestions for effective math problem solving (and this includes those pesky word problems!):</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">1.</span></span> Develop the habit of reading the problem carefully. Look for answers to these questions:</p>
<p class="list-at"><span class="bold"><span class="tcn">a.</span></span> What are the facts given in the problem?</p>
<p class="list-a"><span class="bold"><span class="tcn">b.</span></span> What is the unknown quantity or amount that the problem asks you to find? In what terms or units is it to be expressed (pure numbers, miles, square feet, number of children in the audience, etc.)?</p>
<p class="list-a"><span class="bold"><span class="tcn">c.</span></span> What method should you use to solve the problem? What is the best method or series of steps?</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">2.</span></span> Pay close attention to each word, number, and symbol. In math, directions and operations are usually compressed into a few words or symbols. The key to the problem or the principal direction can sometimes be expressed as a symbol.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">3.</span></span> How does one fact or idea lead to another? Which facts or ideas are connected, and which facts don’t really contribute to the solution of the problem?</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2938" class="calibre5"></a><a id="calibre_link-2421" href="#calibre_link-2521" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">MATHEMATICS LAWS AND OPERATIONS</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The numbers 0, 1, and 2 are <span class="italic">whole numbers</span>. So are 3, 4, 5, and so on; in comparison, <img src="images/00891.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> is a <span class="italic">fraction</span>, and 5<img src="images/00937.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> is a <span class="italic">mixed number</span>&mdash;a whole number plus a fraction. Mathematically speaking, when we combine two or more whole numbers, we call it performing an <span class="italic">operation</span> on them. Officially, there are two basic operations, <span class="italic">addition</span> and <span class="italic">multiplication</span>; <span class="italic">subtraction</span> is the opposite, or <span class="italic">inverse</span>, of addition, and <span class="italic">division</span> is the inverse of multiplication.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, we combine two or more individual numbers (24 + 2, for instance) to produce an answer called the <span class="italic">sum</span>. In multiplication, we combine groups of numbers to produce an answer called the <span class="italic">product</span>. An example of multiplication would be “eight times two” (8 <span class="normal">×</span> 2), which simply means eight groups of two, or counting two items eight times; the answer, or product, is 16.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Subtraction</span> and <span class="italic">division</span>, as mentioned earlier, are really opposite or inverse operations of addition and multiplication, respectively. Subtraction is performed to undo addition, and division is performed to undo multiplication. The answer in subtraction is called the <span class="italic">difference</span>; in division, it’s called the <span class="italic">quotient.</span> In both cases, we’re going to presume that you know how to perform these basic mathematics operations and move on to make sure you’re ready for your flight aptitude test.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Use of Parentheses: Order of Operations</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, math problems use parentheses to indicate which operation is supposed to be done first. For example, in the problem 3 + (5 <span class="normal">×</span> 2), you would first multiply 5 <span class="normal">×</span> 2, and then add 3. Look at the different results you get when you work without the parentheses and then with them.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00010.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre1" /></p>
<p class="indent">Even though we read a problem from left to right, there is an order in which we must perform arithmetic operations:</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">1.</span></span> First, do all the operations within parentheses.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">2.</span></span> Next, do all multiplications and divisions. Do these in left-to-right order.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">3.</span></span> Finally, do additions and subtractions.</p>
<p class="indentt1">In the following example, notice the order in which arithmetic operations are carried out.</p>
<table class="calibre20">
<tr class="calibre19">
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tcenter">(10 &ndash; 6) <span class="normal">×</span> 5	&ndash; (15 ÷ 5)</p></td>
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">=</p></td>

<p class="noindent">Sometimes, a problem will call for you to round off the answer to the nearest ten, hundred, thousand, etc. We do this in everyday conversation when we say that a steak dinner listed on the menu at $21.95 costs “about $20,” or that a laptop computer advertised at $695.99 was “about $700.” <span class="italic">Rounding off</span>, <span class="italic">estimating</span>, and <span class="italic">approximating</span> all mean the same thing: You are making a statement about the approximate value of a number.</p>
<p class="indent">When rounding off numbers, the first thing to do is to look at the way the number is constructed or organized, and the second thing to do is to determine the level of accuracy at which you want to express or talk about that number.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2939" class="calibre3"></a>Look at the way the number 282,535,321 is written below.</p>
<p class="center">282, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;535, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;321</p>
<p class="noindent1">Here we can see that the whole nine-digit number is divided up into three-number segments that are more easily dealt with&mdash;“eating the elephant one bite at a time,” so to speak. But let’s break this number down into its most understandable form:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00028.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre23" /></p>
<p class="indentt">If you need to round off 282,535,321 to the nearest hundred, you would first find the number in the “hundreds” row (3), and then look at the number to its right (2). If the number to the right is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, you round off the hundreds to the next higher number (4) and replace the 21 with 00. By the same token, if it’s <span class="italic">less</span> than 5, you would round <span class="italic">down</span>, as we do in this case&mdash;so we can say that 321 is <span class="italic">about</span> 300. Your answer would then be 282,535,300.</p>
<p class="indent">This same method works regardless of whether you go higher or lower within this particular number&mdash;and it works with any number, no matter how large or small. For instance, if we wanted to round 282,535,321 off to the nearest <span class="italic">million</span>, following the same procedure, since the first number to the right of the million is 5 or larger, we would round <span class="italic">up</span> the last “millions” number and replace everything to its right with zeros, giving us 283,000,000.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose your original amount was 763,219,846 and you needed to round this number to the nearest ten thousand. In this case, when you break down the number to its components, you find a 1 in the “ten thousands” position, and a 9 to its immediate right. Therefore, to round the complete number to the nearest ten thousand, we increase the 1 to a 2 and replace all numbers to its right with zeros, giving us 763,220,000.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Prime and Composite Numbers</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Whole numbers are classified as either <span class="italic">prime</span> or <span class="italic">composite</span> numbers<span class="italic">.</span> A prime number is a number greater than one that can be divided evenly by two numbers, itself and 1, but not by any other whole number.</p>
<p class="example"><img src="images/00053.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre1" /> EXAMPLES __________________________________________</p>
<p class="indentt">2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13</p>
<p class="indentt">A composite number is one that can be divided evenly by itself, by 1, and by at least one other whole number.</p>
<p class="example"><img src="images/00053.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre1" /> EXAMPLES __________________________________________</p>
<p class="indentt">4, 6, 10, 15, 27, 82</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Note:</span> The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2940" class="calibre5"></a><span class="bold1">Factors</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When a whole number has other divisors besides 1 and itself, these other divisors are called <span class="italic">factors.</span> In other words, factors are numbers we use to multiply to form a composite (whole) number. Sometimes you will be asked to “factor” a number&mdash;for example, 6. The factors of 6 are the numbers that you multiply to produce 6. Since 3 times 2 equals 6, the factors of 6 are 3 and 2.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Exponents</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The short way of writing <span class="italic">repeated factors</span> in multiplication&mdash;i.e., when a given number is multiplied by itself a certain number of times&mdash;is called using <span class="italic">exponents</span>. For example, you can write 5 <span class="normal">×</span> 5 as 5<span class="sup">2</span> or “five times five equals five squared.” The smaller 2 written to the right of and slightly above the 5 is called an <span class="italic">exponent</span>; it tells us that 5 is used twice as a factor. You can read 5<span class="sup">2</span> as either “5 to the second power” or “5 squared.” Note that 5<span class="sup">2</span> does <span class="italic">not</span> represent “five times two” (5 <span class="normal">×</span> 2). The expression 2<span class="sup">3</span> is read as “2 to the third power,” “2 to the power of 3,” or “2 cubed,” and represents 2 <span class="normal">×</span> 2 <span class="normal">×</span> 2.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1"><span class="italic1">n</span> Factorial</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Don’t confuse exponents (expressions of repeated factors) with the term <span class="italic">factorial.</span> When you see “5 factorial,” for example, it means “find the product of every number between 1 and 5 multiplied together.” Thus, “5 factorial” means 5 <span class="normal">×</span> 4 <span class="normal">×</span> 3 <span class="normal">×</span> 2 <span class="normal">×</span> 1. The symbol for 5 factorial is “5!”</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Reciprocal</span></p>
<p class="noindent">You may also need to find the <span class="italic">reciprocal</span> of a number. To find the reciprocal of 4, for instance, look for the number that you multiply by 4 to get 1. The easiest way to calculate this is to divide 1 by 4. You can express the answer either as <img src="images/00069.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> or as 0.25 (see the following sections on fractions and decimals). Remember that the product of a number and its reciprocal is always 1: the reciprocal of <img src="images/00069.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> is 4; the reciprocal of <img src="images/00091.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> is 2.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Series and Sequences</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A frequently asked type of test question involves a <span class="italic">series</span> or <span class="italic">sequence</span> of numbers. You are given several numbers arranged in a pattern, and are then asked to find the number that comes next. The way to solve this is to figure out the pattern; i.e., figure out what the relationship is between the first and second number, second and third, and so on. Try the following two examples:</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">(A)</span> 2, 4, 6, 8, ?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">(B)</span> 3, 9, 4, 8, ?</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="calibre_link-2941" class="calibre3"></a>Each number in Series <span class="bold">(A)</span> is 2 higher than the previous number. Thus, the next term in the series is 10. By testing the relationships between numbers in Series <span class="bold">(B)</span>, you find the following pattern:</p>
<table width="100%" class="calibre20">
<tr class="calibre19">
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">3 (+ 6) = 9</p></td>
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">The first step is “add 6.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre19">
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">9 (&ndash;5) = 4</p></td>
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">The next step is “subtract 5.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre19">
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">4 (+ 4) = 8</p></td>
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">The next step is “add 4.”</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">To continue the pattern, the next step will have to be “subtract 3.” Therefore, the next number in the series is 5.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2422" href="#calibre_link-2522" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">FRACTIONS</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Many problems in arithmetic have to do with fractions. (Decimals and percents are really just different ways of writing fractions.) There are at least four ways to think about fractions.</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">1.</span></span> A fraction is a part or fragment of a whole. The fraction <img src="images/00113.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> means that something has been divided into three parts, and we are working with two of those parts. The number written above the fraction line (2) is the <span class="italic">numerator</span>, and the number below it (3) is called the <span class="italic">denominator</span>.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">2.</span></span> A fraction can be the result of a multiplication operation. The fraction <img src="images/00134.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> means 3 times <img src="images/00069.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">3.</span></span> A fraction is an expression of division. Thus <img src="images/00153.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> is the quotient (result) when 2 is divided by 5. This can also be written as 2 ÷ 5.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">4.</span></span> A fraction is an expression of a ratio, which is a comparison between two quantities. For example, the ratio of 6 inches to 1 foot is <img src="images/00178.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, since there are 12 inches in a foot.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Performing Mathematical Operations with Fractions</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There are some special rules&mdash;and some shortcuts, too&mdash;for multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting fractions and mixed numbers. Remember, a <span class="italic">mixed number</span> is one that is made up of a whole number and a fraction&mdash;for example, 5<img src="images/00937.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">MULTIPLYING FRACTIONS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The general rule for multiplying two or more fractions is to multiply the numerators by each other, and then multiply the denominators by each other.</p>
<p class="example"><img src="images/00053.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre1" /> EXAMPLES __________________________________________</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="images/00196.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre1" /></p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> 1×3×5=15; 2×4×8=64</p>
<p class="indentt1">Sometimes, the product you get when you multiply two fractions can be expressed in simpler terms than what originally results from your calculations. When you express a fraction in its <span class="italic">lowest terms,</span> you put it in a form in which the numerator and denominator no longer have a common factor by which they can be divided.</p>
<p class="example"><a id="calibre_link-2942" class="calibre3"></a><img src="images/00053.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre1" /> EXAMPLES __________________________________________</p>

<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00244.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Find a number that is a factor of both 24 and 36. Result: Both numbers can be divided by 4.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00266.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Divide 24 by 4 and then divide 36 by 4.</p>
<p class="step1">24 ÷ 4 = 6</p>
<p class="step1">36 ÷ 4 = 9</p>
<p class="step1">Therefore, <img src="images/00289.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /></p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00307.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Check again. Is there a number that is a factor of both 6 and 9? Yes, both numbers can be divided by 3. Divide 6 and then 9 by 3.</p>
<p class="step1">6 ÷ 3 = 2</p>
<p class="step1">9 ÷ 3 = 3</p>
<p class="step1">Therefore, <img src="images/00337.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /></p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">ANSWER:</span> <img src="images/00358.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> can be reduced to the lowest terms of <img src="images/00113.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">CHANGING IMPROPER FRACTIONS TO MIXED NUMBERS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When the numerator of a fraction is larger than its denominator, it is called an <span class="italic">improper fraction.</span> An improper fraction can be changed to a mixed number.</p>
<p class="example"><img src="images/00053.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre1" /> EXAMPLES __________________________________________</p>
<p class="indent">Change <img src="images/00377.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> to a mixed number.</p>
<p class="indentt">Because a fraction is also another way to express division, <img src="images/00377.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> means 37 ÷ 5. If 37 is divided by 5, the quotient is 7, and the remainder is 2&mdash;or, expressed another way, <img src="images/00408.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">CHANGING MIXED NUMBERS TO IMPROPER FRACTIONS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To multiply or divide mixed numbers, it is necessary to change them into improper fractions.</p>
<p class="indentt1"><span class="bold">EXAMPLE</span><span class="bold">:</span> Change 8<img src="images/00426.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> to an improper fraction.</p>
<p class="indentt1">Convert the whole number, 8, to fifths: <img src="images/00452.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /></p>
<p class="indentt1"><img src="images/00466.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, an improper fraction. A shortcut for changing a number from a mixed number to an improper fraction is to multiply the whole part of the mixed number by the fraction’s denominator, and then add the result to the original numerator.</p>
<p class="indentt1">Therefore, <img src="images/00487.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />.</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-2943" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">MULTIPLYING MIXED NUMBERS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When multiplying or dividing with a mixed number, change the mixed number to an improper fraction before working out the problem.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00511.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw" /></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">CANCELLATION</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Cancellation</span> is a shortcut you can use when you’re multiplying or dividing fractions. For example, if you are going to multiply <img src="images/00533.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> times <img src="images/00560.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, you first multiply the numerators by each other, and then the denominators by each other; this gives you an answer you have to reduce to lowest terms.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00583.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw2" /></p>
<p class="indent">There’s an easier way to solve this problem: See if there is a number you can divide evenly into both a numerator and a denominator of the original problem. In this example, there is such a number: You can divide 8 into both itself and 16.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="images/00598.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw2" /></p>
<p class="indent">You can also divide 3 into the numerator 3 and the denominator 9. Having found this, solve the problem by multiplying the new numerators and then the new denominators.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="images/00632.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw2" /></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">DIVIDING FRACTIONS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Dividing fractions looks a lot like multiplying them, but there is an important extra consideration that we can use to manipulate the fractions in an equation: Dividing something by a number is the same as multiplying that something by 1 over that number. Therefore we can convert the division problem <img src="images/00650.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> into the multiplication problem <img src="images/00678.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />.</p>
<p class="indent">To divide with fractions, you have to <span class="italic">invert</span> the second fraction (turn it upside down), and then change the division sign to a multiplication sign and solve as a multiplication of fractions. This is also called multiplying the first fraction by the <span class="italic">recip</span><span class="italic">r</span><span class="italic">ocal</span> of the second fraction. Remember: Any whole number can be written as that number over 1; i.e., the number 5 can be written as <img src="images/00695.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, 3 can be written as <img src="images/00718.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00743.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw" /></p>
<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-2944" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">ADDING AND SUBTRACTING SIMPLE FRACTIONS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There are some basic rules for adding and subtracting fractions:</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">1.</span></span> Add or subtract only those fractions that have the same denominator.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">2.</span></span> Add or subtract only the numerators of the fractions, keeping the same denominator.</p>
<p class="bll"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">3.</span></span> If two fractions you want to combine by adding or subtracting do not have the same denominator (a <span class="italic">common denominato</span><span class="italic">r</span>), find a way to change them so that both denominators are the same.</p>
<p class="noindent">This last operation is easy if one of the denominators divides evenly into the other. To add <img src="images/00113.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> and <img src="images/00766.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, for instance, you can work with the fact that 3 goes into 6 evenly. You can change the <img src="images/00113.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> to <img src="images/00791.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, a fraction with the same value, and then work with the two fractions on an equitable basis.</p>
<p class="indent">If you can’t divide one of the denominators into the other, then you have to find a number that both denominators will go into evenly. If you are working with three fractions or even more, you have to find a number that all the denominators can divide into evenly.</p>
<p class="indent">For instance, if you need to add <img src="images/00069.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, <img src="images/00817.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, and <img src="images/00832.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, you need to find a common denominator that all three fractions can divide into evenly. One technique for finding a common denominator between several fractions is to take the largest denominator and start multiplying it by 2, 3, and so on, until you find a number that the other denominators will also divide into evenly. In this case, 6 is the largest denominator; multiply 6 times 2 and you get 12, a number that 5 does not divide into evenly. You have to keep trying until you reach 60, which is the first product that all three denominators divide into evenly.</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t forget&mdash;to convert a fraction expressed with one denominator, you have to multiply the numerator by the same number used to multiply the denominator.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s look at this example:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00861.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre25" /></p>
<p class="indent">Now add the converted fractions:</p>

<p class="imagel"><img src="images/00079.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The principles are the same when you subtract mixed numbers, but there are some additional wrinkles to watch out for. When you subtract mixed numbers, you may have to “borrow” in the same way that you do when you subtract whole numbers. For example, if you want to subtract 4<img src="images/00134.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> from 8<img src="images/00069.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, you realize you cannot take <img src="images/00134.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> from <img src="images/00069.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />. (Kind of difficult to get $.75 out of a quarter!) Therefore, you have to borrow 1 <img src="images/00906.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> expressed in this case as <img src="images/00126.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /><img src="images/00927.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> from 8, and rewrite the problem.</p>

<p class="indentt">You can tell what the denominator of a decimal fraction is by counting the places (not just the zeros) in the number to the right of its decimal point. When it is written as a fraction, the denominator has the same number of zeros as this number of places; that is, it has the same power of ten. For example:</p>

<p class="h2"><span class="bold">ADDING AND SUBTRACTING DECIMALS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To add or subtract decimals, line up the numbers so that the decimal points are directly under one another, then add or subtract in the same way that you would with whole numbers. Write zeros at the end of decimals if you find it easier to work with placeholders to keep things lined up.</p>
<p class="example"><img src="images/00053.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre1" /> EXAMPLES __________________________________________</p>
<p class="blockquote">Add the numbers 5.14, 11.7, 798.1, and 0.0327, and then subtract their sum from 2,790.59. Remember to include the decimal point in the answers.</p>

<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-2947" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">MULTIPLYING DECIMALS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To multiply two decimals, line them up from the right as though they were whole numbers, regardless of how many digits there are to the right of the decimal in either number. Count the number of places to the right of the decimal in each number, and then add them together. From right to left, count the same number of places in the answer as you got when you added the places together from the two numbers you multiplied&mdash;then insert a decimal point in the answer at that point.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00349.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw2" /></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">DIVIDING DECIMALS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To divide a decimal by a whole number, divide the numbers as though they were both whole numbers. Then place a decimal point in the answer directly above the decimal in the problem and solve the problem. Add zeros to the right of the dividend (the number inside the division sign) if you need to in order to finish the problem.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00393.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw3" /></p>
<p class="indent">To divide one decimal by another, begin by making the divisor a whole number. To do this, move the decimal to the far right of the number, and count the number of places that you move it. Then move the decimal in the dividend (the other number) the same number of places (in the same direction, of course!). For example:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00437.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre27" /></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">ROUNDING OFF DECIMALS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Many math problems require a process called <span class="italic">rounding off</span> to reach an answer, where one or more numbers are made shorter and therefore usually easier to deal with. The idea of rounding off also has to do with the accuracy or precision of the number or measurement&mdash;the longer the number (i.e., the more places used to the right of the decimal point), the more accurate or precise the number is considered to be.</p>
<p class="indentt1"><a id="calibre_link-2948" class="calibre3"></a>Let’s consider a measurement of 3.6 meters. Is this closer to 3 meters or to 4 meters? 3.6 = 3<img src="images/00478.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, which is closer to 4 meters than it is to 3 meters. But what about 3.5 meters? This is exactly midway between 3 and 4 meters. The common, widely accepted method of rounding off a number of this type is that anything that is halfway or more between one level or amount and another is rounded up to the higher level; anything lower than half is rounded down. This means that 3.5 and 3.6 are rounded <span class="italic">up</span> to 4, but that 3.3 and 3.4 are rounded <span class="italic">down</span> to 3, simply because they are closer.</p>
<p class="indentt1">This rounding principle works in the same way regardless of where you are looking at a number relative to the decimal point. Thus,</p>
<p class="indentt1">0.35 meters rounded to the nearest tenth of a meter is 0.4 meters (four-tenths of a meter)</p>
<p class="indent">3.6 meters rounded to the nearest meter is 4 meters</p>
<p class="indent">37 meters rounded to the nearest 10 meters is 40 meters</p>
<p class="indent">380 meters rounded to the nearest hundred meters is 400 meters</p>
<p class="indentt1">Also, when you have long numbers, it’s important to remember to do your rounding off from <span class="italic">right to left</span>. Look at the first number to the right of the position you must round to, and any number of 5 or higher elevates the number to its left, whereas any number of less than 5 is dropped, along with any further numbers to the right. For example:</p>
<p class="indentt1">3.39 meters rounded to the nearest tenth of a meter is 3.4 meters</p>
<p class="indent">3.49 meters rounded to the nearest tenth of a meter is 3.5 meters</p>
<p class="indent">3.49 meters rounded to the nearest meter is 3 meters</p>
<p class="indent">3.267919 meters rounded to the nearest tenth of a meter is 3.3 meters</p>
<p class="indent">3.9847769034 meters rounded to the nearest hundredth of a meter is 3.98 meters</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2424" href="#calibre_link-2524" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">PERCENTAGES</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="italic">percent</span> is a way to express a fraction that simply means a certain amount expressed in hundredths. To use a percent figure when solving a problem, change it to a fraction or a decimal. To change a percent to a fraction, drop the percent sign and multiply by <img src="images/00524.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00574.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw1" /></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Changing a Percent to a Decimal</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To change a percent figure to a decimal figure, drop the percent sign and move the decimal point two places to the left. Add extra zeros, if needed, to fill out the correct number of places. If the percent is given as a fraction, first change the fraction to a decimal. For example:</p>
<table width="100%" class="calibre20">
<tr class="calibre19">
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tright">4% = .04</p></td>
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">1.7% = .017</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre19">
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tright">55% = .55</p></td>
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">1/5% = .20% = .002</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre19">
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tright">17% = .17</p></td>
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">100% = 1.00 (or 1)</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2949" class="calibre5"></a><span class="bold1">Changing a Decimal to a Percentage</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To change a decimal to a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right and add the percent sign. For instance:</p>
<table width="100%" class="calibre20">
<tr class="calibre19">
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tright">0.47 = 47%</p></td>
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">0.03 = 3%</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre19">
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tright">0.008 = .8%</p></td>
<td class="calibre21"><p class="tleft">3.27 = 327%</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="indent">Percentages over 100% are often used to talk about an increase of twice as much or more.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2425" href="#calibre_link-2525" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">SQUARE ROOTS</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The square root of a number is one of the two <span class="underline">equal</span> factors (numbers) that, when multiplied together, result in that number. In other words, to find a square root, ask yourself, “What number multiplied by itself (squared) will yield the original number?”</p>
<p class="indent">For instance, the square root of 9 is 3, because 3 <span class="normal">×</span> 3 = 9, and the square root of 25 is 5, since 5 <span class="normal">×</span> 5 = 25.</p>
<p class="indent">The square root of a number is indicated by using a radical sign (<img src="images/00617.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />). For example, <img src="images/00661.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> means “the square root of 64,” or <img src="images/00661.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> = 8. In the same way, <img src="images/00706.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> = 6, <img src="images/00754.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> = 7, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Square roots are often complex in the sense that they may be very long numerically, and may, in fact, not be able to be expressed completely as a decimal number. Numbers that have <span class="italic">exact</span> square roots are called <span class="italic">perfect squares</span>. The perfect squares with which you are probably most familiar are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. Also, it’s worth remembering that a “gross” of something is a dozen dozens, or 144&mdash;so the square root of 144 is 12.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Finding the Square Root of a Number</span></p>
<p class="noindent">You may be asked to find the square root of a number that is not a perfect square, giving your answer rounded off to the nearest tenth, for example. You can use a trial-and-error method to find a square root to the nearest decimal place that the problem</p>
<p class="noindent">asks you for. For example, suppose you are asked to find <img src="images/00805.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> to the nearest tenth: <img src="images/00805.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> is between <img src="images/00846.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, which we know is 5, and <img src="images/00706.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />, which we know is 6. We can infer that <img src="images/00805.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> is closer to <img src="images/00846.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> than it is to <img src="images/00706.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />. So, to start, make an estimate (yes, a guess, but an informed, reasonable guess) that 5.2 is <img src="images/00805.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> to the nearest tenth, and then see how close you are by multiplying 5.2 <span class="normal">×</span> 5.2 and seeing that the result is 27.04&mdash;less than our goal of 28. Because that was too low, we can multiply 5.3 <span class="normal">×</span> 5.3 and see that the result is 28.09, which is pretty close but a little more than our goal of 28.</p>
<p class="indent">Because we now have a “bracket” of 28&mdash;one set of factors on each side, one more and one less&mdash;we know that the square root of 28 is between 5.2 and 5.3.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, we know that the actual exact <img src="images/00805.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> is closer to 5.3 than 5.2, so, since our objective was to find <img src="images/00805.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> rounded off to the nearest tenth, our job is done: The answer is 5.3.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2426" href="#calibre_link-2526" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">ALGEBRA</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Algebra is a way to express a problem or mathematical relationship with a small set of symbols used to substitute for actual numbers. This is because we don’t know what all the actual values are, or because the same relationship may apply to different sets of numbers.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2950" class="calibre3"></a>Let’s look at an example. We know that if a jacket is priced at $20, we have to pay $20 to buy one. If we want three jackets, we pay three times that amount, or $60. How do we find that answer of $60? We multiply two numbers together to find a third number. Using the style of algebra, we can express this operation briefly. Let <span class="italic">p</span> equal the price of one jacket, and let <span class="italic">c</span> (the “unknown”) equal the cost of three jackets. This is the algebraic expression for how we find <span class="italic">c</span>:</p>
<p class="center"><span class="italic">c</span> = 3 <span class="normal">×</span> <span class="italic">p</span> <span class="pad"></span>or <span class="pad"></span><span class="italic">c</span> = 3<span class="italic">p</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In this equation, the letters <span class="italic">c</span> and <span class="italic">p</span> are called <span class="italic">variables,</span> meaning that the numbers they stand for can change. In other words, if the price of the jacket is discounted to $18, then <span class="italic">p</span> will equal $18, and <span class="italic">c</span> will equal $54.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Arithmetic Operations in Algebra</span></p>
<p class="noindent">All four arithmetic operations are possible in algebra: both basic operations (addition and multiplication) and both inverse operations (subtraction and division). We can express these operations algebraically:</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">1.</span></span> The sum of two numbers <span class="italic">x</span> and <span class="italic">y</span> is <span class="italic">x</span> <span class="italic">+ y</span></p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">2.</span></span> The difference between two numbers <span class="italic">x</span> and <span class="italic">y</span> is <span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; <span class="italic">y</span></p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">3.</span></span> The product of two numbers, <span class="italic">x</span> and <span class="italic">y,</span> is (<span class="italic">x</span>) <span class="normal">×</span> (<span class="italic">y</span>) or <span class="italic">x</span> <span class="italic">· y</span> or <span class="italic">xy</span></p>
<p class="bll"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">4.</span></span> The quotient of two numbers <span class="italic">x</span> and <span class="italic">y</span> is <span class="italic">x</span> ÷ <span class="italic">y</span> or <img src="images/00892.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Equations</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="italic">equation</span> is a statement that two quantities are equal. This is easily understandable and obvious when the quantities are expressed in numbers, such as these:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00938.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre27" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">In algebra, however, equations will include <span class="italic">variables</span> (a letter or sign that can stand for more than one value) or <span class="italic">unknowns</span> (a letter or sign that stands for a quantity or idea that we don’t know yet). Usually, you will be asked to <span class="italic">solve the equation</span> by finding or <span class="italic">solving for</span> the unknown number value, often represented as the letter <span class="italic">x</span>. In this sense, the <span class="italic">solution</span> to an equation is the number that proves that the equation is true, and you show that it’s true by substituting the number for the variable. But how do you find the number?</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose you heard somebody say, “I can’t afford to pay cash to buy a car for $9,000; that would leave me with only $500 to pay my bills for the rest of the month.” What we don’t know here is how much that person had originally; the other numbers are provided or given to us. How would we express his statement algebraically? (Remember, the “unknown” is the unstated amount <span class="italic">x</span> now in the bank account.) Here’s one way of writing the expression:</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; $9,000 = $500</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2951" class="calibre3"></a>Now, how do we solve for <span class="italic">x</span>, the unknown?</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00244.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about what the expression now means: A certain number minus $9,000 equals $500.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00266.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Decide how you want to express the solution: In this case, we have decided that <span class="italic">x</span> = the amount originally in the bank before we do any car buying or bill paying.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00307.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;For your solution, think about how to get the unknown <span class="italic">x</span> by itself on one side of the equal sign. This means you will have to manipulate the entire equation by performing the same operations on both sides of the equal sign to get <span class="italic">x</span> by itself. How do we clear the $9,000 from the side that shows <span class="italic">x</span>? Notice that the sign in front of $9,000 is a minus sign. Saying “<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; $9,000” is the same as saying “<span class="italic">x</span> + (&ndash;$9,000),” otherwise known as adding a negative number to a positive number. So, if you <span class="italic">add</span> $9,000 to the left side of the equation, the two $9,000s will cancel each other out. However, remember that, because it’s an <span class="italic">equation</span>, everything has to stay equal or balanced; this means that whatever you do to the left side of the equation you have to do to the right side&mdash;otherwise it wouldn’t be an equation. If you add $9,000 to the left, you have to add it to the right. This, then, is how it looks:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00011.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre1" /></p>
<p class="indent">How did we solve this equation? By performing an inverse operation on both sides of the equation. To solve for <span class="italic">x</span>, we went through three steps:</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00244.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to solve for <span class="italic">x</span> by removing all other operations from the side of the equation where <span class="italic">x</span> is&mdash;we have to isolate <span class="italic">x</span>, or get <span class="italic">x</span> “by itself.”</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00266.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;We removed an operation (in this case, adding negative $9,000) from one side of the equal sign by performing its inverse or opposite operation (adding a positive $9,000) on the same side.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00307.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;We then performed the same operation on the other side of the equal sign. This resulted in isolating <span class="italic">x</span> on one side of the equation, which tells us that <span class="italic">x</span> equals $9,500.</p>
<p class="indentt">This, then, is generally how we solve equations: We perform operations to both sides of the equation that will result in the unknown being “alone” on one side of the equation&mdash;and the other side of the equal sign shows us the answer.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">OPERATIONS WITH MORE COMPLEX EQUATIONS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, an equation shows <span class="italic">x</span> as part of more than one operation. There may also be negative terms (terms with a minus sign). The same basic steps are involved in finding the solution, but may have to be repeated. Remember, the goal is always to isolate <span class="italic">x</span> on one side of the equation. Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="eqn">3<span class="italic">x</span> + 7 = &ndash;11</p>
<p class="step"><a id="calibre_link-2952" class="calibre3"></a><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00244.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform the inverse operation of + 7.</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="pad"></span>3<span class="italic">x</span> + 7 &ndash; 7 = &ndash;11 &ndash; 7<br class="calibre2" />3<span class="italic">x</span> = &ndash;18</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00266.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform the inverse operation of 3<span class="italic">x</span>, which can also be expressed as (3 · <span class="italic">x</span>); using the dot (·) instead of the multiplication sign (<span class="normal">×</span>) can sometimes help reduce confusion by reducing the number of <span class="italic">x</span>s in the equation.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00029.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw3" /></p>
<p class="indent">Remember, in multiplication and division, if the signs of both terms are plus or minus (positive or negative), the answer has a plus or positive sign. If the two terms are different, the answer has a minus or negative sign.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes, <span class="italic">x</span> appears on both sides of the original equation. In that case, the first step is to remove or factor out <span class="italic">x</span> from one side (also known as “collecting all <span class="italic">x</span>s on one side”) of the equal sign.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Algebraic Expressions</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="italic">algebraic expression</span> is any collection of numbers and variables. This collection may have more than one variable. For example, 2<span class="italic">x</span> + 3<span class="italic">y</span> is an algebraic expression meaning, “2 times one unknown number (<span class="italic">x</span>) plus 3 times another unknown number (<span class="italic">y</span>).”</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Arithmetic Operations with Algebraic Expressions</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To add or subtract algebraic expressions, remember that only <span class="italic">similar</span> or <span class="italic">“like”</span> terms can be combined. Terms are similar if they have the same variable, raised to the same power. For instance, we can subtract 3<span class="italic">x</span> from 5<span class="italic">x</span> to get 2<span class="italic">x</span>, but we cannot get <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">3</span> by adding <span class="italic">x</span> and <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span>, or get 9<span class="italic">zh</span> from adding 4<span class="italic">z</span> and 5<span class="italic">h</span>. For example, simplify the following series of terms:</p>
<p class="eqn">3<span class="italic">x</span> + 2<span class="italic">y</span> &ndash; 4<span class="italic">z</span> + 2<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 5<span class="italic">y</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Start by arranging like terms together and combining them.</p>
<p class="eqn">3<span class="italic">x</span> + 2<span class="italic">x</span> = 5<span class="italic">x</span> (first partial sum)<br class="calibre2" />2<span class="italic">y</span> &ndash; 5<span class="italic">y</span> = &ndash;3<span class="italic">y</span> (second partial sum)</p>
<p class="noindent">Therefore, the simplified expression is 5<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 3<span class="italic">y</span> &ndash; 4<span class="italic">z</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">To multiply algebraic expressions, first multiply the numbers of similar terms, then multiply the variables (letters) of similar terms. When you multiply one power of <span class="italic">x</span> by another power of <span class="italic">x</span>, just add the exponents together. For instance:</p>
<p class="eqn">(3<span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span>) (4<span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">3</span>)</p>
<p class="eqn">3 <span class="normal">×</span> 4 = 12 (first partial product)<br class="calibre2" /><span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> · <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">3</span> = <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">5</span> (second partial product)</p>
<p class="noindent">Therefore, the product is 12<span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">5</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The rules for multiplying more complex algebraic equations are basically the same&mdash;just take things step by step and stay organized. In the expression <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span><span class="italic">y</span>(2<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 3<span class="italic">y</span>), the parentheses mean that <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span><span class="italic">y</span> is the multiplier for both 2<span class="italic">x</span> and &ndash;3<span class="italic">y</span>, so we work out the expression like this:</p>
<p class="eqn"><a id="calibre_link-2953" class="calibre3"></a><span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span><span class="italic">y</span>(2<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 3<span class="italic">y</span>)<br class="calibre2" /><span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span><span class="italic">y</span>(2<span class="italic">x</span>) + <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span><span class="italic">y</span>(&ndash;3<span class="italic">y</span>)</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Evaluating Algebraic Expressions</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To <span class="italic">evaluate</span> an algebraic expression means to replace the variables with numbers (usually given to you), and then simplify the expression by adding, multiplying, and so on. For instance, evaluate the expression (<span class="italic">x</span> + 2<span class="italic">a</span>) if <span class="italic">x</span> = 3 and <span class="italic">a</span> = 2.</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="italic">x</span> + 2<span class="italic">a</span> = 3 + 2(2) = 3 + 4 = 7</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Factoring in Algebra</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, you are given the answer to an algebraic multiplication problem and are then asked to find the original multipliers; this is called <span class="italic">factoring.</span> These kinds of problems can be of different types:</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Type 1: Factor the Highest Common Factor</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The highest common factor of an algebraic expression is the highest expression that will divide into every one of the terms of the expression.</p>
<p class="example"><img src="images/00053.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre1" /> EXAMPLES __________________________________________</p>
<p class="noindent">6<span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> + 3<span class="italic">xy</span></p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00244.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest number that will divide into the numerical coefficients, 6 and 3, is 3.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00266.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest literal factor that will divide into <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> and <span class="italic">xy</span> is <span class="italic">x</span>. Notice that <span class="italic">y</span> is not contained in the first term at all.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00307.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Divide the highest common factor, 3<span class="italic">x</span>, into 6<span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> + 3<span class="italic">xy</span> to find the remaining factor. When we do this, we find that the factors are 3<span class="italic">x</span>(2<span class="italic">x</span> + <span class="italic">y</span>).</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Type 2: Factor the Difference of Two Squares</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This type of problem contains the square of one number minus the square of another number. Remember, the square of a number is the product that you get when you multiply a number by itself, and the square root of a number is the number that was multiplied by itself to get the square or original number. For example:</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2954" class="calibre3"></a>Find the difference of two squares for <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> &ndash; 9.</p>

The square root of <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span>, of course, is <span class="italic">x</span>.</p>
<p class="eqn">(<span class="italic">x</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (<span class="italic">x</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00266.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Find the square root of 9 and place it on the right within each of the two parentheses you’ve set up. The square root of 9 is 3.</p>
<p class="eqn">(<span class="italic">x</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) (<span class="italic">x</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3)</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00307.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Put a plus sign between one pair of terms, and a minus sign between the other pair of terms.</p>
<p class="eqn">(<span class="italic">x</span> + 3) (<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 3)</p>
<p class="noindent">The factors of <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> &ndash; 9 are (<span class="italic">x</span> + 3), (<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 3).</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Type 3: Factor a Quadratic Trinomial</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A quadratic trinomial is an algebraic expression of the form <span class="italic">a</span><span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> + <span class="italic">bx + c,</span> where <span class="italic">a, b,</span> and <span class="italic">c</span> are numbers and <span class="italic">a</span> does not equal zero. Its factors are always two pairs of terms. The terms in each pair are separated by a plus or minus sign.</p>
<p class="example"><img src="images/00053.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre1" /> EXAMPLES __________________________________________</p>
<p class="noindent">Factor <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> &ndash; 11<span class="italic">x</span> + 30.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00244.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up your two shell sets of parentheses, then find the factors of the first term in the trinomial; again, the factors of <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> are <span class="italic">x</span> and <span class="italic">x</span>.</p>
<p class="eqn">(<span class="italic">x</span> <span class="pad"></span>) (<span class="italic">x</span> <span class="pad"></span>)</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00266.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the last term in the trinomial, which in this case has a plus sign. We now have to find the factors of the third term; because it is positive, we know that the factors are either both positive or both negative. Because the middle term is negative, we know that the factors must both be negative.</p>
<p class="eqn">(<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; <span class="pad"></span>) (<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; <span class="pad"></span>)</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00307.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Find factors of the last term that will also add to get the number of the second term. In this case, although we know that 30 has several factors, only the factors 5 and 6 also add up to 11, which is the numerical part of the second term. We already know that both factors have to be negative, so the factors of 30 we are looking for are actually &ndash;5 and &ndash;6.</p>
<p class="eqn">(<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 5) (<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 6)</p>
<p class="noindent">Therefore, for our solution, the factors of <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> &ndash; 11<span class="italic">x</span> + 30 are (<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 5), (<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 6).</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Solving Quadratic Equations</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="italic">quadratic equation</span> is an equation that contains a term with the square of the unknown quantity and has no term with a higher power of the unknown. In a quadratic equation, the <a id="calibre_link-2955" class="calibre3"></a>exponent is never higher than 2 (<span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span>, <span class="italic">b</span><span class="sup">2</span>, <span class="italic">c</span><span class="sup">2</span>, etc.). Examples of quadratic equations include the following:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00054.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">To solve equations like this, factor them, and then set each factor equal to zero. After that, it’s easy to solve for <span class="italic">x</span>. Let’s take it step by step.</p>
<p class="indent">Solve: <span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">2</span> = 3<span class="italic">x</span> + 10</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00244.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Move all the terms onto one side of the equal sign so that the equation on that side is equal to nothing on the other side&mdash;in other words, zero.

<p class="eqn">(<span class="italic">x</span> &ndash; 5)(<span class="italic">x</span> + 2) = 0</p>
<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00307.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set each factor equal to zero, then solve the resulting equations.</p>

<p class="step"><span class="stepa"><img src="images/00092.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre24" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;To check the accuracy of the answer, substitute each answer in the original equation.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00114.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre29" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The solution of the quadratic equation is proven to be <span class="italic">x</span> = 5, &ndash;2.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2427" href="#calibre_link-2527" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">GEOMETRY</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Geometry is a useful tool in our world. Geometry problems require knowledge of both the principles and application of arithmetic and algebra to arrive at the correct solution. Many geometry problems require you to make or infer some kind of measurement; they also use familiar terms such as <span class="italic">line</span>, <span class="italic">angle</span>, and <span class="italic">point</span>.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Lines</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="italic">line</span> is made up of <span class="italic">points</span>; it can have a definite length, or it can be infinitely long. For the purposes of our geometry problems, a line has no particular width. <span class="italic">Parallel lines</span> are lines that are equidistant (the same distance) from each other at every point along both lines so that, even if they were infinitely long, they would never touch.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00135.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw1" /></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2956" class="calibre3"></a><span class="italic">Perpendicular lines</span> are lines that meet to form a right angle (90 degrees).</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00154.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw1" /></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Angles</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When two lines meet at a point, they form an <span class="italic">angle</span>. The point where the lines meet is called the <span class="italic">vertex</span> of the angle. Angles can be named or designated in one of three ways:</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">1.</span></span> For the point at the vertex (in this case, angle Y).</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00179.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw1" /></p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">2.</span></span> For the letter names of the lines that meet to form the angle, with the vertex in the middle (in this example, angle XYZ).</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00197.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre30" /></p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">3.</span></span> For a number written or displayed inside the angle (in the diagram below, angle #3).</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00224.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre30" /></p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2957" class="calibre5"></a><span class="bold1">Measuring Angles</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The best way to measure an angle is with a <span class="italic">protractor</span>. Angles are measured in <span class="italic">degrees</span>, up to 180°. Remember that a circle has 360°, and that half of that circle would be a semicircle with its bottom edge going from edge to edge through the middle of the circle. So we see that two lines joined at a “180° angle” would be no angle at all, but instead just one line joined to the other as a straight-out continuation.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00245.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre30" /></p>
<p class="indent">So, as we see the possible measures of an angle from 0° to 180°, we need to know that each degree is divided into 60 minutes (designated by a tick mark like this ′), and each minute of a degree is further divided into 60 seconds of arc (designated by a double tick mark ″).</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00267.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre31" /></p>
<p class="indent">Further, we need to remember that a <span class="italic">right angle</span> is an angle of 90 degrees.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00290.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre32" /></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2958" class="calibre3"></a>Next, we need to remember that an <span class="italic">obtuse angle</span> is an angle measuring more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees . . .</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00308.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre32" /></p>
<p class="indent">. . . and that an <span class="italic">acute angle</span> is one measuring more than 0 degrees but less than 90 degrees.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00338.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre32" /></p>
<p class="indent">We also need to remember that <span class="italic">complementary angles</span> are two angles that have measurements that add up to 90 degrees (a right angle) . . .</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00359.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre32" /></p>
<p class="indent">. . . and that <span class="italic">supplementary angles</span> are angles whose measurements add up to 180 degrees.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Polygons</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="italic">polygon</span> is made up of three or more lines that are connected so that an area is enclosed. There are, technically, an infinite number of different types of polygons; here are some of the most common:</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">1.</span></span> A <span class="italic">triangle</span> has three sides.</p>

<p class="h2"><span class="bold">TRIANGLES</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="italic">triangle</span> is a polygon with three straight sides. There are several ways to categorize triangles, but all triangles have three angles, and their measurements add up to 180 degrees.</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="bold"><span class="nl">1.</span></span> An <span class="italic">equilateral triangle</span> is one where all three sides are of equal length, and whose angles are also equal at 60 degrees each.</p>

<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">2.</span></span> An <span class="italic">isosceles triangle</span> is one in which only two sides are equal; this results in the angles opposite those sides also being equal.</p>

<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">6.</span></span> A <span class="italic">right triangle</span> is one that includes one angle of exactly 90 degrees.

The other two sides of a right triangle are called <span class="italic">legs</span>.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00534.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre32" /></p>
<p class="indent">A very important, useful concept associated with right triangles is the <span class="italic">Pythagorean theorem</span>. This says that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. This is expressed in an equation like this:</p>

<p class="nl1"><span class="gotham-medium"><span class="nl">9.</span></span> A special way to work with triangles is to calculate an <span class="italic">altitude</span>. In the diagram below, <span class="italic">BD</span> is an altitude . . .</p>

<p class="indentt"><span class="italic">C</span> = π<span class="italic">d</span> (the circumference is equal to pi times the diameter)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">C</span> = π2<span class="italic">r</span> (the circumference is equal to pi times twice the radius)</p>
<p class="indentt">Because π is an infinite, nonrepeating decimal, we can either approximate π’s value by rounding it to 3.1415926 or even 3.14 for most problems. If a fraction is more appropriate, then we use the approximation <img src="images/00833.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />.</p>
<p class="indent">The area of a circle also has an unchanging relationship to π: The area of a circle equals π multiplied by the square of the radius, or</p>
<p class="eqn">A = π(<span class="italic">r</span><span class="sup">2</span>)</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Volume</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Volume is the total, three-dimensional space occupied by a solid object, which has (for our mathematical purposes) flat sides of <span class="italic">length</span>, <span class="italic">width</span>, and <span class="italic">depth</span>. Volume measurements are expressed in <span class="italic">cubic</span> units. Therefore, the equation for the volume of a rectangular object is</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2964" class="calibre3"></a>A <span class="italic">cube</span> is a solid whose length, width, and height are all the same&mdash;a three-dimensional square. The volume of a cube is one side raised to the third power, i.e., one side multiplied by itself, then the result multiplied by itself again.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00880.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre32" /></p>
<p class="indent">A solid where both bases are circles in parallel planes is called a <span class="italic">cylinder</span>. The volume of a cylinder is the area of its base (which is a circle) multiplied by its height, or, expressed mathematically:</p>

<p class="indent">A <span class="italic">sphere</span> is a perfectly round, three-dimensional object (e.g., a round ball). The volume of a sphere is found by multiplying <img src="images/00928.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" /> times π times the cube of the radius.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="drop">T</span>his chapter will provide you with information on aviation basics and nautical knowledge. This will help you on the AFOQT’s Instrument Comprehension and Aviation Information subtests; the SIFT’s Army Aviation Information subtest; and the ASTB-E’s Aviation and Nautical Information subtest. It will also give you important background and context specific to U.S. military aviation to help you understand questions in many of the other subtests.</p>

<p class="noindent">To do well on any of the aviation sections of these tests, you should have some basic knowledge of how airplanes and helicopters fly. It’s a good idea, after you do some basic research of your own at the library or on the Internet, to take some time to visit an airport and talk with pilots to get some basic information about how to fly a plane. Even better, go through this book, write down any questions with which you had problems, and then ask the pilots for help. A hands-on demonstration will definitely help you remember the material.</p>
<p class="indent">This section covers the basics of flight for both fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, including how aircraft are constructed; flight instruments and controls; flight theory and the flight envelope; basic aviation terminology; and basic flight maneuvers. We will go through this sequence with fixed-wing aircraft, then come back and revisit how rotary-wing aircraft are similar and how they are different.</p>
<p class="indent">While you’re working your way through this section, make a note when you come to a concept that you don’t fully understand based on the explanation in that particular section, but try to continue: Some ideas have to be explained one piece at a time, and the explanation will become clearer as you go along. For instance, it’s impossible to explain aircraft controls without mentioning the control surfaces and what they do, but explaining what they do isn’t very clear until you know what the three axes of movement are, which in turn don’t make much sense unless explained in the context of cockpit controls and the airplane’s control surfaces.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s like listening to a class on a subject that’s new to you, but having to wait until the end to ask any questions. Many of the questions you have will be answered as the information is explained, part by part. If you get to the end, however, and some ideas aren’t clear yet, go back to that section and reread it; you will probably understand it better now that you have some of the other pieces of the puzzle in place. If that idea is still not clear to you, talk to a licensed pilot or do some more research on your own. You’ll get it.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.1</span> Basic fixed-wing aircraft construction</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Fuselage</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">fuselage</span> or body of the airplane contains the cockpit, from which the pilots and flight crew control the aircraft’s operations; the cabin, if the airplane carries any passengers; the cargo area if there is one; and attachment points for other major airplane components, such as the wings, tail section, and landing gear.</p>
<p class="indent">Single-engine propeller-driven airplanes usually have the engine in the front of the fuselage. There is a fireproof partition called a <span class="italic">firewall</span> between the engine compartment and the cockpit/cabin to protect the crew and passengers (if any) from a fire in the engine.</p>
<p class="indent">The two general design types of fuselage construction are <span class="italic">truss</span> and <span class="italic">monocoque</span>. Truss construction fuselages use steel or aluminum tubing in a series of triangular shapes (called trusses) to get the necessary strength and rigidity. Monocoque designs use bulkheads, stringers (running the length of the fuselage), and formers (perpendicular to the stringers) of various sizes and shapes to support a stretched or “stressed” skin.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Wings</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The wings are airfoils attached to each side of the fuselage that serve as the main lifting surfaces supporting the airplane in flight. An <span class="italic">airfoil</span> is an aircraft part or surface (such as a <a id="calibre_link-2967" class="calibre3"></a>wing, propeller blade, or rudder) that controls lift, direction, stability, thrust, or propulsion for the aircraft. Modern aircraft may have any one of a wide variety of wing designs, shapes, and sizes, based on the aircraft’s purpose and design capabilities; the different types of wing shapes provide different capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages, but they all work basically the same way (we’ll get into that shortly).</p>
<p class="indent">Wings may be attached to the fuselage at the top, middle, or bottom (hence the terms <span class="italic">high-wing</span>, <span class="italic">mid-wing</span>, and <span class="italic">low-wing</span>). How many wings an airplane has can also vary, but this is counted in pairs or sets (wouldn’t want to have an airplane with only a left wing, for instance); airplanes with one set of wings are <span class="italic">monoplanes</span>, and those with two sets (usually stacked vertically) are called <span class="italic">biplanes</span>. There were a few triplanes early in the airplane’s history, but you won’t see them any more; there are still a few types of biplanes around (usually crop dusters and the like), but almost all planes today are monoplanes.</p>
<p class="indent">In terms of bracing and support, wings fall into one of two major categories, <span class="italic">cantilever</span> or <span class="italic">semi-cantilever</span>. A cantilever wing requires no external bracing, getting its support from internal wing spars, ribs, and stringers, as well as the construction of the wing’s skin or covering. A semi-cantilever wing requires both internal bracing and external support from struts attached to the fuselage.</p>
<p class="indent">Attached to the rear (trailing) edges of the wings are two sets of control surfaces known as <span class="italic">ailerons</span> and <span class="italic">flaps</span> (see <a href="#calibre_link-2531" class="calibre3">Figure 7.1</a>). Ailerons extend from about the middle of the wing out toward the wingtip; they move in opposite directions to create aerodynamic forces that cause the airplane to roll. Flaps extend outward from near where the wing joins the fuselage (called the <span class="italic">wing root</span>) to about the middle of the wing’s trailing edge. The flaps are usually flush with the rest of the wing surface during cruising (constant speed, neither climbing nor diving) flight; when they are extended, the flaps move downward together to increase the lift of the wing for takeoffs and landings.</p>
<p class="indent">In the flight theory section, we’ll discuss in more detail how wings generate lift. For right now, though, let’s hit the high points of how wings are shaped. First, we’ll look at a cross section of a conventional wing shape or <span class="italic">airfoil</span>.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-2532"><img src="images/00127.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.2</span> Airfoil cross section</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Airfoil shapes are found on wings, fans, and propellers&mdash;any application where air needs to be moved. The airfoil shape provides lift when it splits the airstream through which it is moving. An airfoil usually has a somewhat thicker, rounded, front or leading edge, and a thinner trailing edge. In between the leading and trailing edge, an airfoil is curved; the top <a id="calibre_link-2968" class="calibre3"></a>surface usually has a greater curve than the bottom surface. When a surface is curved, we say it has <span class="italic">camber</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The popular explanation of how an airfoil or wing generates lift is based on Bernoulli’s Principle. Because the top surface of the wing has more camber than the bottom surface, the air flows faster over the top of the wing than it does underneath. This means that there is less air pressure above the wing than there is underneath; the difference in air pressure above and below the wing causes lift. The primary advantages of the popular explanation of how lift occurs are (a) it’s easy to understand, and (b) it has been taught for many years. Some of the questions you will see on your service’s flight aptitude test may refer to this explanation, which is in fact more or less adequate at low speeds. However, we will see later in the flight theory section that the actual explanation for how lift occurs is based more on Newton’s Laws than on Bernoulli’s Principle.</p>
<p class="indent">Different airfoil shapes generate different amounts of lift and drag. If an airplane is designed to fly at low speeds (below 100 mph), it will have a different airfoil shape than an airplane designed to fly at supersonic speed (above about 761 mph). That’s because the airflow behaves in slightly different ways at different speeds and at different altitudes. In general, low- to medium-speed airplanes have airfoils with more thickness and camber.</p>
<p class="indent">The distance from the leading edge of the wing to the trailing edge is called the <span class="italic">chord</span>; the line from the middle of the leading edge to the trailing edge (as depicted in <a href="#calibre_link-2532" class="calibre3">Figure 7.2</a>) is the <span class="italic">chord line</span>, which cuts the airfoil into an upper surface and a lower surface. If we plot the points that lie halfway between the upper and lower surfaces, we obtain a curve called the <span class="italic">mean camber line</span>. For a symmetric airfoil, where the upper surface has the same shape as the lower surface, the mean camber line is the same as the chord line&mdash;but in most cases, since the airfoil surface has less curvature on the bottom than the top, these are two separate lines. The maximum distance between the two lines is called the <span class="italic">camber</span>, which is a measure of the curvature of the airfoil (high camber means high curvature); the maximum distance between the upper and lower surfaces is called the <span class="italic">thickness</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The ends of the wings are called the <span class="italic">wingtips</span>, and the distance from one wingtip to the other is called the <span class="italic">wingspan</span>. The shape of the wing viewed from above is called a <span class="italic">planform</span>. For a rectangular wing, the chord length at every location along the span is the same. For most other planforms, the chord length varies along the span.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.3</span> Front wing view showing dihedral</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The front view of this wing shows that the left and right wings aren’t truly horizontal (i.e., perpendicular to the fuselage), but instead meet at an angle called the <span class="italic">dihedral angle</span>. Dihedral is built into the design for roll stability; a wing with some dihedral will naturally return to its original position if it encounters a slight displacement. You may have noticed that most large airliner wings are designed with dihedral&mdash;you can tell by the fact that the <a id="calibre_link-2970" class="calibre3"></a>wingtips are higher off the ground than the wing roots. Highly maneuverable fighter planes, on the other hand, don’t have dihedral; in fact, some fighters have wingtips lower than the roots (called <span class="italic">anhedra</span><span class="italic">l</span>), giving the aircraft a higher roll rate.</p>
<p class="indent">Different wing planforms have different uses, characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. An airplane’s speed, maneuverability, and handling qualities are all very dependent on the shape of the wings. There are three basic wing types used on modern airplanes: straight, sweep, and delta.</p>
<p class="indent">Straight wings are mostly found on small, low-speed airplanes, as well as gliders and sailplanes. These wings give the most efficient lift at low speeds, but are not very good for high-speed flight, especially when approaching the speed of sound.</p>
<div class="keep">

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.4</span> Straight-wing designs</p>
</div>
<p class="indentt">The swept wing (either swept back or forward-swept) is the most common design for modern high-speed airplanes. The swept-wing design creates less drag than straight-wing designs, but is somewhat more unstable at low speeds. A sharply swept wing delays the formation of shock waves as the airplane nears the speed of sound. How much sweep a wing design is given depends on the design purpose for the airplane. A commercial jetliner has a moderate sweep, resulting in less drag while maintaining stability at lower speeds. High-speed aircraft like fighter planes have wings with a greater sweep, which do not generate much lift during low-speed flight and require relatively high-speed takeoffs and landings.</p>

<p class="indentt"><a id="calibre_link-2973" class="calibre3"></a>A delta wing looks like a large triangle viewed from above. It has a high angle of sweep with a straight trailing edge. Airplanes with this type of wing design are designed to reach supersonic speeds, and also land at high speeds. This type of planform was found on the supersonic transport Concorde and the shuttle Orbiters, as well as some experimental aircraft and European fighters; the delta wing design was also used on the now-obsolete F-102 Delta Dart and F-106 Delta Dagger American fighters and the B-58 Hustler bomber.</p>

</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Landing Gear</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The landing gear provides the main support for the airplane when it is on the ground. Landing gear usually consists of three wheels or sets of wheels&mdash;sometimes more for large or special-purpose aircraft&mdash;but airplanes can also be equipped with skis for landing on snow and ice, or floats to land on water.</p>
<p class="indent">Landing gear can be either retractable or nonretractable. Retractable gear can be mechanically pulled up into a cavity designed for them, with a door or doors closing over the opening to reduce drag and improve the airplane’s performance. Nonretractable landing gear usually has fairings over the top half to reduce drag and improve the airplane’s performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Two of the three wheels or sets of wheels are mounted either under the wings or at the outside edges of the fuselage. Sets of wheels, rather than single wheels, perform the same function as dual wheels on the back of a pickup truck or tractor-trailer rig: They support more weight. A few very large cargo and passenger airplanes even have more than two sets of landing gear, each with multiple wheels, mounted at the outside edges of the fuselage.</p>
<p class="indent">The third wheel or set of wheels is normally mounted either under the tail of the airplane or at the nose. Landing gear using a tailwheel is often called <span class="italic">conventional landing gear</span>, or the planes that have such landing gear may be referred to as <span class="italic">tailwheel airplanes</span>. Designs with the third wheel under the nose (a <span class="italic">nosewhee</span><span class="italic">l</span>) are commonly called <span class="italic">tricycle landing gear</span>. <a id="calibre_link-2975" class="calibre3"></a>In either case, a steerable tailwheel or nosewheel allows the airplane to be controlled during ground movement.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Powerplant</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There are two main types of fixed-wing aircraft propulsion systems we will discuss here: propellers and jets. Propeller- or “prop”-driven planes get their <span class="italic">thrust</span> by the corkscrew action of one or more propellers with two or more blades each rotating very fast at the front of the engine, which pushes air backward with the result that the airplane is “pushed” forward in accordance with Newton’s Third Law. The propeller blades are curved or slanted in a certain way to achieve this effect, and often the amount of the slant or <span class="italic">pitch</span> is variable&mdash;that is, the pilot can control just how much “pull” or <span class="italic">thrust</span> he wants the propeller to exert. Various designs, including the Wright brothers’ original 1903 model, have placed the propeller at the back of the plane, resulting in the name <span class="italic">pusher prop</span>, but these are by far in the minority.</p>
<p class="indent">The powerplant of a propeller-driven plane is usually considered to include both the engine and the propeller. The primary function of the engine is to turn the propeller, but it also generates electrical power, provides a vacuum source for some flight instruments, and provides a heat source for the pilot and passengers in most small single-engine planes.</p>
<p class="indent">Propeller-driven airplanes may have either a <span class="italic">fixed-pitch</span> or <span class="italic">variable-pitch</span> propeller. A fixed-pitch propeller’s pitch has a blade angle that can’t be changed by the pilot. The propeller is connected directly to the engine’s crankshaft; engine power rotates the crankshaft as well as the propeller, and the propeller converts the engine’s rotary power into thrust. A variable-pitch propeller, also known as a <span class="italic">constant-speed</span> propeller, is more efficient than its fixed-pitch counterpart because the pilot can adjust the blade angle for the most efficient operation.</p>
<p class="indent">Single-engine propeller-driven airplanes usually have the engine attached to the front of the fuselage, covered by a cowling to streamline the airflow around the engine; it also helps cool the engine by ducting air around the cylinders. Multi-engine planes, whether propeller driven or jet, usually have the engines mounted under the wings in a nacelle, which surrounds the entire engine and performs the same functions as a cowling. Some jet engines are attached to the empennage, but these are in the minority.</p>
<p class="indent">Jet engines work by forcing incoming air into a tube or cylinder where the air is compressed, mixed with fuel, burned, and pushed exhausted at high speed to generate thrust. There are several variations of jet engines, including the turbojet, turbofan, and ramjet. These engines all operate by the same basic principles, but each has its own distinct advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p class="indent">The critical part of a jet engine’s operation is compressing the incoming air. Most jets employ a section of compressors, consisting of rotating blades that slow the incoming air to create high pressure. This compressed air is then forced into a combustion section, where it is mixed with fuel and burned. As the high-pressure gases are exhausted, they are passed through a turbine section with more rotating blades. In this region, the exhaust gases turn the turbine blades, which are connected by a shaft to the compressor blades at the front of the engine&mdash;which means that the exhaust turns the turbines that turn the compressors to bring in more air and keep the engine going. The combustion gases then continue to expand out through the nozzle, “pushing” backward to create a forward thrust.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.7</span> Turbojet engine cross section</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Turbojets and turbofans can also be fitted with an <span class="italic">afterburner</span>. An afterburner is a tube placed between the turbine and the rear exhaust nozzle where additional fuel is added to the flow and ignited to provide increased thrust. However, afterburners greatly increase fuel consumption, so they can be used only for short periods.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Tail Assembly/Empennage</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The technical name for the tail section of an airplane is the <span class="italic">empennage</span>; this includes the entire tail section, which consists of both fixed and movable control surfaces. The fixed surfaces are the vertical and horizontal stabilizers, and the movable surfaces include the elevators, the rudder, and any trim tabs.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.8</span> Conventional empennage</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The elevators are movable control surfaces attached to the back or trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizers; they are used to move the nose of the airplane up or down during flight. Usually the two stabilizers are split, even at the back edge, by either the vertical stabilizer, the back end of the fuselage, or both; however, there are a few airplane designs where the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer is not split, and therefore there is only one elevator instead of two. For purposes of our discussion, however, we will consider the left and right horizontal stabilizers&mdash;and hence the attached elevators&mdash;to be split.</p>
<p class="indent">The rudder is a movable control surface attached to the back of the vertical stabilizer that is used to move the airplane’s nose left and right during flight. The rudder is used in <a id="calibre_link-2979" class="calibre3"></a>combination with the ailerons for turns while the airplane is flying. Some people incorrectly refer to the vertical stabilizer as the rudder, but now you know better.</p>
<p class="indent">Trim tabs are small movable segments of the trailing edge of the rudder, elevator(s), and ailerons. Controlled by the pilot in the cockpit, they reduce control pressures and decrease the pilot’s workload.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2431" href="#calibre_link-2533" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">NEWTON’S LAWS</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">British mathematician and philosopher Sir Isaac Newton put forth three basic laws of motion in the mid-1600s. Although we can be pretty confident that he wasn’t thinking of aircraft flight characteristics when he proposed these laws, virtually everything that an aircraft does has something to do with one or more of his three laws of motion.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Newton’s First Law of Motion (or Inertia)</span>, stated simply, maintains that a body at rest tends to remain at rest, and a body in motion tends to remain in motion (at the same speed and in the same direction) unless acted upon by an outside force. Stated differently, nothing in nature starts or stops moving until some outside force causes it to do so. This is connected with the concept of <span class="italic">inertia</span>, which is the property by which an object resists being accelerated in some different way from its current state.</p>
<p class="indent">Examples are the soccer ball that remains motionless (relative to Earth, anyway) on the ground until it is kicked, and the same soccer ball that keeps rolling until friction with the ground and the air around it slow it down and finally stop it. Likewise, an airplane parked on the ramp will stay there until enough force to move it is applied by its engines, a tow vehicle, a tornado, or something else.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Newton’s Second Law of Motion</span> is represented by the equation F = <span class="italic">ma</span>, where F is the <span class="italic">force</span> acting on an object, <span class="italic">m</span> stands for an object’s <span class="italic">mass</span>, and <span class="italic">a</span> is the object’s acceleration. According to this law, when an object is acted upon by a force, its resulting acceleration is directly proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. This means that force must be applied to overcome the inertia of an object: The greater the mass of the object, the greater the force needed to produce a particular acceleration.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="bold">Newton’s Third Law of Motion</span> is usually summarized like this: “For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.” Stated differently, when one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object. This law is most clearly demonstrated in the aerospace world by the operation of jets and rockets: As hot gases are pushed out the back, they exert a forward push on the object from which they escape (such as the jet engine connected to the aircraft).</p>
<p class="indentt">These laws need to be considered in the context of another of Newton’s laws, that of <span class="italic">universal gravitation</span>. This law says that two objects attract each other with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses (i.e., their masses multiplied together), and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This attraction is commonly known as <span class="italic">gravity</span>. Gravity accounts for the weight of an object on Earth (or some other planet, for that matter), and usually measures the pull of the large body (Earth, in this case) in pounds or kilograms.</p>
<p class="indent">It needs to be noted here that, although <span class="italic">mass</span> and <span class="italic">weight</span> are both commonly referred to in pounds or kilograms, <span class="italic">mass</span> is a constant that is unaffected by local gravitational conditions, whereas <span class="italic">weight</span> is a function of the planet’s gravity at that point. In other words, regardless of <a id="calibre_link-2980" class="calibre3"></a>the fact that an object can weigh six pounds on Earth, one pound on the moon (where gravity is one-sixth of that on Earth), or nothing at all in far outer space, its mass remains the same regardless&mdash;it will take the same amount of force in any of those places to accelerate it the same amount.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2432" href="#calibre_link-2534" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">FLIGHT THEORY AND THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Four forces act upon an aircraft in flight: <span class="italic">lift</span>, <span class="italic">gravity</span> (or weight), <span class="italic">thrust</span>, and <span class="italic">drag</span>. Lift pushes the aircraft up (i.e., away from Earth’s surface); weight pulls the aircraft down toward Earth (or, more precisely, toward Earth’s center); thrust pushes the aircraft forward; and drag tends to slow the aircraft, pushing back on it as it moves forward.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">flight envelope</span> consists of the different combinations of these factors and others that allow the aircraft to be flown safely. “Flying outside the envelope” is slang for some unsafe condition that caused problems in maintaining stability or even the ability to fly at all.</p>
<p class="indent">As mentioned earlier, the popular explanation of how an airfoil or wing generates lift is that the airfoil uses the aerodynamic forces identified by Bernoulli’s Principle to provide <span class="italic">lift</span> to the wings and therefore the aircraft. Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician, expanded on Newton’s theories about the motion of fluids in his <span class="italic">Hydrodynamics</span>, published in 1783. Bernoulli’s Principle says that as the velocity of a fluid increases, the pressure exerted by that fluid decreases. You can think of it that the faster a fluid (and air is a fluid) travels over a surface, the less time it has to exert pressure on any given part of that surface.</p>
<p class="indent">The popular explanation maintains that, because the top surface of the wing has more camber (curvature) than the bottom surface, the air flows faster over the top of the wing than it does underneath; this is because aerodynamic forces won’t allow the air flowing over the upper surface to “lag behind,” since that would create a vacuum at the trailing edge (and nature is very reluctant to allow vacuums to form). This faster airflow over the upper wing surface means that there is less air pressure above the wing than there is underneath; this difference in air pressure causes lift.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.9</span> Popular explanation of lift produced by an airfoil</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2981" class="calibre3"></a>Some may wonder why the air goes faster over the top of the wing and what compels the same batch of air to join up with the air it was split from by the leading edge of the airfoil. This is where the popular explanation starts to wobble.</p>
<p class="indent">There is an alternative explanation for how a wing provides lift that relies on Newton’s Laws of Motion instead of Bernoulli’s Principle. The popular explanation assumes that the transit time for air split by the wing’s leading edge is equal both under and over the wing, which is not borne out by wind tunnel testing. It also means that the popular explanation using Bernoulli’s Principle has a hard time explaining inverted flight, symmetric wings, and changes in wing load in a steep turn or when pulling out of a dive.</p>
<p class="indent">Newton’s Laws tell us that the wing must change something in the air around it (action) to get a reaction (lift). <a href="#calibre_link-2535" class="calibre3">Figure 7.9</a> shows the airflow around a wing as it is often represented. Notice that as the air is approached by the wing, it splits and reforms behind the wing, going in whatever direction it was going in before (or standing still). <span class="italic">This wing has no lift</span>. There is no net <span class="italic">action</span> on the air, and therefore no <span class="italic">reaction</span> of lift on the wing. If the wing has no net effect on the air, the air can’t have any net effect on the wing.</p>
<p class="indent">The alternative explanation proposes that, in order to generate lift, a wing must do something to the air. The wing splits the air (action), and lift is the reaction (see Newton’s Third Law). By this explanation, lift is the result of upwash and downwash caused by the wing’s movement through the air (see <a href="#calibre_link-2536" class="calibre3">Figure 7.10</a>). In this diagram, the air splits around the wing and leaves it at a slight downward angle. This downward-traveling air is the <span class="italic">downwash</span>, the action that creates lift as its reaction. In this figure, there has been a net change in the air after it passes over the wing&mdash;there is a force acting on the air and a reaction force acting on the wing. <span class="italic">This wing has lift.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The summary here is that a wing produces lift by diverting air downward. This should be as easy to understand as saying that a propeller produces thrust by pushing air backward. Or, for another example: Who hasn’t stuck their hand out of a moving car window and felt the force of the passing air push their hand upward (especially if you tilt the leading edge up a little bit, which diverts more air downward)? This is lift.</p>

<p class="box_noindent"><a id="calibre_link-2982" class="calibre3"></a><span class="gotham-medium1"><span class="bold">WARNING:</span> The flight aptitude test you take may refer to Bernoulli’s Principle as the cause of lift for an airfoil or wing. If this is the case, don’t fight City Hall! Once you pass the test, make it through training, and get your wings, you can publicize the more accurate Newtonian explanation of what causes lift. Maybe you will be the one who gets this incorrect explanation updated after you get your wings. Regardless, now you are armed with both the popular explanation and what really happens.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">A <span class="italic">stall</span> is caused by the separation of airflow from the wing’s upper surface, resulting in a rapid decrease in lift&mdash;possibly to the extent of falling out of the sky. This separation happens from the trailing edge moving forward toward the leading edge, and allows a reverse airflow to creep in that presses down on the wing. A stall usually occurs gradually, and the first indications may be provided by a mushiness in the controls or a slight buffeting of the aircraft; stall warning devices that detect the airflow separation may also provide notice. To recover from a stall or imminent stall, the pilot must restore the smooth airflow by decreasing the angle of attack below the stalling angle, allowing normal lift dynamics to resume.</p>
<p class="indent">Weight is the force produced by the mass of the airplane interacting with Earth’s gravitational field; it is the force that must be counteracted by lift to maintain flight.</p>
<div class="gbox">

</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Profile drag</span> or <span class="italic">parasitic drag</span> is experienced by all objects in an airflow, and is caused by resistance to the airplane pushing the air out of the way as it moves forward. This can be experienced by putting your hand out the window of a moving vehicle and then raising one finger out of alignment with the others.</p>
<p class="indent">The other type of drag is <span class="italic">induced drag</span>, which is the result of the production of lift. It is the part of the force produced by the wing that is parallel to the relative wind. Objects that create lift must also overcome this induced drag, also known as <span class="italic">drag-due-to-lift</span>.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Axes of Flight</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Whenever an airplane changes its position in flight (<span class="italic">flight attitude</span>), we talk about movement around one or more of three <span class="italic">axes</span>&mdash;imaginary lines running through the airplane’s center of gravity. The axes of an airplane can be thought of as imaginary axles around which the airplane turns, in the same way that a wheel rotates around an axle. At the point where all three axes intersect, each is at a 90-degree angle (a right angle) to the other two. The axis that <a id="calibre_link-2983" class="calibre3"></a>runs lengthwise through the fuselage from the nose to the tail is called the <span class="italic">longitudinal axis</span>. The axis that runs from wingtip to wingtip is called the <span class="italic">lateral axis</span>. The axis that passes vertically through the aircraft’s center of gravity is called the <span class="italic">vertical axis</span> (see <a href="#calibre_link-2537" class="calibre3">Figure 7.11</a>).</p>
<div class="keep">

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.11</span> The three axes of flight</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The airplane’s motion around its longitudinal axis resembles the roll of a ship from side to side. In fact, the names used in describing movement around the airplane’s three axes were originally nautical terms. Movement around the airplane’s longitudinal axis is called <span class="italic">roll</span>; movement around its lateral axis is referred to as <span class="italic">pitch</span>; and movement around the vertical axis is known as <span class="italic">yaw</span>&mdash;a horizontal (left and right) movement of the airplane’s nose. These three motions of the airplane are controlled by three control surfaces: roll is controlled by the ailerons; pitch is controlled by the elevators; and yaw is controlled by the rudder.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">The Atmosphere</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Our atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and one percent other gaseous elements, such as argon and helium. The heavier of these elements exhibit a natural tendency to remain closer to the surface of Earth, and the lighter elements are in the higher regions of the atmosphere. This explains why the vast majority of the atmosphere’s oxygen, as one of the relatively heavier elements, is found less than 35,000 feet from the surface.</p>
<p class="indent">The atmosphere&mdash;the air surrounding Earth&mdash;has mass and weight. For instance, the weight of the atmosphere at sea level results in an average pressure of 14.7 pounds on each square inch of an object’s surface. At 18,000 feet, however, the weight of the atmosphere is only about half of what it is at sea level.</p>
<p class="indent">Temperature, air pressure (depending in large part on altitude), and humidity play parts in an airplane’s performance, largely by affecting the amount of lift produced by the airfoils. Warmer air, for instance, is less dense than cooler air and therefore produces less lift.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Flight Controls</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A flight control system has two ends: the end where the pilot makes a change to a control in the cockpit, and the end where something on the outside of the aircraft changes and affects the airplane’s performance (faster, slower, up, down, left, right, etc.). Implied in this are the mechanical, hydraulic, electronic, and other means of connecting these two ends&mdash;of having the expected result occur reliably from a certain movement of the cockpit controls.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two types of flight control systems, <span class="italic">primary</span> and <span class="italic">secondary</span>. The primary control systems are those needed to safely control an airplane during flight, including the ailerons, elevator/stabilator, and rudder. Secondary control systems, such as wing flaps and trim control systems, improve the airplane’s performance or relieve the pilot from having to wrestle with excessive control forces.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2984" class="calibre3"></a>In the cockpit, the pilot has three main ways to control the aircraft while in flight: the joystick or control wheel, the rudder pedals, and the throttle(s) for the engine(s).</p>
<p class="indent">The joystick controls <span class="italic">roll</span> (movement around the longitudinal axis, one wing up and one wing down) and <span class="italic">pitch</span> (movement around the lateral axis, nose up or nose down). Some airplanes (usually larger ones) have a movable control column with a control wheel mounted near the top; the functions are the same. Move the stick or wheel to the left, and the left wing goes down while the right one comes up. Push forward on the joystick or control column and the nose of the airplane moves downward; pull back toward you and the nose will rise.</p>
<p class="indent">The two rudder pedals control the <span class="italic">yaw</span> of the airplane, which is how much (or how little) the nose points to the left or right in a horizontal sense, relative to the desired direction of travel.</p>
<p class="indent">The engine throttles are considered flight controls because they are the main way for the pilot to regulate how much thrust the engine is producing. This is important because the pilot has to use all these controls in coordination to safely control the airplane; having the airplane at the proper attitude to climb higher, for example, does no good if the engine isn’t producing enough thrust to accomplish the climb.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Primary Flight Controls</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Airplane control systems are designed to provide the pilot a natural “feel”&mdash;one where the amount of force the pilot uses, as well as the resistance and other feedback felt by the pilot through the controls, are proportionate to the amount of actual movement by the control surfaces&mdash;but at the same time remain adequately responsive to the pilot’s inputs on the controls. At low airspeeds, the controls usually feel soft and sluggish, and the airplane responds slowly to the controls. At higher speeds, the controls feel firmer and the response is quicker.</p>
<p class="indent">Moving one or more of the three primary flight control surfaces changes the airflow and pressure distribution over and around the airfoil (wings). These changes affect the lift and drag produced by the airfoil/control surface combination, which allows a pilot to control the airplane around its three axes of rotation.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01547.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre25" /></p>
<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-2985" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">AILERONS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Ailerons control the airplane’s movement around the longitudinal axis, also known as <span class="italic">roll</span>. They are attached to the outboard (the end farthest from the fuselage) trailing edge of each wing and move in opposite directions from each other.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-2986"><img src="images/01592.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.12</span> Ailerons</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Moving the joystick or control wheel to the right causes the right aileron to move or <span class="italic">deflect</span> upward while the left aileron moves downward. The upward deflection of the right aileron decreases the camber of that wing, causing a decrease in lift that makes the right wing drop. The same aerodynamics in reverse on the left cause that wing to rise because of increased lift. The combined effects cause the airplane to roll to the right.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">RUDDER</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The rudder controls the airplane’s movement around its vertical axis, called <span class="italic">yaw</span>. Like the other primary control surfaces, the rudder is a movable surface hinged to a fixed surface&mdash;in this case, to the vertical stabilizer. Moving the left or right rudder pedal causes the rudder to move in the same direction as the depressed pedal, and to the same relative extent. When the rudder is deflected into the airflow, the airflow exerts a horizontal force in the opposite direction.</p>
<div class="keep">

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.13</span> Rudder</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-2988" class="calibre3"></a>By pushing the left pedal, the rudder moves left. This alters the airflow around the vertical stabilizer and rudder, creating a sideward force that moves the tail to the right and yaws the nose of the airplane to the left. Rudder effectiveness increases with speed, so large deflections at low speeds and small deflections at high speeds are usually what’s required. In propeller-driven aircraft, any slipstream (rearward-flowing air pushed back by the propeller) flowing over the rudder increases its effectiveness.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">ELEVATOR</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The elevator is a hinged control surface attached to the rear of the horizontal stabilizer. On most planes, the elevators are divided by the vertical stabilizer and rudder; however, on some designs, the elevators are far enough back so that they are not two separated surfaces but one, called a <span class="italic">stabilator</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The elevator controls the airplane’s movement around its lateral axis, called <span class="italic">pitch</span>. Moving the joystick or control column to the rear (toward the pilot) causes the elevators to move or <span class="italic">deflect</span> air upward. The up-elevator position decreases the camber of the horizontal tail surface, creating a downward aerodynamic force greater than the slight tail-down force normal in most designs during straight and level flight. The overall effect causes the tail to move downward and the nose to pitch up, rotating around the plane’s center of gravity (CG). Moving the joystick or control column forward, of course, has the opposite effect.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-2989"><img src="images/01682.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.14</span> Elevator</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">All correctly executed turns are coordinated combinations of the use of ailerons, rudder, and elevators. Applying aileron pressure on the stick left or right is needed to achieve the desired bank angle, while the pilot simultaneously applies pressure on the rudder pedal to counteract adverse yaw.</p>
<p class="indent">Control surfaces are seldom used in isolation, because aerodynamic forces seldom work in only one direction. When left or right stick is applied, causing an aileron deflection that raises one wing, the downward-deflected aileron not only produces more lift, but also produces more drag. This drag causes the nose to yaw in the direction of the raised wing, called <span class="italic">adverse yaw</span>. Rudder movement in the opposite direction of the bank is used to compensate for adverse yaw. Likewise, during a turn, the angle of attack (the angle between the horizontal and the chord line of the airfoil) must be increased by applying elevator pressure because more lift is required than during straight and level flight. The steeper the turn, the more back elevator pressure is needed.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-2990" class="calibre5"></a><span class="bold1">Secondary Flight Controls</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Secondary flight control systems may consist of flaps, leading edge devices, spoilers, and trim systems.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">FLAPS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Flaps are the most common high-lift devices. These surfaces, which are attached to the trailing edge of the wing, increase both lift and drag for any given angle of attack. Flaps allow a compromise between high cruising speed and low landing speed because they may be extended when needed and then retracted into the wing’s structure when not needed.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">LEADING EDGE DEVICES</span></p>
<p class="noindent">High-lift devices can also be put on the leading edge of the airfoil. The most common types are fixed slats, movable slats, and leading edge flaps.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">SPOILERS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">On some airplanes, high-drag devices called spoilers are deployed from the wings to spoil the smooth airflow, reducing lift and increasing drag. Spoilers are used for roll control on some aircraft, one of the advantages being the elimination of adverse yaw. To turn right, for example, the spoiler on the right wing is raised, destroying some of the lift and creating more drag on the right. The right wing drops, and the airplane banks and yaws to the right. Deploying spoilers on both wings at the same time allows the aircraft to descend without gaining speed. Spoilers are also deployed to help shorten the ground roll after landing&mdash;by destroying lift, they transfer weight to the wheels, improving braking effectiveness.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">TRIM SYSTEMS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Trim systems are used to relieve the pilot of the need to maintain constant pressure on the flight controls&mdash;just think how tired you would get if you had to hold the steering wheel a quarter turn to the right just to go <span class="italic">straight</span> down the highway. Trim systems usually consist of small hinged devices attached to the trailing edge of one or more of the primary flight control surfaces. They help minimize a pilot’s workload by aerodynamically assisting movement and positioning of the flight control surface to which they are attached.</p>
<p class="indent">The most common trim system on small airplanes is a single trim tab attached to the trailing edge of the elevator, usually manually operated by a small control wheel or a crank. The cockpit control includes a tab position indicator; placing the trim control in nose-down position moves the tab to its full “up” position. With the tab up and into the airstream, the airflow over the horizontal tail surface forces the trailing edge of the elevator down. This causes the tail of the airplane to move up, and results in a nose-down pitch change.</p>
<p class="indent">In spite of the opposite direction movement of the trim tab and the elevator, trim control is natural to a pilot. If you have to exert constant back pressure on the control column, the need for nose-up trim is indicated. The normal trim procedure is to continue trimming until the airplane is balanced and the nose-heavy or tail-heavy condition is no longer apparent. Pilots normally establish the desired power, pitch, attitude, and configuration first, and then trim the airplane to relieve control pressures that may exist for that flight condition. Any time <a id="calibre_link-2991" class="calibre3"></a>power, pitch, attitude, or configuration are changed, retrimming will normally be necessary to relieve the control pressures for the new flight condition.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Flight Instruments</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Flight instruments enable a pilot to operate an airplane with optimal performance and increased safety, especially when flying long distances or in inclement weather conditions.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">ALTIMETER</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The altimeter measures height above a particular air pressure level, and therefore gives the pilot information about his altitude above the ground. Air is denser at sea level than at higher altitudes, so as altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. The pressure altimeter is an anaeroid barometer that measures atmospheric pressure at the level where the altimeter is located, and presents an altitude in feet. Different altimeters can vary considerably, though, in how they show altitude; some have one pointer, whereas others have two or more. The dial of a typical altimeter is graduated, with numerals arranged clockwise from 0 to 9. The shortest hand indicates altitude in tens of thousands of feet, the intermediate hand in thousands of feet, and the longest hand in hundreds of feet.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.15</span> Altimeter</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This indicated altitude is precisely correct, though, only when the sea level barometric pressure is at what has been determined to be the “standard” (29.92 inches of mercury), the sea level free air temperature is “standard” (+15°C or 59°F), and the pressure and temperature decrease at a standard rate with an increase in altitude. Adjustments for nonstandard conditions are performed by setting the corrected pressure into a barometric scale on the face of the altimeter; only after this corrected setting is in place does the altimeter indicate the precise altitude.</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-2993" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">TYPES OF ALTITUDE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Altitude is vertical distance above some point or level used as a reference. There are as many kinds of altitude as there are reference levels from which altitude is measured, and each may be used for specific reasons. Pilots are mainly concerned with five types of altitude:</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="gotham-medium">INDICATED ALTITUDE</span>&mdash;The uncorrected altitude read directly from the altimeter when it is set to the current altimeter setting.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="gotham-medium">TRUE ALTITUDE</span>&mdash;The vertical distance of the airplane above sea level; the actual altitude. It is often expressed as feet above mean sea level (MSL); airport, terrain, and obstacle elevations on aeronautical charts are true altitudes.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="gotham-medium">ABSOLUTE ALTITUDE</span>&mdash;The vertical distance of an airplane above the terrain, or above ground level.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="gotham-medium">PRESSURE ALTITUDE</span>&mdash;The altitude indicated when the altimeter setting window (barometric scale) is adjusted to 29.92. This is the altitude above the standard datum plane, which is a theoretical level where air pressure (corrected to 15°C) equals 29.92 inches of mercury (Hg). Pressure altitude is used to compute density altitude, true altitude, true airspeed, and other performance data.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="gotham-medium">DENSITY ALTITUDE</span>&mdash;This altitude is pressure altitude corrected for variations from standard temperature. When conditions are standard, pressure altitude and density altitude are the same. If the temperature is above standard, the density altitude is higher than pressure altitude. If the temperature is below standard, the density altitude is lower than pressure altitude. This is an important altitude because it is directly related to the airplane’s performance.</p>
<p class="indentt">As an example, consider an airport with a field elevation of 5,048 feet MSL where the standard temperature is 5°C. Under these conditions, pressure altitude and density altitude are the same&mdash;5,048 feet. If the temperature changes to 30°C, the density altitude increases to 7,855 feet. This means an airplane would perform on takeoff as though the field elevation were 7,855 feet at standard temperature. Conversely, a temperature of &ndash;25°C would result in a density altitude of 1,232 feet. An airplane would have much better performance under these conditions because the denser air would produce more lift.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Hypoxia</span> is a condition caused by insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream (in this context usually caused by unpressurized flight at too high an altitude). Symptoms are impaired reaction, confused thinking, poor judgment, fatigue, headaches, and sometimes euphoria; a prolonged condition can cause loss of consciousness and eventually death. A person with hypoxia may also show bluish lips and fingernail beds. This is generally not an issue below 10,000 feet altitude above mean sea level (MSL), although some people do not experience problems until higher elevations, and mountain climbers may be able to acclimatize themselves to much higher altitudes over time. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations only require oxygen for flights above 12,500 feet, but the rule of thumb for military flight operations above 10,000 feet is to use oxygen.</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-2994" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The vertical speed indicator (VSI), sometimes called a vertical velocity indicator, indicates whether the airplane is climbing, descending, or in level flight. The rate of climb or descent is indicated in feet per minute. If properly calibrated, the VSI indicates zero in level flight. The vertical speed indicator is capable of displaying two different types of information:</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> trend information that shows an immediate indication of an increase or decrease in the airplane’s rate of climb or descent</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> rate information that shows a stabilized rate of change in altitude</p>

<p class="indent">For example, if the airplane is maintaining a steady 500-foot-per-minute (fpm) climb and the nose is lowered slightly, the VSI immediately senses this change and indicates a decrease in the rate of climb. This first indication is called the <span class="italic">trend</span>. After a short time, the VSI needle stabilizes on the new rate of climb, which in this example is something less than 500 fpm. The time from the initial change in the rate of climb until the VSI displays an accurate indication of the new rate is called the <span class="italic">lag</span>. Some airplanes are equipped with an instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI), which incorporates accelerometers to compensate for the lag in the typical VSI.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">AIRSPEED INDICATOR</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The airspeed indicator is a sensitive differential pressure gauge that measures and promptly shows the difference between <span class="italic">pitot</span> (impact) pressure and static pressure, the undisturbed atmospheric pressure at level flight. These two pressures will be equal when the airplane is parked on the ground in calm air. When the airplane moves through the air, the pressure on the pitot line becomes greater than the pressure in the static lines. This difference in pressure is registered by the airspeed pointer on the face of the instrument, which is calibrated in miles per hour, knots, or both.</p>

<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-2998" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">TURN INDICATORS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Airplanes use two types of turn indicators&mdash;the <span class="italic">turn-and-slip indicator</span> and the <span class="italic">turn coordinator</span>. Because of the way the gyro is mounted, the turn-and-slip indicator shows only the rate of turn in degrees per second. Because the gyro on the turn coordinator is set at an angle (canted), it initially also shows roll rate. Once the roll stabilizes, it indicates the rate of turn. Both instruments indicate turn direction and coordination, and also serve as a backup source of bank information in the event an attitude indicator fails. Coordination is achieved by referring to the <span class="italic">inclinometer</span>, which consists of a liquid-filled curved tube with a ball inside.</p>
<p class="indent">The inclinometer shows airplane yaw, the side-to-side movement of the airplane’s nose. During coordinated, straight and level flight, gravity causes the ball to rest in the lowest part of the tube, centered between the reference lines. Coordinated flight is maintained by keeping the ball centered. If the ball is not centered, it can be centered by using the rudder. To do this, apply rudder pressure on the side where the ball is deflected. Use the simple rule of “step on the ball” to remember which rudder pedal to press.</p>

<p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">artificial horizon</span> (also called the <span class="italic">attitude indicator</span>), with its miniature airplane and horizon bar, displays a picture of the attitude of the airplane. The relationship of the miniature airplane to the horizon bar is the same as the relationship of the real airplane to the actual horizon. The instrument gives an instantaneous indication of even the smallest changes in attitude.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.19</span> Artificial horizon</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The gyro in the attitude indicator is mounted rigidly on a horizontal plane. The horizon bar represents the true horizon and is connected to the gyro, remaining in the horizontal plane as the airplane pitches or banks around its lateral or longitudinal axis, indicating the attitude of the airplane relative to the true horizon.</p>
<p class="indent">The pilot can use an adjustment knob to move the miniature airplane up or down to align it with the horizon bar as the pilot sees it from his position. Normally, the miniature airplane is adjusted so that the wings overlap the horizon bar when the airplane is in straight and level cruising flight.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3001" class="calibre3"></a>The attitude indicator is reliable and the most realistic flight instrument on the instrument panel. What it shows is a very close approximation of the actual attitude of the airplane.</p>
<p class="indent">Different aircraft have different styles of artificial horizon instrument faces, but you don’t need to be confused&mdash;the basics for all of them are the same. Although only the AFOQT actually has an Instrument Comprehension subtest using this instrument (and a magnetic compass), understanding what an artificial horizon shows you is a fundamental skill for all the military flight aptitude tests.</p>
<p class="indent">There is differing feedback about which instrument face version is actually on the AFOQT, but all of them share common characteristics, including:</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> A representation of the aircraft’s wings that will remain horizontal relative to the instrument panel, representing the pilot’s perspective</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> A line stretching across the instrument that represents how the horizon will appear from the pilot’s perspective&mdash;this will move up or down depending on the attitude (climbing, level, or diving) of the aircraft, and it will tilt left or right depending on the bank (left, none/level, or right) of the aircraft at that moment</p>

<p class="noindent">The magnetic compass is usually the only direction-seeking instrument in the airplane. The compass card has letters for cardinal headings, and each 30-degree interval is represented by a number, the last zero of which is omitted. For example, 30° appears as a 3 and 300° appears as a 30. Between these numbers, the card is marked in 5-degree increments. The magnetic compass is required equipment in all airplanes.</p>

<p class="indent">Although Earth’s magnetic field lies <span class="italic">roughly</span> north and south, the magnetic poles don’t exactly coincide with the geographic poles (which are used in the compilation of aeronautical charts). Therefore, at most places on Earth’s surface, the direction-sensitive steel needles that seek Earth’s magnetic field will not point to true north, but instead to magnetic north. Furthermore, local magnetic fields from mineral deposits and other conditions may distort Earth’s magnetic field and cause additional errors.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">VERTICAL CARD COMPASS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The vertical card compass is a newer design that significantly reduces the inherent error of the older compass models. It consists of an azimuth on a rotating vertical card, and resembles a heading indicator with a fixed miniature airplane to accurately represent the airplane’s heading. The presentation is easy to read, and the pilot can see the complete 360° dial in relation to the airplane heading.</p>

Frequent magnetic compass errors make straight flight and precision turns to exact headings (directions) hard to accomplish, especially in turbulent air. A heading indicator, however, being mechanical, is not affected by the forces that make the magnetic compass difficult to interpret precisely.</p>

<p class="indent">Some heading indicators receive a magnetic north reference from a magnetic slaving transmitter, and generally need no adjustment. Heading indicators that don’t have this automatic north-seeking capability are called “free” gyros, and require periodic adjustment.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Basic Flight Maneuvers</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There are four fundamental flight maneuvers on which all flying tasks are based: straight and level flight, turns, climbs, and descents. All controlled flight consists of one or more of these basic maneuvers.</p>
<p class="indent">Straight and level flight is flight where the pilot maintains a constant heading and altitude. It is accomplished by making immediate, measured corrections for deviations in direction and altitude from unintentional slight turns, descents, and climbs.</p>
<p class="indent">An aircraft turns by banking the wings in the direction of the desired turn. The pilot chooses a specific bank angle and applies control pressure on the stick or control wheel to achieve it. Once the bank angle is established, the pilot continues to exert the pressure to maintain the desired angle.</p>
<p class="indent">All four primary controls are used in close coordination when making turns:</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> The ailerons bank the wings and so determine the rate of turn at any given airspeed.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> The elevator moves the nose of the airplane up or down in relation to the pilot, and perpendicular to the wings. In doing so, it both sets the pitch attitude in the turn and “pulls” the nose of the airplane around the turn.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> The throttle controls the engine, which provides thrust that may be used for airspeed to tighten the turn.</p>
<p class="bl"><a id="calibre_link-3007" class="calibre3"></a><span class="tcn">■</span> The rudder offsets any yaw effects developed by the other controls. The rudder does not turn the airplane, as many people believe.</p>
<p class="indent">Turns are divided into three classes: shallow, medium, and steep.</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> Shallow turns are those in which the bank is so shallow (less than about 20°) that the inherent lateral stability of the airplane acts to level the wings unless some aileron is applied to maintain the bank.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Medium turns result from a degree of bank at which the airplane remains at a constant bank (approximately 20° to 45°).</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Steep turns result from a degree of bank (45° or more) at which the “over-banking tendency” of an airplane overcomes stability, and the bank increases unless aileron is applied to prevent it. Changing the direction of the wing’s lift toward one side or the other causes the airplane to be pulled in that direction. The pilot does this by applying coordinated aileron and rudder to bank the airplane in the direction of the desired turn.</p>
<p class="indent">When an airplane is flying straight and level, the total lift force is acting perpendicular both to the wings and Earth. As the airplane is banked into a turn, lift then becomes a result of two components. The <span class="italic">vertical</span> lift component continues to act perpendicular to Earth and opposes gravity. The <span class="italic">horizontal</span> lift component (centripetal force) acts parallel to Earth’s surface and opposes inertia (apparent centrifugal force). These two lift components act at right angles to each other, causing the resultant total lift force to act perpendicular to the banked wing of the airplane. It is the horizontal lift component that actually turns the airplane, not the rudder.</p>
<p class="indent">As the pilot applies aileron to bank the airplane, the lowered aileron on the rising wing produces a greater drag than the raised aileron on the lowered wing. This increased aileron yaws the airplane toward the rising wing, or opposite to the direction of turn. To counteract this adverse yawing moment, the pilot must apply rudder pressure simultaneously with aileron in the desired direction to produce a coordinated turn.</p>

<p class="h2"><span class="bold">CLIMBS AND CLIMBING TURNS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When an airplane enters a climb, it changes its flight path from level flight to an inclined plane or <span class="italic">climb attitude</span>. In a climb, weight no longer acts in a direction perpendicular to the flight path, but instead in a rearward direction. This causes an increase in total drag, requiring an increase in thrust (power) to balance the forces. An airplane can sustain a climb angle only when there is sufficient thrust to offset increased drag; therefore, a climb is limited by the thrust available.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3009" class="calibre3"></a>A <span class="italic">normal climb</span> is performed at an airspeed recommended by the airplane manufacturer, and is generally somewhat higher than the airplane’s <span class="italic">best rate of climb</span>. The additional airspeed provides better engine cooling, easier control, and better visibility over the nose. Normal climb is sometimes referred to as <span class="italic">cruise climb.</span> Complex or high-performance airplanes may have a specified cruise climb in addition to normal climb.</p>
<p class="indent">An airplane’s <span class="italic">best rate of climb</span> (V<span class="sub1">y</span>) is performed at an airspeed where the most excess power is available over that required for level flight. This condition of climb will produce the most gain in altitude in the least amount of time (maximum rate of climb in feet per minute). The best rate of climb made at full allowable power is a maximum climb.</p>
<p class="indent">An airplane’s <span class="italic">best angle of climb</span> (V<span class="sub1">x</span>) is performed at an airspeed that will produce the most altitude gain in a given distance. Best angle-of-climb airspeed (V<span class="sub1">x</span>) is considerably lower than best rate of climb (V<span class="sub1">y</span>), and is the airspeed where the most excess thrust is available over that required for level flight. The best angle of climb will result in a steeper climb, although the airplane will take longer to reach the same altitude than it would at its best rate of climb. The best angle of climb, therefore, is used in such situations as clearing obstacles after takeoff.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">DESCENTS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When an airplane starts a descent, it changes its flight path from level to an inclined plane. There are three main categories of descents:</p>
<p class="indent">A <span class="italic">partial power descent</span> is the normal method of losing altitude, often called <span class="italic">cruise</span> or <span class="italic">enroute</span> descent. The airplane manufacturer normally recommends a setting of airspeed and power that will result in a target descent rate of 400&ndash;500 fpm. The airspeed may differ anywhere from cruise speed to that used on the downwind leg of the landing pattern. The pilot should keep the desired airspeed, pitch attitude, and power combination steady throughout the descent.</p>
<p class="indent">A descent at <span class="italic">minimum safe airspeed</span> (MSA) is a nose-high, power-assisted descent method mostly used for clearing obstacles during a landing approach to a short runway. The airspeed used for this type of approach is normally no more than 1.3 times the stall speed in the landing configuration (V<span class="sub1">S0</span>). The MSA approach is characterized by a steeper-than-normal descent angle, along with the excess power available that would be needed to produce acceleration at low airspeed if “mushing” and/or an excessive descent rate occur.</p>
<p class="indent">A <span class="italic">glide</span> is a basic maneuver where the airplane loses altitude in a controlled manner with little or no engine power involved. Forward motion is maintained by gravity pulling the airplane along its down-sloping inclined path; the descent is controlled as the pilot balances the forces of lift and gravity.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">POWER AND PITCH</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In addition to the dynamics already mentioned, the pilot must understand the effects of both power and elevator control as they work together during different flight conditions. Although there is a wide spectrum of combinations of conditions and settings, the overall rule of thumb for determining airspeed and altitude control runs something like this: <span class="italic">At any pitch attitude, the amount of power used will determine whether the airplane will climb, descend, or remain level at that altitude.</span></p>
<p class="indent">In the majority of nose-down situations, a descent is the only possible flight condition. If you add power under these circumstances, it will only result in a descent at a faster airspeed. However, through a range of attitudes from only slightly nose-down to about 30° nose-up, a <a id="calibre_link-3010" class="calibre3"></a>typical light aircraft can be made to climb, descend, or remain level based on the power used. In about the lower third of this range, the airplane will descend at idle power without stalling. As pitch attitude is increased, however, engine power is required to prevent a stall. Even more power will be required to maintain altitude, and yet more to climb. In a small plane, at a pitch attitude of about 30° nose-up, it will take all available power just to maintain altitude. A slight increase in the steepness of the climb, of a slight decrease in power, will result in a descent (whether the pilot intended it or not); again, this is known as “trying to fly outside the envelope.” At that point, the slightest inducement will then further result in a stall.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2433" href="#calibre_link-2541" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">ROTARY-WING AIRCRAFT</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">A helicopter creates lift in a unique way. It has a rotary “wing,” compared to the fixed, stationary wing on an airplane. Where a fixed-wing aircraft has to be moving to produce lift from airflow over the airfoil or wing, a helicopter achieves it by manipulating its rapidly rotating main rotor blades, changing the angle at which they meet the air and diverting it downward. Like a wing, the lift provided by a rotor blade is proportional to its angle of attack. Unlike a wing, the speed of any given spot on the rotor blade increases with its distance from where it is connected to the <span class="italic">rotor hub</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Helicopters in horizontal flight are subject to the same four forces as an airplane: lift, weight (or gravity), thrust, and drag. One difference, however, is that the thrust from a helicopter’s rotors can be applied vertically, as when it’s in a hover.</p>
<p class="indent">Just like a wing on an airplane, the lift on a wing or rotor blade is proportional to the amount of air diverted downward, multiplied by the vertical velocity of that air, so lift is proportional to the speed squared. That means that the lift of the rotor blade increases rapidly as the distance from the rotor hub increases.</p>
<p class="indent">The curved gray lines in <a href="#calibre_link-2542" class="calibre3">Figure 7.26</a> show the lift produced by a rotor in hover with a constant angle of attack all along the length of the blade. You can see that most of the lift is produced near the blade tips. To improve this, many rotor blades are made with a twist so that the angle of attack decreases as the distance from the rotor hub increases, giving the more uniform lift distribution shown by the black line.</p>
<div class="keep">

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.26</span> Lift distribution of rotor blades with and without a twist</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Because the rotor blades are long and thin in cross section, they are fairly flexible. As a result of this and the higher lift loading as the distance from the hub increases, the rotors form a cone as they spin, something like a very shallow inverted ice cream cone.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-3011"><a id="calibre_link-3012" class="calibre3"></a><img src="images/01113.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.27</span> Rotor tip-path plane</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The rotor <span class="italic">tip-path plane</span> is a disk formed by the rotor tips as the rotors spin, often called the <span class="italic">rotor disk</span>. The force produced by the rotors is perpendicular to this plane. When the tip-path plane is tilted, as shown in <a href="#calibre_link-2543" class="calibre3">Figure 7.28</a>, the force is also tilted, and it can be separated into two components. The vertical component is the lift, which overcomes the weight of the helicopter and can, if large enough, cause the helicopter to increase its altitude. The horizontal component of the force is the thrust, used for forward motion, turns, or to slow the helicopter down.</p>
<div class="keep">

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.28</span> Tilted tip-path plane and resulting thrust</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Besides lift and thrust, another result of the rotors’ motion around the hub is the helicopter fuselage’s tendency to rotate in the opposite direction from the rotor. The <span class="italic">tail rotor</span> uses some of the engine’s power to provide <span class="italic">torque control</span> by pushing or pulling (depending on the helicopter) the tail back the other way to maintain stability.</p>
<p class="indent">In stabilized horizontal flight, the force of lift equals weight and the force of thrust equals drag. The difference between hovering and horizontal flight is that, in horizontal flight, the thrust force and drag force are acting horizontally while the lift and weight act vertically. If thrust exceeds drag, then the helicopter increases its horizontal speed. If drag is greater than thrust, then the helicopter decreases its horizontal speed. If lift is greater than weight, then the helicopter climbs. If weight is greater than lift, the helicopter descends. And, because of the helicopter’s unique characteristics, horizontal flight is not limited to only the forward direction. This lift, weight, thrust, and drag relationship applies to any direction that the helicopter is moving (forward, sideways, or backward).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3013" class="calibre3"></a>Controlling a helicopter’s flight path and position is a little more complex than a fixed-wing aircraft. The pilot has three major flight controls: the <span class="italic">cyclic</span>, whereby the pilot controls longitudinal and lateral movement with a joystick to his front center; the <span class="italic">collective</span>, which controls pitch (by lifting or lowering the handle) as well as engine torque by means of a throttle that the pilot rotates around the collective handle; and the <span class="italic">directional control system</span>, where the pilot controls the tail rotor torque and how much or how little it is “pulling” or “pushing” the tail one way or the other. Let’s examine these controls in a little more detail.</p>
<p class="indent">(Note: Unlike some airplanes, helicopters are very sensitive to pilot inputs and are therefore very responsive. Another difference is that the pilot in command of a helicopter normally sits on the right, as opposed to an airplane’s pilot in command, who sits in the left-hand seat.)</p>
<p class="indent">The cyclic controls the direction of the tilt of the main rotor. While the helicopter rotors are spinning, if you move the stick forward, the main rotor will tilt forward. If you move the stick backward, the main rotor will tilt backward; move the cyclic to one side and it will tilt the main rotor disc to that side. This control changes the lift and thrust forces. The three axes of movement are still the same, and the terms used to describe movement around (or <span class="italic">about</span>, as it is sometimes called) any of these axes are the same as with fixed-wing craft.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.29</span> Primary helicopter cockpit controls</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The collective is a long tube mounted at an angle to the cockpit floor to the left of the pilot; it controls the angle of the main rotor blades. If you pull the collective up, the angle of the main rotor blades increases (the leading edge of the rotor blades will move higher than the trailing edge of the rotor blade). This control affects the lift and thrust forces also. Wrapped around the collective is a throttle control the pilot operates by turning around the tube of the collective.</p>
<p class="indent">The tail rotor pedals at the pilot’s feet control the pitch of the tail rotor blades and therefore how much the tail rotor pulls or pushes the tail of the aircraft.</p>
<p class="indent">To fly the helicopter, the pilot uses all of these controls in combination. By changing the lift and thrust of the main rotor with the cyclic and collective, the pilot can move the helicopter in any direction. Moving the cyclic forward moves the helicopter forward. Moving the cyclic to the left moves the helicopter to the left. Moving the cyclic to the left and forward moves the helicopter forward and to the left. Lifting the collective up causes the helicopter to climb. Lowering the collective causes the helicopter to descend. Moving the cyclic forward and lifting the collective causes the helicopter to increase its forward speed and may result in a climb, depending on how much the collective is raised. The pilot uses pressure from his <a id="calibre_link-3015" class="calibre3"></a>feet on the tail rotor pedals to control whether the nose yaws left or right; left pedal moves the nose to the left, and right pedal moves the nose to the right.</p>
<p class="indent">If you increase the collective and the engine increases power (some helicopters have automatic engine controls that do this for you) to keep the same RPMs to the main rotor, the torque force that’s trying to make the cabin spin around will also increase. This requires more left pedal (or pedal opposite to the direction that torque is trying to spin the helicopter) to keep the nose of the helicopter in the same place. So, an increase in collective needs to have an equal increase in pressure on the appropriate tail rotor pedal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Autorotation</span> is the action of turning a rotor system by airflow rather than engine power, which would be needed in, for instance, an engine failure situation. Airflow up through the rotor system during a power-off descent provides the energy to overcome blade drag and turn the rotor, slowing the descent of the helicopter to a manageable level.</p>
<p class="indent">The tail rotor is still important in an autorotation because the pilot needs to have some control over the yaw axis (left and right). During autorotation the tail rotor still turns because it is connected to the main rotor via a transmission; as long as the main rotor is turning (and the transmission is functioning properly), the tail rotor will be turning, too. Torque does not exist during an autorotation, but there is a little bit of drag/friction from the main rotors’ and tail rotors’ transmissions that causes the helicopter to turn in the direction of the main rotor spin. This is controlled by input from the pilot through the tail rotor.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Translational lift</span> is the additional lift the helicopter gets when it flies out from its own downwash, which has a cushioning effect as long as the helicopter is low enough.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Gyroscopic precession</span>, which applies to any spinning disc, means that a force applied to a spinning disc has its effect happen 90° later in the direction and plane of rotation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Coriolis force</span> (ice skater example): When an ice skater spins in a circle and her arms are out, they have a certain spin speed. If she pulls her arms in, the spin accelerates because the center of mass of the skater’s arms is closer to the axis of rotation. The same thing happens in a helicopter if you replace the skater’s arms with rotor blades.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">transverse flow effect</span> is when air flowing over the rear portion of the main rotor disc is accelerated downward by the main rotor, which causes the rear portion to have a smaller angle of attack. This results in less lift to the rear portion of the rotor disc, but, because of gyroscopic precession, the result is felt 90° later.</p>

<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2435" href="#calibre_link-2545" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">AIRPORT AND RUNWAY INFORMATION</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="italic">runway</span> is a strip of land on which aircraft can take off and land; it is part of the <span class="italic">maneuvering</span> or <span class="italic">movement area</span>, which also includes taxiways and other areas controlled by the air traffic control tower. Runway surfaces can be composed of a man-made material (usually asphalt, concrete, or a mixture) or natural ones, such as grass, dirt, or gravel.</p>
<p class="indent">Runways are named from 01&ndash;36 for a one-tenth value of their heading or direction, rounded to the nearest 10 degrees&mdash;so a runway pointing east (90°) would be “runway 09,” a runway pointing west (270°) would be “runway 27,” and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Runways in North America use true or <span class="italic">geographic north</span> (also known as <span class="italic">grid north</span>) instead of <span class="italic">magnetic north</span> because magnetic compass needles point toward the magnetic north pole, which is in the Arctic Ocean about a thousand miles south of the geographic north pole. The magnetic north pole also actually moves from 5 to 25 miles (9 to 41 km) per year because of currents in the magma far below Earth’s surface.</p>
<p class="indent">Since most runways can be used coming from or going to either direction, they can be considered to have two identities. “Runway 30” would be coming in from the southeast or taking off to the northwest with a heading of 300°, whereas the same runway would be referred to as “runway 12,” coming in from the northwest or taking off to the southeast. The numbers always differ by 18, indicating a difference of 180° or half of the compass.</p>
<p class="indent">Runway numbers are also spoken one by one to avoid confusion. In the examples above, these would be spoken of as “runway three zero” and “runway one two” instead of “runway thirty” or “runway twelve.”</p>
<p class="indent">If two or more runways are parallel, heading in the same direction (also known as <span class="italic">dua</span><span class="italic">l</span>), they are differentiated by adding “left,” “center,” or “right” to the number. For example, if two runways both run east/west, the northernmost runway when heading west (270°) would be runway 27R (spoken as “runway two seven right”) and the other, runway 09L (spoken as “runway zero nine left”), when heading east (90°). These numbers are marked on the end of the runway, called the <span class="italic">threshold</span>. Runways will also usually have other markings besides the end number; they will probably have white stripes down the middle and solid white lines at the edges. Larger runways will also usually have a band of white stripes across the threshold and other markings to indicate an aiming point for aircraft touchdown and distance to the end of the runway.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 7.30</span> Typical runway oriented east/west</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Fixed-wing aircraft usually try to take off and land into the wind to increase airflow over the wing and thereby increase lift, at the same time decreasing the ground speed needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Runways vary in size from general aviation airports as small as 800 ft. (244 m) long and 26 ft. (8 m) wide to international airports as large as 18,000 ft. (5,500 m) long and 260 ft. (80 m) wide. At sea level, a 10,000-ft. (3,000-m) runway can land virtually any aircraft. However, even an average size aircraft will need a longer runway at higher altitudes or in hotter, more humid conditions due to the decreased air density, which reduces lift and engine power.</p>
<p class="indent">A runway of at least 6,000&nbsp;ft. (1,800 m) in length is usually adequate for aircraft weighing less than about 200,000&nbsp;lbs. (90,000 kg). Larger aircraft usually require at least 8,000&nbsp;ft. <span class="normal"><br class="calibre2" />(2,400 m) at sea level and somewhat more at airports with higher altitudes. International “wide-body” flights, which carry substantial amounts of fuel and are therefore heavier, may also have landing requirements of up to 10,000&nbsp;</span>ft. (3,000 m) or more and takeoff requirements of up to 13,000&nbsp;ft. (4,000 m) or more.</p>
<p class="indent">Runway markings are white, and may be outlined in black for greater visibility and contrast. Heliport landing area markings are also white, except for hospital heliports, which use a red “H” on a white cross. Markings for taxiways, areas not intended for use by aircraft, and holding positions&mdash;even if they are on a runway&mdash;are yellow.</p>
<p class="indent">There are three types of runways: <span class="italic">visual</span>, <span class="italic">nonprecision instrument</span>, and <span class="italic">precision instrument</span>. Visual runways such as those at small airstrips usually have no markings, but they may have threshold markings, designators, and centerlines. They do not provide an instrument-based landing procedure&mdash;pilots must be able to see the runway to use it. Also, radio communication may not be available, so pilots must be self-reliant.</p>
<p class="indent">Nonprecision instrument runways are most often seen at small- to medium-size airports. Depending on the surface, these runways may be marked with threshold markings, designators, centerlines, and sometimes a 1,000-ft. (304.80-km) or 1,500-ft. (457.20-km) mark known as an <span class="italic">aiming point</span>. They provide horizontal position guidance to planes on instrument approach.</p>
<p class="indent">Precision instrument runways, seen at medium- and large-size airports, usually consist of a blast pad/stopway, threshold, designator, centerline, aiming point, and touchdown zone marks at 500-ft. intervals from 500 ft. (152 m) to 3,000 ft. (914 m). Precision runways provide pilots with both horizontal and vertical guidance for instrument approaches.</p>
<p class="indent">Airports that allow night landings use runway lighting to mark their runways, including some or all of the following, among others:</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> Approach Lighting System (ALS): a series of lightbars, strobe lights, or a combination of the two that extends outward from the approach end of the runway.</p>
<p class="bl"><a id="calibre_link-3021" class="calibre3"></a><span class="tcn">■</span> Runway End Identification Lights (REIL): a pair of synchronized flashing lights installed at the runway threshold, one on each side. They can face the approach direction or be omnidirectional (visible from all directions). They enhance identification of a runway surrounded by other lighting or lacking contrast with the surrounding terrain, as well as during reduced visibility.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Runway end lights: a pair of four lights on each side of precision instrument runways, extending the full width of the runway. These lights show green when viewed by approaching aircraft and red when seen from the runway to indicate the end of the runway to a departing aircraft.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Runway edge lights: white elevated lights running the length of the runway on both sides. On precision instrument runways, the edge lighting becomes yellow in the last 2,000&nbsp;ft. (610 m) or half the runway length, whichever is greater. Taxiways are differentiated by being bordered by omnidirectional blue lights, or by having green center lights, depending on the width of the taxiway and the complexity of the taxi pattern.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Runway Centerline Lighting System (RCLS): white lights embedded in the surface of the runway along the centerline at 50-ft. (15-m) intervals, changing to alternating red and white 3,000 ft. (915 m) from the end of the runway, and then to red for the last 1,000&nbsp;ft. (305 m).</p>
<p class="indent">Larger airports may also have a Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI), which is a system of lights that provides descent guidance information during an approach to a runway. The system uses red lights to indicate the upper glide path limits and white lights for lower limits. The VASI is visible for 3&ndash;5 miles during the day and up to 20 miles or more at night. The VASI’s visual glide path provides safe obstruction clearance within about 10 degrees of the extended runway centerline and to up to four nautical miles from the runway threshold.</p>
<p class="indent">Runway lights are usually operated by the airport or airfield control tower. Smaller airports may not have lighted runways or runway markings; there may be nothing more than a wind sock beside a landing strip, particularly at small private airfields for light planes.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2436" href="#calibre_link-2546" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">NAUTICAL INFORMATION</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The U.S. Navy was founded on October 13, 1775, and the Department of the Navy was established on April 30, 1798. The Department of the Navy has three principal components: the Navy Department, consisting of executive offices mostly in Washington, D.C.; the operating forces, including the Marine Corps, the reserve components, and, in wartime, the U.S. Coast Guard (a component of the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime); and the shore establishment.</p>
<p class="indent">The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps, two independent military services, comprise the Naval Services. The Navy has a traditional pyramidal structure; the management of money, personnel, and materiel in the Navy is no different than that of most large corporations.</p>
<p class="indent">The Navy’s operating forces are subordinate to the six multiservice (joint) Geographic Combatant Commands: Northern Command, Southern Command, European Command, Pacific Command, Central Command, and Africa Command.</p>
<p class="indent">The independent carrier battle group or strike group is usually considered the primary building block of projecting power or responding to a crisis. Operating in international waters, the carrier battle group does not need the permission of a host country for landing or overflight rights, nor does it need to build or maintain bases in countries where a U.S. presence may cause political or other strains. Aircraft carriers are sovereign U.S. territory that can <a id="calibre_link-3022" class="calibre3"></a>and do steam anywhere in international waters&mdash;and, it’s useful to note, most of the surface of the globe is water.</p>
<p class="indent">By using the oceans both as a means of access and as a base, forward-deployed Navy and Marine forces are readily available to provide the United States with a flexible range of national response capabilities. These capabilities range from “simply showing the flag”&mdash;just a presence to let people in the region know that the United States is interested in what’s going on&mdash;to insertion of forces ashore.</p>
<p class="indent">The typical air wing aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier usually contains three to four FA-18 squadrons, one EA-6B squadron, and one E-2C squadron. They also include a logistic support squadron, an antisubmarine warfare helicopter squadron, and an antisurface warfare helicopter squadron. Flight operations resemble a well-choreographed ballet. Those involved in the “evolution” (one specific but multi-role task, such as launching aircraft, landing aircraft, or refueling at sea) have specific, clearly defined roles, and are easily recognizable by the color of their jerseys.</p>

<p class="indent">The active duty Marine Corps is officially organized into three ground divisions and three aircraft wings, with a large combat support force formed into three service support groups. The Marine Corps Reserve consists of an additional ground division, aircraft wing, and support group. These divisions and wings can be considered the administrative structure for Marine units deployed in Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTFs). The MAGTF is the basic building block of Marine Corps operating forces, and is an integrated, combined-arms force made up of command, ground combat, aviation combat, and service support elements. Regardless of size&mdash;from relatively small, special purpose MAGTFs to multidivision-size Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs)&mdash;all MAGTFs are “expeditionary” forces, capable of carrying out specific missions. For example, MEFs comprising 40,000 or more troops are capable of amphibious assaults and sustained operations for up to 60 days without a resupply of ammunition, food, water, and other supplies.</p>
<p class="indent">Many nautical terms, phrases, and practices come from situations in the days when naval vessels were made of wood and propelled by the wind. By no means will all of these terms be tested on the Navy/Marine Corps/Coast Guard Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB-E); however, since test questions are closely guarded secrets and change from version to version and from time to time, it is wise for the examinee to be familiar with as much naval <a id="calibre_link-3023" class="calibre3"></a>terminology as possible to gain the best possible understanding of a test question. Therefore, this section provides not only definitions but in some cases historical context.</p>

<p class="year"><span class="cbold">ARRESTING CABLES</span>&mdash;Each carrier-based aircraft has a tailhook, a hook bolted to an 8-foot bar extending from the after part of the aircraft. It is with the tailhook that the pilot catches one of the four steel cables stretched across the deck at 20-foot intervals, bringing the plane, traveling at 150 miles per hour, to a complete stop in about 320 feet. The cables are set to stop each aircraft at the same place on the deck, regardless of the size or weight of the plane.</p>

<p class="year"><span class="cbold">BOARDING A SMALL BOAT OR ENTERING A CAR</span>&mdash;When boarding a small boat or entering a car, juniors enter first and take up the seats or the space beginning forward, leaving the most desirable seat for the senior. Seniors enter last and leave first.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">BOATSWAIN</span> or <span class="cbold">BOSUN</span>&mdash;the sailor or petty officer in charge of the deck force or a specific section of the ship’s crew.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">BOOT CAMP</span>&mdash;basic training given to new (recruit) sailors and Marines. During the Spanish-American War (1898&ndash;1902), sailors wore leggings called boots; this came to mean a Navy or Marine recruit.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">BOOT ENSIGN</span>&mdash;the most senior ensign of a Navy ship, squadron, or shore activity. In addition to his or her normal duties, the boot ensign teaches less-experienced ensigns about life <a id="calibre_link-3024" class="calibre3"></a>at sea, planning and coordinating wardroom social activities, making sure that the officers’ mess runs smoothly, and generally trying to make sure that the junior ensigns don’t embarrass themselves or the Navy. Even though the position usually has little official authority, the boot ensign can also serve as the focus of the unit’s expression of pride and spirit. Also called “bull ensign.”</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">BOW</span>&mdash;the front of the ship.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">BRAVO ZULU</span>&mdash;well done.</p>

On each plane’s nose gear is a T-bar that locks into the catapult shuttle, which pulls the plane down the catapult’s length. The flight deck crew can launch two aircraft and land one every 37 seconds in daylight, and one per minute at night.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">“COME LEFT/RIGHT TO COURSE”</span>&mdash;make a slight change in course or heading, usually less than 15 degrees.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">COURSE</span>&mdash;the ship’s direction or compass heading, expressed in degrees or, less frequently, in cardinal directions.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">COXSWAIN</span>&mdash;the helmsman of a ship. Originally the coxswain (pronounced “coxun”) was the swain (boy servant) in charge of the small cockboat kept aboard for the ship’s captain, which was used to row him to and from the ship. With time this has come to mean the helmsman of any boat or ship, regardless of size.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">DAVY JONES’ LOCKER</span>&mdash;the floor of the ocean.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">DECK</span>&mdash;floor or other horizontal surface, especially on a ship.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">DOGWATCH</span>&mdash;the period of time at sea between 4 and 6 <span class="sc">P.M</span>. (first dogwatch) or 6 and 8 <span class="sc">P.M</span>. (second dogwatch).</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">DRILL</span>&mdash;a standardized sequence of actions designed to react to a possible situation; used to practice skills and improve proficiency.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">DUFFLE</span> or <span class="cbold">DUFFEL</span>&mdash;a sailor’s personal effects. Referring not only to the sailor’s clothing but also the seabag in which he carries and stows it, the term comes from the Flemish town of Duffel near Antwerp, where a rough woolen cloth made there was often used to make the seabags.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">EASE THE RUDDER</span>&mdash;decrease the current rudder angle (with zero degrees being amidships). This command is normally given when the ship is turning too fast or is coming to the course required, e.g., “Ease your rudder to 5 degrees.”</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">ELEVATORS</span>&mdash;Each of a carrier’s four deck-edge elevators can lift two aircraft from the cavernous hangar deck to the 4.5-acre flight deck in seconds.</p>
<p class="year"><a id="calibre_link-3025" class="calibre3"></a><span class="cbold">FATHOM</span>&mdash;a standardized nautical unit of measurement equaling six feet, usually referring to depth of water.</p>

<p class="year"><span class="cbold">HATCH</span>&mdash;doorway.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">HEAD</span>&mdash;a ship’s toilet, or, more generally, any toilet.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">JONES, CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL (1747&ndash;1792)</span>&mdash;acknowledged as the “Father of the American Navy,” Revolutionary War naval hero. As a ship’s captain, he made daring raids along the British coast, including the famous victory of the <span class="italic">Bonhomme Richard</span> over HMS <span class="italic">Serapis</span>, where Jones is reputed to have said, “I have not yet begun to fight!” when asked to surrender.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">KEELHAUL</span>&mdash;a naval punishment used by some European navies in the 15th and 16th centuries. A rope was rigged from yardarm to yardarm under the bottom of the ship, and the offender was secured to it, sometimes with weights on his legs. He was hoisted up to one yardarm and then dropped suddenly into the sea, hauled underneath the keel or bottom of the ship, and then hauled up to the other yardarm. Because many ships accumulated barnacles and other rough places on the underside of the ship’s hull&mdash;and because it took a significant amount of time to haul the offender underneath a larger ship, all underwater&mdash;not all recipients survived the procedure.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">KNOT</span>&mdash;a unit of speed measuring one nautical mile (1.15 statute miles, 1.85 km) per hour.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">“MAN OVERBOARD”</span>&mdash;a command directing designated sailors to man their boat or boats and pick up the man as soon as possible; special conditions may apply for wartime.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">“MAN YOUR BOAT”</span>&mdash;a command for all hands or designated sailors to take their stations in the boats used for abandoning ship or moving outside the ship to another ship, dock, etc.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">MARINE CORPS BIRTHDAY</span>&mdash;One of the most famous Marine customs is the observance of the Marine Corps Birthday. Since 1921, the birthday of the Marine Corps has been officially celebrated each year on November 10, since it was on this date in 1775 that the Continental Congress resolved “that two Battalions of Marines be raised.” Over the years, the event has been celebrated in a wide variety of ways, but the celebration generally involves the reading of an excerpt from the Marine Corps Manual and a birthday message from the Marine Corps Commandant; the cutting of a birthday cake by the commanding officer; and the presentation of the first and second pieces of cake to the oldest and youngest Marines present. In recent years, the ceremony for the Marine Corps Birthday observance by large posts and stations has been incorporated into written directives.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">MAYDAY</span>&mdash;internationally recognized distress call used on voice radio for vessels and people in serious trouble at sea or in the air. Derived from the French <span class="italic">m’aidez</span> (“help me”) and officially recognized by an international telecommunications conference in 1948.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">“MEATBALL”</span>&mdash;a series of lights that aids carrier pilots when lining up for landing. In the center are amber and red lights with Fresnel lenses. Although the lights are always on, the Fresnel lens makes only one light at a time seem to glow, as the angle at which the pilot looks at the lights changes. If the lights appear above the green horizontal bar, the pilot is too high. If it is below, the pilot is too low, and if the lights are red, the pilot is very low. If the red lights on either side of the amber vertical bar are flashing, it is a wave-off, meaning “don’t land.”</p>
<p class="year"><a id="calibre_link-3026" class="calibre3"></a><span class="cbold">NAUTICAL MILE</span>&mdash;unit of measurement used in air and sea navigation equal to 1,852 meters or about 6,076 feet; derived from the length of one minute of arc of a great circle.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">OFFICER OF THE DECK</span> <span class="cbold">(OOD)</span>&mdash;is always on the bridge when the ship is under way. Each OOD stands a four-hour watch and is the officer designated by the commanding officer to be in charge of the ship. The OOD is responsible for the safety and operation of the ship, including navigation, ship handling, communications, routine tests and inspections, reports, supervision of the watch team, and carrying out the Plan of the Day. Also on the bridge are the helmsman, who steers the ship, and the lee helmsman, who operates the engine order control, telling the engine room what speed to make. There are also lookouts, and the <span class="bold">boatswain’s mate of the watch (BMOW)</span> who supervises the helmsman, lee helmsman, and lookouts. The <span class="bold">quartermaster of the watch</span> assists the OOD in navigation, reports all changes in weather, temperature, and barometer readings, and keeps the ship’s log.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">ON THE DOUBLE</span>&mdash;quickly, on the run.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">PORT</span>&mdash;referring to the left side of a ship when facing the bow, or front.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">“PRI-FLY”</span>&mdash;Primary Flight Control (“Pri-Fly”) is the control tower for the flight operations on the carrier. Here, the “air boss” controls takeoffs, landings, aircraft in the air near the ship, and the movement of planes on the flight deck, which resembles a well-choreographed ballet.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">RUDDER AMIDSHIPS</span>&mdash;orient the rudder along the long axis of the ship; straight ahead.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">RUNNING LIGHTS</span>&mdash;Required on all boats over 15 ft. (5 m) by international regulations, these lights are red on the left (port) side, green on the right (starboard) side, and white to the rear. Side running lights are visible from both the side and front of the craft.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">SCUBA</span>&mdash;an acronym for “self-contained underwater breathing apparatus.”</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">SCUTTLEBUTT</span>&mdash;gossip or rumors; because sailors stopped to talk and exchange gossip when they gathered at the cask of drinking water (called a “scuttlebutt”) on board sailing ships, this became Navy slang referring to information or speculation, and eventually slang for any gossip or rumor. (A <span class="italic">butt</span> was a wooden cask for holding water or other liquids; to <span class="italic">scuttle</span> was to drill a hole, as when one taps a cask.)</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">SEMPER FIDELIS</span>&mdash;Latin for “always faithful,” the motto of the Marine Corps.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">SEMPER PARATUS</span>&mdash;Latin for “always ready,” the motto of the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">SHIPSHAPE</span>&mdash;in good order and function; squared away.</p>

<p class="year"><span class="cbold">“STEADY AS YOU GO”</span>&mdash;maintain the course the ship is on at the moment the command is given.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">STERN</span>&mdash;the rear of the ship.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">STRIKING THE COLORS/ENSIGN/FLAG</span>&mdash;Lowering or “striking” the ship’s flag is the universally recognized sign of surrender.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">“TOE THE LINE”</span>&mdash;Once a literal command to gather on deck with one’s toes on a line, now it means to give full obedience to orders or give extra attention to detail.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">“TURN TO”</span>&mdash;begin ship’s work.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">UNCOVER</span>&mdash;to remove one’s hat or headgear.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">UP ANCHOR</span>&mdash;raise the anchor and prepare to get under way.</p>
<p class="year"><a id="calibre_link-3027" class="calibre3"></a><span class="cbold">“VERY WELL”</span>&mdash;an officer’s response indicating that a report is understood.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">WARDROOM</span>&mdash;the officer’s dining room that is also used for meetings and other functions.</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">WATCHES</span>&mdash;Watches at sea are divided into four-hour intervals:</p>
<p class="indentt">Morning watch: 4 <span class="sc">A.M</span>. to 8 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> (0400&ndash;0800 hours)</p>
<p class="indentt">Forenoon watch: 8 <span class="sc">A.M</span>. to noon (0800&ndash;1200 hours)</p>
<p class="indentt">Afternoon watch: noon to 4 <span class="sc">P.M</span>. (1200&ndash;1600 hours)</p>
<p class="indentt">Dogwatch: 4 <span class="sc">P.M</span>. to 8 <span class="sc">P.M</span>. (1600&ndash;2000 hours) (also divided into first and second dogwatches)</p>
<p class="indentt">Nightwatch: 8 <span class="sc">P.M</span>. to midnight (2000&ndash;2400 hours)</p>
<p class="indentt">Midwatch: midnight to 4 <span class="sc">A.M</span>. (2400&ndash;0400 hours)</p>
<p class="year"><span class="cbold">“WHAT’S YOUR HEADING?”</span>&mdash;a directive to report the course (compass heading) the ship is on.</p>

<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2438" href="#calibre_link-2550" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">INTRODUCTION</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Science can generally be divided into life, physical, and earth sciences, although there is a great deal of overlap between these categories. The science-related questions on the three military flight aptitude tests focus primarily on the physical sciences as they relate to aviation and aerospace concerns, so this review will focus on those areas, too, with special emphasis on mechanical comprehension.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2439" href="#calibre_link-2551" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">scientific method</span> is an organized way of solving problems and explaining phenomena. It has evolved over many centuries with contributions from many cultures, with some early versions dating back to 1600 <span class="sc">B.C</span>. Today’s versions differ in details and labels, but roughly follow the same thought process:</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="cbold"><span class="nl">1.</span></span> <span class="cbold">OBSERVATION.</span> This step requires the accurate observation and recording of a specific occurrence. The accuracy of an initial sighting can be confirmed when a number of independent observers agree that they see the same set of circumstances occurring under the same conditions multiple times. This step includes collecting information, making observations, and asking questions, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="cbold"><span class="nl">2.</span></span> <span class="cbold">HYPOTHESIS.</span> A temporary or working conclusion based on a set of observations, or <span class="italic">hypothesis</span>, is usually a very general statement about why (based on the observations to that point) the scientist thinks something happens in the way that it does. It usually suggests the need for an experiment.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="cbold"><span class="nl">3.</span></span> <span class="cbold">EXPERIMENT.</span> Scientists perform <span class="italic">experiments</span> to test a specific hypothesis. Reliable experiments require controlled conditions and careful recording of data.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="cbold"><span class="nl">4.</span></span> <span class="cbold">THEORY.</span> A hypothesis becomes a <span class="italic">theory</span> when it is supported by one or more experiments; the original hypothesis is usually modified somewhat based on experimental data before it is acknowledged as a theory.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="cbold"><span class="nl">5.</span></span> <span class="cbold">LAW OR PRINCIPLE.</span> When a theory is repeatedly confirmed over a long period of time by multiple experiments, it is called a <span class="italic">law</span> or <span class="italic">principle</span>.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-3030" class="calibre3"></a>It’s often helpful to identify a <span class="italic">mnemonic</span> (memory aid) for the steps in the scientific method.</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> Observation</p>

<p class="noindent1">One way to help you remember these steps in order is to make up a sentence where each word starts with the same letter as the steps you want to remember (interestingly, most people remember odd or silly sentences better). A popular example is a sentence used to help remember the names and order of the planets in the solar system:</p>

<p class="noindent1">When Pluto was still considered a planet, this sentence ended with “nine pizzas” instead of “noodles.” There are lots of variations.

<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2440" href="#calibre_link-2552" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">PHYSICAL SCIENCE</span></a></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Meteorology</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Meteorology is the study of <span class="italic">weather</span> (the condition of the atmosphere at a certain time and place) and <span class="italic">climate</span> (the average of weather conditions in a particular place over a span of time).</p>
<p class="indent">Further, weather describes the interaction of several atmospheric conditions&mdash;temperature, air pressure, wind, humidity, and so on&mdash;that are themselves influenced by other factors.</p>
<p class="nlt"><span class="cbold"><span class="nl">1.</span></span> The local temperature is affected by the angle of the sun’s rays, what season it is currently (and therefore the position of Earth relative to the sun), the length of the daylight period (also affected by the season), the altitude, the nearness of any large bodies of water, and so on.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="cbold"><span class="nl">2.</span></span> The local air pressure depends mostly on temperature and humidity; warm air is lighter than cold air, and moist air is heavier than dry air. Changes in atmospheric pressure are measured on a <span class="italic">barometer</span>.</p>
<p class="nl1"><span class="cbold"><span class="nl">3.</span></span> Wind is air moving from one place to another; it is caused by differences in air pressure. Winds move from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure.</p>
<p class="nl1"><a id="calibre_link-3031" class="calibre3"></a><span class="cbold"><span class="nl">4.</span></span> Humidity is the amount of moisture in the air; <span class="italic">relative humidity</span> is a percentage of how much water vapor the local air <span class="italic">could</span> hold at a given temperature. When the air is warm and dry, moisture on Earth’s surface tends to <span class="italic">evaporate</span> (turn into vapor); when the air is <span class="italic">saturated</span> or completely filled with moisture, a decrease in temperature will cause the moisture in the air to <span class="italic">condense</span> (form droplets) and <span class="italic">precipitate</span> (fall) as rain, sleet, snow, or hail.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">The Atmosphere</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Earth’s atmosphere has six layers that perform many functions, including keeping Earth’s temperatures within an acceptable range, transmitting sound energy, and protecting us from most of the sun’s harmful rays.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">TROPOSPHERE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The troposphere is the densest part of the atmosphere; almost all weather is in this layer. It starts at Earth’s surface and extends to an altitude of 5&ndash;9 miles (8&ndash;14.5 km) high.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">STRATOSPHERE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The stratosphere starts just above the troposphere and extends to 31 miles (50 km) high. The ozone layer, which absorbs and scatters solar ultraviolet radiation, is in this layer.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">MESOSPHERE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The mesosphere starts just above the stratosphere and extends up to 53 miles (85 km) above the surface. Meteors usually burn up in this layer of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">THERMOSPHERE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The thermosphere starts just above the mesosphere and extends out to about 370 miles (595 km). The northern lights (<span class="italic">aurora borealis</span>) phenomenon happens here, and most satellites orbit Earth in this layer.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">EXOSPHERE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The upper limit of our atmosphere, the exosphere, extends from the top of the thermosphere out to about 6,200 miles (9,978 km).</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">IONOSPHERE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The ionosphere is an abundant layer of electrons and ionized atoms and molecules that stretches from about the top of the stratosphere (31 miles/50 km above Earth’s surface) to the edge of space at about 600 miles (966 km), overlapping the mesosphere and the thermosphere. This dynamic region grows and shrinks based on solar conditions. The ionosphere is a critical link in the chain of sun&ndash;Earth interactions and is also what makes radio communications possible.</p>

</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">CLOUDS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Clouds help regulate Earth’s temperature and bring vital rain to different areas. Clouds develop out of the process of <span class="italic">convection</span>, which changes atmospheric moisture from a gas to a liquid.</p>
<p class="indent">As solar radiation heats the ground and the air immediately above it, the warmed air becomes lighter and rises upward. As the air rises, the temperature decreases, and so does the amount of water vapor the air can hold. This vapor rapidly condenses and forms clouds composed of many billions of tiny water droplets or ice crystals. These droplets are exceedingly small, averaging about 10 microns in diameter (a micron is one-millionth of a meter; ice crystals are much larger but less concentrated). Virtually all types of clouds and precipitation are due to rising air.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, as air sinks, its temperature rises again, and its capacity for holding vapor increases. Then any cloud droplets tend to evaporate and the cloud itself disappears as evaporation changes moisture back from a liquid into a gas.</p>
<p class="indent">Clouds will also form where air masses collide&mdash;two different air masses can’t mix unless they are very similar in temperature and moisture content. If a cold, dry air mass pushes into a warm, moist air mass, the warmer air is forced upward, rapidly producing clouds that bubble up, perhaps ultimately leading to lightning, thunder, and showers. If the cold air retreats, warm air pushing over it can bring a much slower process of lowering and thickening clouds and finally light precipitation in the form of light rain, mist, or drizzle.</p>
<p class="indent">Three major cloud classifications describe their appearance using Latin terms.</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> Cirrus, from the Latin <span class="italic">cirro</span>, meaning “curly” or “fibrous”</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Stratus, from the Latin <span class="italic">strato</span>, suggesting sheets or layers</p>
<p class="bll"><span class="tcn">■</span> Cumulus, from the Latin <span class="italic">cumulo</span>, indicating “heaped” or “piled”</p>
<p class="noindent">By combining these with other terms, a number of different cloud combinations can be described. The Latin word for “shower” is <span class="italic">nimbus</span>, so the technical term for describing the cloud associated with thunderstorms is <span class="italic">cumulonimbus</span>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3034" class="calibre3"></a>Clouds are also categorized by how high above the ground they form.</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">HIGH CLOUDS:</span> <span class="italic">Cirrus</span>, <span class="italic">cirrostratus</span>, and <span class="italic">cirrocumulus</span> clouds are delicate wispy clouds at altitudes above 20,000 feet and are composed of ice crystals (at such altitudes, temperatures are perpetually below freezing).</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">MIDDLE CLOUDS:</span> <span class="italic">Altostratus</span>, <span class="italic">altocumulus</span>, and <span class="italic">nimbostratus</span> clouds are typically found between 6,000 and 20,000 feet in altitude.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">LOW CLOUDS:</span> <span class="italic">Stratus</span>, <span class="italic">cumulus</span>, and <span class="italic">stratocumulus</span> clouds occur at altitudes of 6,000 feet or lower. Stratus clouds appear as smooth, even sheets, from which light rain and drizzle often fall (light snow or freezing drizzle during the winter). Fog is just a stratus cloud reaching to or sitting on the ground. Cumulus clouds can range in size from isolated balls of cotton to big heaps of mashed potatoes in the sky. They are often referred to as “fair weather clouds” because they usually aren’t associated with precipitation, but occasionally they can grow into thunderstorms (<span class="italic">cumulonimbus</span>). They are convective clouds, caused by the sun heating the ground. Stratocumulus clouds, like altocumulus, can appear in a wide variety of different shapes and textures.</p>
<p class="bll"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">CLOUDS OF GREAT VERTICAL DEVELOPMENT:</span> These are the cumulonimbus clouds, often called <span class="italic">thunderheads</span> because they can bring torrential rain, vivid lightning, and thunder. The tops of such clouds may reach up to 60,000 feet or more; ice crystals get sheared off and are carried away by strong winds aloft, forming a flattened shield of cirrus that spreads out in the shape of an anvil. Sometimes hail&mdash;or, more rarely, a tornado&mdash;comes from a cumulonimbus cloud.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Astronomy</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Astronomy is related to and interwoven with both physics and earth science. The <span class="italic">rotation</span> of Earth on its <span class="italic">axis</span> (an imaginary line running between the North and South Poles) causes day and night as one side or the other of the planet faces the sun. Earth’s path, or <span class="italic">orbit</span>, around the sun is not perfectly circular, but it’s Earth’s <span class="italic">axial tilt</span> that causes the seasons. Earth’s axis is tilted 23.5 degrees away from being exactly perpendicular (at right angles) to the plane of its orbit around the sun (you could say that Earth leans over somewhat instead of standing straight up). As Earth orbits the sun, its tilted axis stays pointing in the same direction in relation to its orbit, so throughout the year, different parts of Earth get more or less of the sun’s direct rays, causing the seasons.</p>
<p class="indent">Earth is part of our <span class="italic">solar system,</span> which includes the sun and seven other planets (for a total of eight) with their various moons. Each <span class="italic">revolution</span> of Earth around the sun takes 365.25 days&mdash;which is why we have a leap year every four years, to balance out those accumulated extra quarter days.</p>
<p class="indent">The sun is the largest and most important body in our solar system, containing well over 99 percent of all the mass in the solar system (its diameter is more than a hundred times that of Earth). It provides the heat, light, and other energy that makes life on Earth possible. Electrically charged (and very hot) particles and plasma from the sun’s outer layer&mdash;the <span class="italic">solar wind</span>&mdash;continually stream into space. These vary in density, temperature, and speed, bathing everything in the solar system, sometimes affecting normal magnetic and electromagnetic situations on the planets.</p>
<p class="indent">The four inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) consist mostly of iron and rock and are known as <span class="italic">terrestrial</span> (Earth-like) planets because they’re somewhat similar to Earth in size and composition. The outer planets are huge and have thick, gaseous outer layers, mostly <a id="calibre_link-3035" class="calibre3"></a>hydrogen and helium, giving them compositions more like the sun than Earth. Beneath their outer layers, the pressure of their thick atmospheres turns their insides into liquid, although they may have rocky cores. Rings of dust, rock, and ice chunks surround all the giant planets. Saturn’s rings are the best known, but thin rings also encircle Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-3036"><img src="images/01231.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.2</span> The solar system</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">There is also a band of <span class="italic">asteroids</span>&mdash;large, irregularly shaped chunks of rock, metals, and other materials&mdash;between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, more than two and a half times as far away from the sun as Earth. Most of these asteroids are relatively small, from the size of boulders to a few thousand feet in diameter, but some are much larger (at least 16 are more than 150 miles in diameter). Although there are billions of them, scientists believe their total mass is still less than that of our moon.</p>
<p class="indent">Pluto was considered the ninth and most distant planet of our solar system from its discovery in 1930 until 2006, when the International Astronomical Union classified Pluto as a <span class="italic">dwarf planet</span>. However, not everyone in the scientific community agrees, and the discussion is still ongoing. You should keep Pluto’s current status as a dwarf planet in mind because all three services’ flight aptitude tests have been updated in the past few years. In fact, the AFOQT’s Physical Science subtest is the most likely to include astronomy questions, and it is the most recently updated.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01259.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre37" /></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3037" class="calibre3"></a>Occasionally, Earth’s moon goes into <span class="italic">eclipse</span>. An eclipse happens when one astronomical body cuts off the light from another. A <span class="italic">lunar eclipse</span> happens when Earth comes directly between the sun and the moon, causing Earth’s shadow (<span class="italic">umbra</span>) to fall directly on the moon. Since the moon shines only by way of light reflected from the sun, this position of Earth puts the moon into shadow.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="italic">solar eclipse</span>, the moon is between Earth and the sun so that the umbra (moon’s shadow) sweeps across Earth. Due to the relative size of the bodies involved, the moon’s shadow is very narrow&mdash;only about 170 miles at its maximum. The <span class="italic">penumbra</span> is a much wider area of partial shadow where the sun’s light is only partly cut off.</p>
<p class="indent">Two other types of astronomical bodies that you might be asked about are <span class="italic">comets</span> and <span class="italic">meteors</span>. Comets are mostly gaseous bodies that can be seen from Earth for periods ranging from a few days to months at a time. The <span class="italic">comet head</span> contains a small, brightly reflective nucleus made up of ice, frozen gases, and other particles. When a comet approaches the sun, these gases and particles stream off in the form of a <span class="italic">tail</span>, which can be as long as 100 million miles.</p>
<p class="indent">A meteor is a small piece of <span class="italic">extraterrestrial</span> (i.e., not from Earth) matter that becomes visible when it enters Earth’s atmosphere. In the friction that goes along with its plunge toward Earth, a meteor heats up intensely, usually burning up before it reaches the ground. Those meteors large enough to reach Earth are called <span class="italic">meteorites</span>.</p>
<div class="gbox">
<p class="box_noindent"><span class="gotham-medium1">The glow of a meteor’s appearance, as friction from the atmosphere heats it up, has led to it being (incorrectly) called a “shooting star” or a “falling star.”</span></p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Electric Energy</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Electrons are incredibly small, measuring only about 0.00000000000022 inch (that’s twenty-two hundred-trillionths) in diameter. You may wonder how anything so small can be a source of energy. Much of the answer lies in the fact that electrons move at nearly the speed of light, or 186,282 miles per second. In metric terms that’s about 300 million meters per second. Billions of them can move at once through a wire. The combination of speed and concentration together produces great energy. When a flow of electrons along a conductor occurs, this is commonly referred to as <span class="italic">current flow.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Magnetism and Electricity</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Magnetism and electricity are closely related. Magnetism is used to generate electricity, and electricity produces a magnetic field.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Magnetism</span> is a force that acts between certain objects. The area around a magnet where the force is felt is called a <span class="italic">magnetic field.</span> Electricity flowing through a wire sets up a magnetic field around the wire. A coil of current-carrying wire becomes an <span class="italic">electromagnet</span> with the magnetic field strongest at the two ends of the coil, the north and south <span class="italic">poles</span>. The electromagnet remains magnetic only as long as the electricity flows through it. A magnetic field can also produce electricity. If you pass a wire across a magnetic field, electricity will be generated in the wire; electric generators are based on this principle. The relationship between electricity and magnetism is also used in transformers, relays, solenoids, and motors.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Electric Current</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Electron current</span> is defined as the directed flow of electrons, the direction of which is from a region of negative potential to a region of less negative potential or more positive potential. <a id="calibre_link-3038" class="calibre3"></a>Therefore, electric current can be said to flow from a negative potential to a positive potential. The direction is determined by the polarity of the voltage source.</p>
<p class="indent">Electric current is generally classified into two general types&mdash;direct current and alternating current. A <span class="italic">direct current</span> flows continuously in the same direction, whereas an <span class="italic">alternating current</span> periodically reverses direction.</p>
<p class="indent">A <span class="italic">circuit</span> is a pathway for the movement of electrons. An external force exerted on electrons to make them flow through a conductor is known as an <span class="italic">electromotive force,</span> or <span class="italic">emf</span>, and it’s measured in volts. Electric pressure, potential difference, and emf mean the same thing. For electrons to move in a particular direction, it is necessary for a potential difference to exist between two points of the emf source. If 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons pass a given point in one second, there is said to be one <span class="italic">ampere</span> (A) of current flowing. The same number of electrons stored on an object (a static charge) and not moving is called a <span class="italic">coulomb</span> (C).</p>
<p class="indent">The magnitude or “size” of a current is measured in <span class="italic">amperes.</span> A current of one ampere is said to flow when one coulomb of charge passes a point in one second. Expressed as an equation:</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="images/01282.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre26" /></p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the ampere is too large a unit to be useful. Therefore the <span class="italic">milliampere</span> (mA), one-thousandth of an ampere, or the <span class="italic">microampere</span> (µA), one-millionth (0.000001) of an ampere, is used.</p>
<p class="indent">Current flow is assumed to be from negative (&ndash;) to positive (+) in the explanations here. Electron flow is negative (&ndash;) to positive (+), and we assume that current flow and electron flow are one and the same. This will make explanations simpler as we progress.</p>
<p class="indent">An <span class="italic">ammeter</span> is used to measure current flow in a circuit. A <span class="italic">milliammeter</span> is used to measure smaller amounts, and the <span class="italic">microammeter</span> is used to measure very small amounts of current. A <span class="italic">voltmeter</span> is used to measure voltage. In some instances it’s possible to obtain a meter that will measure both voltage and current plus resistance. This is called a <span class="italic">multimeter,</span> or <span class="italic">volt-ohm-milliammeter</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">A material through which electricity passes easily is called a <span class="italic">conductor</span> because it has free electrons. In other words, a conductor offers very little resistance or opposition to the flow of electrons. All metals are conductors of electricity to some extent; some are much better than others. Silver, copper, and aluminum let electricity pass easily, and silver is a better conductor than copper. However, copper is used more frequently because it is cheaper. Aluminum is used as a conductor where light weight is important.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most important reasons why some materials are good conductors&mdash;and some are not&mdash;is the presence of <span class="italic">free electrons.</span> If a material has many electrons that are free to move away from their atoms, that material will be a good conductor of electricity. Although free electrons usually move in a haphazard way, their movement can be controlled and results in the flow we call <span class="italic">electric current.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Conductors may be in the form of bars, tubes, or sheets. The most familiar conductors are wire. Many sizes of wire are available; some are only the thickness of a hair, and other wires may be as thick as your arm.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3039" class="calibre3"></a>To prevent conductors from touching at the wrong place, they are usually coated with plastic or cloth material called an <span class="italic">insulator.</span> An insulator is a material with very few, if any, free electrons. No known material is a perfect insulator; however, there are materials that are such poor conductors that they are classified as insulators, such as glass, dry wood, rubber, mica, and certain plastics.</p>
<p class="indent">In between the two extremes of conductors and resistors are <span class="italic">semiconductors</span>. Semiconductors in the form of transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits or chips are used every day in electronic devices. Materials used in the manufacture of transistors and diodes have a conductivity halfway between that of a good conductor and a good insulator. Therefore, the name <span class="italic">semi</span>conductor is given to them. Germanium and silicon are the two most commonly known semiconductor materials. Through the introduction of small amounts of other elements (called impurities), these nearly pure (99.999999 percent) elements become <span class="italic">limited</span> conductors.</p>
<p class="indent">The opposite of conductors are <span class="italic">resistors</span>. Resistors are devices used to give a measured amount of opposition or resistance to the flow of electrons. This opposition to current flow is measured in ohms (<span class="bold">Ω</span>) and indicates the amount of resistance a piece of material offers to the flow of electrons.</p>
<p class="indent">The unit of conductance is the <span class="italic">siemen</span> (formerly the mho, <span class="italic">ohm</span> spelled backward). Whereas the symbol used to represent the magnitude of resistance is the Greek letter omega (<span class="bold">Ω</span>), the symbol used to represent conductance is <span class="italic">S.</span> The relationship that exists between resistance and conductance is a reciprocal one; the reciprocal of a number is one divided by that number. If the resistance of a material is known, dividing its value into one will give its conductance. If the conductance is known, dividing its value into one will give its resistance.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Ohm’s Law</span></p>
<p class="noindent">German physicist Georg Ohm discovered the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in 1827. He found that in any circuit where the only opposition to the flow of electrons is resistance, there is a relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. The strength of the current is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Power</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Power</span> is defined as the <span class="italic">rate</span> at which work is done. It is expressed in metric measurement terms of watts (W) for power and joules (J) for energy work. A <span class="italic">watt</span> is the power that gives rise to the production of energy at the rate of 1 joule per second (W = J/s). A <span class="italic">joule</span> is the work done when the point of application of force of 1 newton is displaced a distance of 1 meter in the direction of the force (J = N <span class="normal">×</span> m).</p>
<p class="indent">It has long been the practice in this country to measure work in terms of horsepower (hp). Electric motors are still rated in horsepower and probably will be for some time, since the United States did not adopt metric standards for everything.</p>
<p class="indent">Power can be electric or mechanical. When a mechanical force is used to lift a weight, <span class="italic">work</span> is done. The rate at which the weight is moved is called <span class="italic">power. One horsepower</span> is defined as 33,000 lbs. being lifted 1 foot in one minute. Energy is consumed in moving a weight or when work is done. It takes 746 W of electric power to equal 1 hp.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3040" class="calibre3"></a>The horsepower rating of electric motors is calculated by taking the voltage and multiplying it by the current drawn under full load. This power is measured in watts, so 1 volt times 1 ampere equals 1 watt. When put into a formula it reads as follows:</p>
<p class="eqn">Power = volts <span class="normal">×</span> amperes or <span class="italic">P = E</span> <span class="normal">×</span> <span class="italic">I</span><br class="calibre2" />where <span class="italic">E</span> = voltage, or emf, and <span class="italic">I</span> = current, or intensity of electron flow</p>
<p class="indent">The kilowatt is commonly used to express the amount of electric energy used or available. Since the term <span class="italic">kilo</span> (k) means one thousand (1,000), a kilowatt (kW) is 1,000 watts. When the kilowatt is used in terms of power dissipated or consumed&mdash;by a home over a month, for instance&mdash;it is expressed in kilowatt hours. The unit kilowatt hour is abbreviated as kWh. It is the equivalent of one thousand watts used for a period of one hour. Electric bills are calculated or computed on an hourly basis and then read in the kWh units.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">milliwatt</span> (mW) means one-thousandth (0.001) of a watt. The milliwatt is used in working with very small amplifiers and other electronic devices. For instance, a speaker used on a portable transistor radio could be rated as 100 milliwatts, or 0.1 W. Transistor circuits are designed in milliwatts, but powerline electric power is measured in kilowatts. Keep in mind that <span class="italic">kilo</span> means 1,000 and <span class="italic">milli</span> means 0.001 (one-thousandth).</p>
<p class="indent">Any time there is movement, there is resistance; this resistance is useful in electric and electronic circuits. Resistance makes it possible to generate heat, control electron flow, and supply the correct voltage to a device. Resistance in a conductor depends on four factors: material, length, cross-sectional area, and temperature. Resistance is measured by a unit called the <span class="italic">ohm</span>, symbolized by the Greek letter <span class="bold">Ω</span> (omega).</p>
<p class="indent">Some materials offer more resistance than others; it depends on the number of free electrons present in the material. The longer the wire or conductor, the more resistance it has, so resistance is said to vary <span class="italic">directly</span> with the length of the wire. However, resistance varies <span class="italic">inversely</span> with the size of the conductor in the cross section&mdash;in other words, the larger the wire, the smaller the resistance per foot of length.</p>
<p class="indent">For most materials, the higher the temperature, the higher the resistance. However, the exceptions to this are devices known as <span class="italic">thermistors.</span> Thermistors change resistance with temperature. They <span class="italic">decrease</span> in resistance with an increase in temperature. Thermistors are used in certain types of meters to measure temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">Resistance causes a voltage drop across a resistor when current flows through it. The voltage is dropped or dissipated as heat and must be eliminated into the air. Some variable resistors can be varied, but can also be adjusted for a particular setting. Resistors are available in various sizes, shapes, and wattage ratings.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Physics</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Matter</span> is defined as anything that occupies space and has mass. <span class="italic">Mass</span> is the quantity of matter that a substance possesses and, depending on the gravitational force acting on it, has a unit of weight assigned to it. Although its weight can vary, the mass of a body is constant and can be measured by its resistance to a change of position or motion.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, an astronaut who weighs 168 pounds here on Earth only weighs about 28 pounds on the moon, but the astronaut still has the same mass. This property of mass, to resist a change of position or motion, is called <span class="italic">inertia</span>. Since matter occupies space, we can compare the masses of various objects that occupy a particular unit of volume or amount of space. This relationship of mass to a unit of volume is called the <span class="italic">density</span> of a substance.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-3041" class="calibre5"></a><span class="bold1">Energy</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Energy</span> is usually defined as the ability to do work. Energy may appear in a variety of forms&mdash;as light, heat, sound, mechanical energy, electrical energy, and chemical energy.</p>
<p class="indent">Two general classifications of energy are <span class="italic">potential energy</span> and <span class="italic">kinetic energy</span>. Potential energy is recognized as the result of the position of an object. Kinetic energy, on the other hand, is energy of motion. The difference between the two can be illustrated by a boulder on the slope of a mountain. While it remains on its high mountain ledge, the boulder has a great deal of potential energy due to its position above the valley floor. If the ledge crumbles, however, and the boulder falls, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2441" href="#calibre_link-2553" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">MECHANICAL COMPREHENSION</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">This section reviews basic physics concepts and how simple machines make work easier.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Force</span></p>
<p class="noindent">One of the basic concepts of physics is the concept of force. Force is something that can change the velocity of an object by making it start, stop, speed up, slow down, or change direction. When you take your foot off the gas pedal of a car, it doesn’t suddenly come to a stop&mdash;it coasts on, only gradually losing its velocity. If you want the car to stop, you have to do something to it.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many types of force.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">FRICTION</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Your car has three controls whose function is to change its velocity: the gas pedal, the brake pedal, and the steering wheel. The brakes make use of the same force that stops your car if you just let it coast: friction.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Sliding friction</span> is a force generated whenever two objects are in contact and there is relative motion between them. When something is moving, friction <span class="italic">always</span> acts in such a direction so as to retard (slow down) the relative motion. Thus, the direction of the force of friction on a moving object will always be directly opposite to the direction of the velocity. The brake shoes slow down the rotation of the wheels, and the tires slow the car until it comes to rest.</p>
<p class="indent">In the simplest case, friction can be measured by using a spring scale.</p>
<div class="keep">

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.3</span> Sliding friction</p>
</div>
<p class="indentt"><a id="calibre_link-3042" class="calibre3"></a>A spring scale can be used to measure all kinds of forces. Basically, it measures the force pulling on its shackle. A spring scale is calibrated in force units&mdash;<span class="italic">pounds</span> or <span class="italic">newtons</span>. A newton (abbreviated N) is a fairly small unit of force; it takes 4.45 newtons to equal 1 pound.</p>
<p class="indent">The image in <a href="#calibre_link-2554" class="calibre3">Figure 8.3</a> shows a spring scale being used to measure the force of sliding friction between a brick and the horizontal surface on which it is resting. The scale is pulling the brick along at constant speed. In this condition, the brick is said to be in <span class="italic">equilibrium</span>. Because its velocity is not changing, it follows that the net force acting on it is zero.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the spring scale is exerting a force, which is indicated on its face. This force is pulling the brick to the right. The brick can remain in equilibrium only if there is an equal force pulling it to the left, so that the net force acting on it is zero. In the situation shown, the only force pulling the brick to the left is the frictional force between the brick and the surface. Therefore, the reading on the spring scale is equal to the force of friction.</p>
<p class="indent">Anyone who has ever moved furniture around or slid a box across the floor knows that the frictional force is greater when the furniture or the box is heavier. The force of friction does not change much as the object speeds up, but it depends very strongly on how hard the two surfaces are pressed together.</p>
<p class="indent">When a solid moves through a liquid, such as a boat moving through the water, there is a frictionlike force retarding the motion of the solid; this is called <span class="italic">viscous drag.</span> Like friction, it always acts opposite to velocity. Unlike friction, however, it increases greatly with speed, and it depends more on the shape of the object and on the nature of the liquid than on the object’s weight. Gases also produce viscous drag, and you are probably most familiar with this as the air resistance that acts on a car at high speed.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">GRAVITY</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Probably the first law of physics that everyone learns is this: If you drop something, it falls. Since its velocity keeps on changing as it falls, there must be a force acting on it during the time that it’s falling&mdash;this is <span class="italic">gravity</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">You can measure gravity by balancing it off with a spring scale. When you hang something on a spring scale and read the scale in pounds or newtons, you usually call the force of gravity acting on the object by a special name. You call it the <span class="italic">weight</span> of the object.</p>
<p class="indent">Weight is not a fixed property of an object; it varies with location. A person who weighs 160 pounds at the North Pole will check in at 159.2 pounds at the equator. If he should step on a scale on the moon, it would read only 27 pounds. Everything weighs less where the acceleration caused by gravity is smaller. Weight, in fact, is directly proportional to the acceleration caused by gravity.</p>
<p class="indent">Obviously, weight also depends on something else, since things have different weights even if they are all at the same place. Weight depends on how much “stuff” (matter) there is in the object. If you buy 10 pounds of sugar, you expect to get twice as much as if you buy five pounds. And if you take both sacks to the moon, one will still weigh twice as much as the other. The amount of sugar, the <span class="italic">mass</span> of the sugar, did not change when it was brought somewhere else. And the more sugar you have, the more it weighs.</p>
<p class="indent">Weight, then, is proportional both to mass and to the acceleration caused by gravity.</p>
<p class="indent">This equation works nicely, without introducing any constants, if the units are carefully defined. Mass is measured by pounds in the English system and in kilograms in the metric system. By definition, when you multiply the mass in kilograms by the acceleration in meters per second squared, the weight comes out in newtons.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3043" class="calibre3"></a>To summarize: Weight&mdash;the force of gravity&mdash;is the product of mass and the acceleration caused by gravity.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">ELASTIC RECOIL</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The basic feature of a solid, as opposed to a liquid or a gas, is that it has a definite shape. It resists changes in its shape and, in so doing, exerts a force against whatever force is applied to it.</p>
<p class="indent">Look, for example, at the board supported at its ends, shown in <a href="#calibre_link-2555" class="calibre3">Figure 8.4</a>. If you push down on it, you bend it, and you can feel it pushing back on you. The harder you push, the more the board bends and the harder it pushes back. It bends just enough to push on you with the same force that you exert on it. The force it exerts is called <span class="italic">elastic recoil</span>.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-2555"><img src="images/01329.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.4</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The same thing happens when you stand on the floor, or on the ground. You can’t see the floor bend, but it bends just the same, just not very much. Even a feather resting on the floor bends it a little. The elastic recoil force needed to support the feather is very small, so the amount of bending is too small to detect.</p>
<p class="indent">A rope does not resist bending, but it certainly resists stretching. When a rope is stretched, it is said to be in a state of <span class="italic">tension</span>. The tension can be measured by cutting the rope and inserting a spring scale into it, as shown in <a href="#calibre_link-2556" class="calibre3">Figure 8.5</a>. The spring scale will read the tension in the rope, in pounds or newtons. If you pull with a force of 30 N, for example, the tension in the rope is 30 N, and that is what the scale will indicate. Something, such as the elastic recoil of the wall to which the scale is attached, must be pulling on the other end with a force of 30 N. The tension in the rope is the same throughout, and is equal to the elastic recoil force that the rope exerts at its ends.</p>
<div class="keep">

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.5</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">To summarize: A force applied to a solid distorts the shape of the solid, causing it to exert a force back on the force that distorted it.</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-3044" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">BUOYANCY</span></p>
<p class="noindent">If you take a deep breath and dive into a pool, you will have trouble keeping yourself submerged&mdash;something keeps pushing you up. That force is called <span class="italic">buoyancy</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The force of buoyancy acts in an upward direction on anything submerged in a liquid or a gas. Buoyancy is the force that makes ships float and helium-filled balloons rise. A rock sinks because its weight is greater than the buoyancy of the water. A submerged cork rises because the buoyancy of the water exerts a force greater than its weight. When it reaches the surface, some of it emerges, but the rest is still under water. The amount under water is just enough to produce a buoyant force equal to its weight, so it stays put.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">OTHER FORCES</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There are some other familiar forces, and others not so familiar. You know about magnetism, which attracts iron nails to a red horseshoe. You have met electric force (static electricity), which makes a nylon shirt cling to you when you try to take it off. Airplanes stay up because of the lift force generated by the flow of air across their wings. A rocket takes off because of the force generated by the gases expanding in it and pushing out behind it.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">ACTION AND REACTION</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The batter steps up to the plate and takes a healthy swing, sending the ball into left field. The bat has exerted a large force on the ball, changing both the magnitude and the direction of its velocity. But the ball has also exerted a force on the bat, slowing it down. The batter feels this when the bat hits the ball.</p>
<p class="indent">Next time up, he strikes out. He has taken exactly the same swing, but exerts no force on anything (air doesn’t count). The batter has discovered that it is impossible to exert a force unless there is something there to push back. Forces exist <span class="italic">only</span> in pairs. When object A exerts a force on object B, then B must exert a force on A. The two forces are sometimes called <span class="italic">action</span> and <span class="italic">reaction,</span> although which is which is often somewhat arbitrary. The two parts of the interaction are equal in magnitude, are opposite in direction, and act on different objects.</p>
<p class="indent">The law of action and reaction leads to an apparent paradox, if you are not careful how it is applied. The horse pulls on the wagon. If the force of the wagon pulling the horse the other way is the same, as the law insists, how can the horse and wagon get started?</p>
<p class="indent">The error in the reasoning is this: If you want to know whether the horse gets moving, you have to consider the forces acting <span class="italic">on the horse</span>. The force acting on the wagon has nothing to do with the question. The horse starts up because the force he exerts with his hooves is larger than the force of the wagon pulling him back&mdash;and the wagon starts moving because the force of the horse pulling it forward is larger than the frictional forces holding it back. To know something moves, consider the forces acting <span class="italic">on</span> it<span class="italic">.</span> The action and reaction forces <span class="italic">never</span> act on the same object.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">BALANCED FORCES</span></p>
<p class="noindent">If a single force acts on an object, the velocity of the object must change. If two or more forces act, however, their effects may eliminate each other. This is the condition of equilibrium, in which there is no net force and the velocity does not change. We saw such a condition in the case in which gravity is pulling an object down and the spring scale, used for weighing it, is pulling it upward.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3045" class="calibre3"></a>An object in equilibrium may or may not be at rest. A parachutist, descending at constant speed, is in equilibrium. His weight is just balanced by the viscous drag on the parachute, which is why he put it on in the first place. A heavier parachutist falls a little faster; his speed increases until the viscous drag just balances his weight.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01380.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="indent">Balancing the vertical forces is not enough to produce equilibrium. An airplane traveling at constant speed is in equilibrium under the influence of four forces, two vertical and two horizontal. Vertical: Gravity (down) is just balanced by the lift (up) produced by the flow of air across the wing. Horizontal: Viscous drag (pulling back, slowing) is just balanced by the thrust of the engines (pushing forward). Both the vertical and the horizontal velocities are constant.</p>
<p class="indent">The brick in <a href="#calibre_link-2554" class="calibre3">Figure 8.3</a>, resting on a tabletop and being pulled along at constant speed, is another example. Vertical: The downward force of gravity is balanced by the upward force of the elastic recoil of the tabletop. Horizontal: The tension in the spring scale, pulling to the right, is balanced by the friction pulling it to the left, opposite to the direction of motion.</p>
<p class="indent">If an object is in equilibrium&mdash;at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line&mdash;the total force acting on it in any direction is exactly equal in magnitude to the force in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Simple Machines</span></p>
<p class="noindent">“Simple machines” are devices that make work easier by changing either the direction or magnitude of an applied force. Without thinking about it, we all use a multitude of simple machines every day&mdash;a light switch, a water faucet, a doorknob, a hammer, a car, or a knife, just to name a few.</p>
<p class="indent">There are six basic simple machines recognized in mechanical physics&mdash;the lever, the inclined plane, the wedge, the wheel and axle, the screw, and the pulley&mdash;and all of them have been in use for thousands of years. In theory, all complex machines are made up of parts derived from these six simple machines. The principles behind some of them were quantified by Archimedes, the Greek mathematician, engineer, and inventor.</p>
<p class="indent">And, even though not on the “official” list, we will discuss the hydraulic jack, as well as a few complex machines that are good examples of combinations of simple machines.</p>
<p class="indent">Simple machines are useful because of their ability to perform <span class="italic">work</span>, which is defined as applying force over a distance. The effort multiplied by the effort distance is called the <span class="italic">work input</span>, and the load multiplied by the load distance (distance the load travels) is the <span class="italic">work output</span>. Machines create a greater output force than the amount of force input to them; the <a id="calibre_link-3046" class="calibre3"></a>ratio of these forces is the <span class="italic">mechanical advantage</span> of the machine. Simple machines can also be used in combinations to create even greater mechanical advantages, as in a bicycle.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">The Work Principle</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Work</span> is done whenever a force moves something through or over a distance. The formula for measuring the amount of work done is <span class="italic">W</span> = <span class="italic">F</span> × <span class="italic">d</span> (force multiplied by distance). If you stand still holding a very large rock over your head, you might get tired, but in this physics context, you aren’t doing any <span class="italic">work</span> because you aren’t moving any load or weight over any distance.</p>
<p class="indent">The force to get something moved (and therefore result in work performed) is measured in newtons or pounds-force (lb<span class="sub1">f</span>). A <span class="italic">newton</span> (named for Sir Isaac Newton, English scientist) is the force required to move one kilogram one meter in one second. A <span class="italic">pound-force</span> (to prevent confusion with the pound as a <span class="italic">mass</span> unit of measurement) is equal to 4.44822162 newtons, or the amount of force required to accelerate one <span class="italic">slug</span> (32.17405 pounds-mass or lb<span class="sub1">m</span>) at a rate of 1 ft./sec.<span class="sup">2</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The purpose of a machine is to make it possible to exert a large force on the load with a smaller effort. You could say that a machine magnifies force or effort. The amount of this magnification&mdash;the ratio of load to effort&mdash;is called the <span class="italic">mechanical advantage</span> of the machine. It can be shown algebraically like this:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01398.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre38" /></p>
<p class="indent">Something else to consider in this area is the direction of a force applied to an object, and how that direction affects the amount of work that is done on the object. One way to look at it is that only the amount of force that’s in the direction of movement counts. For example, look at <a href="#calibre_link-2557" class="calibre3">Figure 8.6</a> below (the child pulling a smaller child on a sled).</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-2557"><img src="images/01423.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.6</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The tension in the rope held by the larger child is pulling the sled forward, but, because it is applied at an angle, it is also lifting the sled somewhat. Since neither the angle of the rope nor the upward force applied to it are enough to overcome the force of gravity, only the component or part of the forward-directed force is doing the work of moving the sled.</p>
<p class="indent">The angle between the direction of actual movement and the direction in which the force is applied is known as <span class="italic">theta</span> (Greek symbol θ) and is measured in degrees. If we call the force that creates the tension in the rope to pull the sled <span class="italic">T</span>, the component of the force that actually pulls the sled forward is <span class="italic">T</span> cos θ, or <span class="italic">T</span> (tension) multiplied by the cosine of the angle theta.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3047" class="calibre3"></a>You can probably understand just from the everyday intuitive application of these principles that the smaller the angle θ, the larger the effective force pulling the sled, and the smaller the amount of force that is spent trying to lift it. When θ <span class="normal">= zero, the entire force contributes to moving the sled forward, and there is no effort spent lifting at all. On the other hand, when <br class="calibre2" /></span>θ = 90°, the entire force is lifting the sled and nothing is pulling forward.</p>
<p class="indent">Most mechanical comprehension problems at this level are simplified&mdash;they do not, for instance, take into account the additional impact exerted by forces like friction with the ground, wind resistance (or the push from a tailwind), and so on. This leads us to the idea of a machine’s <span class="italic">efficienc</span><span class="italic">y</span>: the ratio between the work output and the work input, expressed as a formula like this:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01437.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre27" /></p>
<p class="indent">Efficiency is usually expressed as a percentage that tells us what fraction of the work put into a machine comes out as useful work at the other end.</p>
<p class="indent">The next concept in this area that you need to know is the concept of <span class="italic">vectors</span>. A vector is any physical quantity that requires both a direction and an amount of force or <span class="italic">magnitude</span>. A vector is shown graphically as an arrow, where the length of the arrow represents the vector’s magnitude, and the angle θ (sound familiar?) between the vector and a designated axis defines the vector’s direction.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">The Lever</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Levers are a very common type of simple machine. A lever consists of a rigid bar that is supported at some point (the <span class="italic">fulcrum</span> or <span class="italic">pivot</span>), and has a load at some other point on the bar. The lever shown in <a href="#calibre_link-2558" class="calibre3">Figure 8.7</a> is fairly typical. The load is the weight of the rock being lifted; the effort is the force exerted by the person trying to move the rock; and the fulcrum is the smaller rock supporting the lever.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-2558"><img src="images/01462.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.7</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Applying a force to one end of the bar causes it to pivot about the fulcrum, causing a magnification of the force applied to the load at another point along the bar. The torque or force around the pivot that is exerted by the worker is <span class="italic">F</span><span class="sub1">E</span><span class="italic">r</span><span class="sub1">E</span>, where <span class="italic">r</span><span class="sub1">E</span> (the <span class="italic">effort arm</span>) is the distance from the point where the effort is applied to the pivot. Similarly, the torque produced by the weight of the rock is <span class="italic">F</span><span class="sub1">L</span><span class="italic">r</span><span class="sub1">L</span>, where <span class="italic">r</span><span class="sub1">L</span> is the load arm. If the system is rotating in equilibrium, these two torques must have the same magnitude, so</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="italic">F</span><span class="sub1">E</span><span class="italic">r</span><span class="sub1">E</span> = <span class="italic">F</span><span class="sub1">L</span><span class="italic">r</span><span class="sub1">L</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-3048" class="calibre3"></a>from which we find that the mechanical advantage, <span class="italic">F</span><span class="sub1">L</span>/<span class="italic">F</span><span class="sub1">E</span>, is given by</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01489.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre39" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Or, in other words, in a lever the mechanical advantage is equal to the ratio of effort arm to load arm.</p>
<p class="indent">For many kinds of levers, friction at the pivot is quite small, so efficiencies approach 100 percent, and the arm ratio is very near the force ratio. Usually, no correction is needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Levers are classified according to the relative positions of the pivot, load, and effort. The three classes of levers are represented by the tools shown in <a href="#calibre_link-2559" class="calibre3">Figure 8.8</a>. In the pliers (first-class lever), the pivot is between the effort and the load. In the nutcracker (second-class lever), it is the load that is between the other two. And in the sugar tongs (third-class lever), the effort is in the middle.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-2559"><img src="images/01511.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.8</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that in the third-class lever (the sugar tongs), the load arm is longer than the effort arm, so the mechanical advantage is less than 1. This lever magnifies distance at the expense of force.</p>
<p class="indent">Mechanical advantage is the ratio of load to effort; in a lever, it is equal to the ratio of effort arm to load arm.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">THE INCLINED PLANE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An inclined plane is a plane (flat) surface set at an angle to another surface. This results in using less effort to achieve the same results by applying the required force over a longer distance. The most basic inclined plane is a ramp; it requires less force to move up or down a ramp to a different elevation than it does to climb or lower oneself to that height vertically.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, a wagon rolls downhill, propelled only by its own weight. But gravity pulls straight down, not at the angle of the road going down the hill. What makes the wagon go is a <span class="italic">component</span> of its weight, a part of its weight acting downhill, parallel to the surface the wagon rests on. A component of a force can act in any direction, not just vertically or horizontally. On the inclined plane, the weight of the wagon has two different effects: It acts <span class="italic">parallel</span> to the surface of the hill, pushing the wagon downhill; and it acts perpendicular (also called <span class="italic">normal</span>) to the surface, pushing the wagon into the surface. As the hill gets steeper, the parallel component becomes larger and the perpendicular (normal) component decreases.</p>
<p class="indent">When the wagon is resting on the surface, the elastic recoil of the surface is just enough to cancel the normal component of the wagon’s weight. If the wagon is to stay in equilibrium, you have to pull on it, uphill, to prevent it from rolling away. If there is no friction, the uphill force needed is the same whether the wagon is standing still or going either uphill or downhill at a constant speed.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3049" class="calibre3"></a>The situation is different if the wagon is moving and there is friction. If the wagon is going uphill, you have to pull harder, because the friction is working against you, holding it back. The total force you need to keep the wagon going is then equal to the parallel component of the weight plus the friction. On the other hand, if you are lowering the wagon down the hill, holding the rope to keep it from running away from you, friction is acting uphill, helping you hold the wagon back. Then the force you must exert is the parallel component of the weight <span class="italic">minus</span> the friction.</p>
<p class="indent">A ramp is a device commonly used to aid in lifting. To raise a heavy load a couple of feet onto a platform, it is common practice to place it on a dolly and wheel it up an inclined plane.</p>
<p class="indent">The work output of an inclined plane is the work that would have to be done to lift the load directly: the weight of the load times the vertical distance it goes. The work input is the actual force exerted in pushing the dolly up the ramp times the length of the ramp.</p>
<p class="indent">The ideal mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is equal to its length divided by its height.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">THE WEDGE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A wedge&mdash;sometimes considered a specific type of inclined plane&mdash;is a double-inclined plane (i.e., both sides are inclined) that moves to exert a force along the lengths of its sides. The force is perpendicular to the inclined surfaces, so it pushes two objects (or portions of a single object) apart. Axes, knives, and chisels are all examples of wedges. The common door wedge used to keep an open door open uses the force on the surfaces of the door and floor to provide friction, rather than separate things, but it’s still basically a wedge.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">THE WHEEL AND AXLE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This simple machine involves a <span class="italic">wheel</span> attached to a rigid bar or <span class="italic">axle</span> in its center. A force applied to the wheel causes the axle to rotate, which can be used to magnify the output force (for example, by having a rope wind around the axle). Alternatively, a force applied to provide rotation to the axle translates into rotation of the wheel. The wheel and axle can be viewed as a type of lever that rotates around a center fulcrum. Ferris wheels, automobile wheels, and rolling pins are examples of wheel-and-axle machines.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">THE SCREW</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A screw is a shaft that has an inclined groove along its surface. It can also be thought of as an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. By rotating the screw (applying a <span class="italic">torque</span>), the force is applied perpendicular to the groove, thereby translating a rotational force into a linear one. Screws are frequently used to fasten objects together (as the hardware screw and bolt combination does), although the Babylonians developed a “screw” that could elevate water from a low-lying body to a higher one (which later came to be known as Archimedes’ screw). Other examples of screws are propellers, fans, and most jar lids.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">THE PULLEY</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The pulley is a wheel with a groove along its edge where a rope or cable can be placed. It uses the principle of applying force over a longer distance&mdash;as well as the tension in the rope or cable&mdash;to reduce the magnitude of the force required to move the load. Complex systems of pulleys can be used to greatly reduce the force that must be applied to move an object.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3050" class="calibre3"></a>For example, a piano mover, unable to fit the instrument into the staircase, decides to raise it outside the building to a window. He attaches it to a set of ropes and wheels that, somehow, make it possible for him to lift it with a force considerably smaller than the weight of the piano. How does this work?</p>
<p class="indent">Consider first the heavy block in <a href="#calibre_link-2560" class="calibre3">Figure 8.9</a> suspended from two ropes. The upward force on the block is the tension (<span class="italic">T</span>) in the ropes, and the sum of the two tensions must equal the weight of the block. If the whole system is symmetrical, each rope is under tension equal to half the weight of the block.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-2560"><img src="images/01532.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.9</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now look at <a href="#calibre_link-2561" class="calibre3">Figure 8.10</a>, where the block has been attached to a wheel. There is now only one rope, which passes over the wheel. The tension in the rope is the same throughout; if it were different on one side than on the other, the wheel would turn until the tension on the two sides equalized. The tension in the rope is still only half the weight of the block, since it exerts <span class="italic">two</span> upward forces on the block. Now we have a system that helps in lifting things. Just fasten one end of the rope to a fixed support and pull on the other end (<a href="#calibre_link-2562" class="calibre3">Figure 8.11</a>). Now you can raise the block with a force equal to only half its weight.</p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="images" id="calibre_link-2561"><img src="images/01556.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre36" /></p>
<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.10</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Are you getting something for nothing? Well, yes and no. True, you can now lift the weight with less force, but you have to pull the rope farther than you would if you lifted the block directly. Every time you pull 10 feet of rope through your hands, the block rises 5 feet. You might look at it this way: If the block rises 5 feet, <span class="italic">both</span> sides of the supporting rope have to shorten 5 feet, and the only way to accomplish this is to pull 10 feet of rope through. You raise the block with only half the force, but you have to exert the force through twice the distance.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3051" class="calibre3"></a>You might prefer to pull in a downward direction rather than upward, and you can manage this by attaching a fixed wheel to the support and passing the rope around it as in <a href="#calibre_link-2563" class="calibre3">Figure 8.12</a>. The tension in the rope is still only half the weight of the block; the fixed pulley does nothing but change the direction of the force you exert.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.11</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s learn some vocabulary. The weight of the object being lifted is called the <span class="italic">load</span>, and the distance it rises is the <span class="italic">load distance</span>. The force you exert on the rope is the <span class="italic">effort</span>, and the distance through which you exert that effort is the <span class="italic">effort distance</span>. With a single movable pulley in use, the effort is half the load and the effort distance is twice the load distance.</p>

<p class="figcap"><span class="bold">Figure 8.12</span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3052" class="calibre3"></a>There are ways to string up a system of pulleys that will reduce the effort still further. <a href="#calibre_link-2564" class="calibre3">Figure 8.13</a> shows how the same two pulleys can be connected to a rope in such a way as to divide the load among three strands of rope instead of two. This is done by fastening one end of the rope to the load instead of to the fixed support. Unfortunately, when you do this, you have to shorten all three strands when you raise the object, and the effort distance becomes three times the load distance. By using more pulleys you can reduce the effort still further. Unfortunately, there is a limit to how much you can reduce the effort. The analysis we did so far neglects a few things, such as friction and the weight of the movable pulleys themselves. Every time you add a pulley, you increase the friction in the system; if it is a movable pulley&mdash;the only kind that produces a reduction in force&mdash;you have to lift it along with the load. The effort in any real system is always larger than the ideal effort we calculated by dividing up the load. If there are a lot of pulleys, it may be considerably larger. And friction, although it increases the force you must exert, has no effect on the distance you have to pull that rope.</p>

<p class="h3n"><span class="bold">THE HYDRAULIC JACK</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Liquids are almost incompressible. This property makes them suitable as a means of transforming work from one type to another.</p>
<p class="indent">A hydraulic jack is a device in which force is applied to the oil in a small cylinder. As shown in <a href="#calibre_link-2565" class="calibre3">Figure 8.14</a>, this force causes some of the oil to be transferred to a larger cylinder. This forces the piston in the larger cylinder to rise, lifting a load.</p>
<p class="indent">This device takes advantage of the fact that oil, being nearly incompressible, transmits whatever pressure is applied to it. The pressure applied in the small cylinder appears unchanged in the big one, pushing up its piston.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3053" class="calibre3"></a>The ideal mechanical advantage is the ratio between effort distance and load distance; for a hydraulic jack, it is equal to the ratio of the area of the load piston to that of the effort piston.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">You may see a test problem that involves an application of these principles by showing you two cylinders of different sizes, connected by a hydraulic line or the equivalent, and each containing a piston that is either forcing the fluid in one cylinder down or being pushed up by actions in the other cylinder; alternatively, you may see a problem where there is a piston in only one cylinder. In either case, you will have to be able to understand the effects of mechanical advantage in these different-sized cylinders.</p>

<p class="tipp"><span class="bold">The volume of the oil being transferred from one piston to another does not change&mdash;only the size of the piston will change.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The question will give you some indication of the size of the cylinders, such as the diameter of the cylinder (or the piston within, which for purposes of the problem is assumed to be the same as the cylinder). It’s good to remember that the volume of the oil being transferred from one piston to another does not change&mdash;only the dimensions of the piston change. Since the volume of a cylinder is V = π<span class="italic">r</span><span class="sup">2</span><span class="italic">d</span> or <span class="italic">ad</span> (where <span class="italic">a</span> is the area of the circular part of the cylinder and <span class="italic">d</span> is the diameter of the cylinder), then <span class="italic">a</span><span class="sub1">1</span><span class="italic">d</span><span class="sub1">1</span> = <span class="italic">a</span><span class="sub1">2</span><span class="italic">d</span><span class="sub1">2</span>, and the formula for mechanical advantage in this kind of problem is</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01693.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre38" /></p>
<p class="noindent">where <span class="italic">a</span><span class="sub1">1</span> is the area of the smaller cylinder and <span class="italic">a</span><span class="sub1">2</span> is the area of the bigger cylinder, and <span class="italic">d</span><span class="sub1">1</span> is the vertical distance moved by the smaller cylinder and <span class="italic">d</span><span class="sub1">2</span> is the vertical distance moved by the larger cylinder. In a case where the smaller cylinder is two inches in diameter, for example, and the bigger one is eight inches, the mechanical advantage would be <img src="images/01719.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre22" />. Therefore, if the larger piston was pushed down one inch, the piston in the smaller cylinder would be correspondingly pushed upward four times that amount, or four inches. By the same token, if the piston in the smaller cylinder is pushed down four inches, for example, the piston in the larger cylinder would only be pushed upward one inch.</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-3054" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">THE VISE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The vise of <a href="#calibre_link-2566" class="calibre3">Figure 8.15</a> is a complex machine in which the handle acts as a lever operating a different kind of machine: a screw. How can we calculate the constants of this gadget? It would be very difficult to calculate the ratio of the force the jaws apply to the force on the handle. The best we can do is work with the distances.</p>
<p class="indent">A screw consists of a single continuous spiral wrapped around a cylinder. The distance between ridges is known as the <span class="italic">pitch</span> of the thread, as shown in <a href="#calibre_link-2567" class="calibre3">Figure 8.16</a>. Every time the screw makes one complete turn, the screw advances a distance equal to the pitch. In the vise, one complete turn is made when the end of the handle travels in a circle whose radius is the length of the handle (<span class="italic">l</span>). Therefore, when the effort moves a distance 2π<span class="italic">l</span>, the load moves a distance equal to the pitch of the thread. Therefore, for a screw,</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01740.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw1" /></p>

<p class="indent">However, if you use this expression to calculate the forces, you will get it all wrong. The vise is a high-friction device. It has to be, for it is the friction that keeps it from opening when you tighten it. A vise is a self-locking machine because its efficiency is considerably under 50 percent.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Machines That Spin</span></p>
<p class="noindent">What is the mechanical advantage of a winch, such as that shown in <a href="#calibre_link-2568" class="calibre3">Figure 8.17</a>? The principle is not much different from that of a lever. Because the crank and the shaft turn together, the torque exerted by the effort (the force on the handle) must be equal to the torque exerted by the load (the tension in the rope). The mechanical advantage, then, is the ratio of the radius of the crank to the radius of the shaft.</p>
<div class="keep">

<p class="indent">In mechanical devices, gears are commonly used to change torque. Consider the gears of <a href="#calibre_link-2569" class="calibre3">Figure 8.18</a>, for example. We assume that both gears are mounted on shafts of equal diameter, and that the small gear is driving the large one. What is the mechanical advantage of this combination?</p>

<p class="indent">First of all, the teeth must have the same size and spacing on both gears for them to mesh properly. With 12 teeth in the large gear and only four in the small one, the small gear has to make three complete revolutions to make the big one turn once. The large <span class="italic">load</span> or <span class="italic">drive</span><span class="italic">n</span> gear moves only one-third as far as the smaller <span class="italic">effort</span> or <span class="italic">driving</span> gear, and the ratio of the two distances is the same as the ratio of the number of teeth in the two gears. Then we can say that the ideal mechanical advantage of a gear is the ratio of the number of teeth in the load gear to the number of teeth in the effort gear, in this case 3:1.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">Power</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When a piano mover rigs his tackle to hoist a heavy piano up a vertical distance, he has to consider many factors. For one, the more pulleys he adds to the tackle setup, the longer it will take him to get the job done. If he has to pull more rope&mdash;using less force, to be sure&mdash;he will have to keep pulling for a longer time.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a definite limit to the amount of work the mover can do in a given time. The rate at which he does work is called his <span class="italic">power</span>. Power is work done per unit time.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3056" class="calibre3"></a>The English unit of power is the foot-pound per second, and it takes 550 of them to make one horsepower. The SI unit is the joule per second, or <span class="italic">watt</span> (W). A horsepower is 746 watts. The watt is a very small unit, and the kilowatt (= 1,000 W) is commonly used.</p>
<p class="indent">In all the machines we have discussed so far, work comes out the load end as it goes in at the effort end. Thus, the power output of any machine is equal to the power input. Machines do not increase your power. A pulley or a windlass will spread the work out over a longer period of time, so that you can do it with the power available in your muscles and without straining for a force larger than convenient.</p>

<p class="indentt">In addition to preparing you for the Simple Drawings, Hidden Figures, and Spatial Apperception subtests of the SIFT and the Block Counting subtest of the AFOQT, this chapter will also discuss the skills you need to succeed on the Situational Judgment and Table Reading subtests of the AFOQT. While these two subtests don’t require the same kind of visualization skills needed for the other subtests discussed above, they do require some mental skills of their own.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2443" href="#calibre_link-2571" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">BLOCK COUNTING</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The Block Counting subtest on the AFOQT has 30 questions that test your ability to analyze the spatial relationships of a three-dimensional collection of blocks to determine how many other blocks are touched by designated numbered blocks. For purposes of the test, you can consider that every block in the stack is the same size and shape as the other blocks. A block is considered to be touching the numbered block if any part touches it, even if it’s only a corner or an edge. The key to doing well on this test section is being methodical. <span class="italic">Choose one side or edge of the numbered block in question and work your way (mentally) all the way around your numbered block to see how many other blocks are in contact with it.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Let’s look at an example:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01859.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre30" /></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3058" class="calibre3"></a>In this example, Block 1 is touching the block that is parallel to it (between Block 1 and Block 2), as well as the two blocks that are underneath and perpendicular (at right angles) to it, for a total of three blocks. Can you “see” that? Likewise, Block 2 is touching the block that is between it and Block 1, as well as the two blocks that are underneath and perpendicular, for a similar total of three blocks touched.</p>
<p class="indent">Block 3 is in a different circumstance, however; notice that Block 3 is edge-up at the back of this particular stack. Let’s start at the top and work our way all the way around. First, notice the two blocks that are above and perpendicular to Block 3. Next, notice the two blocks (one of them numbered as Block 4) that are lying down where Block 3 is edge-up&mdash;both of them are in contact with Block 3’s vertical face. Finally, there are the two blocks underneath and perpendicular to Block 3; one of them is numbered as Block 5. So, our total number of blocks in contact with Block 3 is six.</p>
<p class="indent">Before we look at the remaining numbered blocks, let’s look at the way your possible answers are presented. This subtest is both like and unlike other multiple-choice tests. It is similar in that you will have several choices&mdash;in this case, five, designated as A through E&mdash;to pick from. Also, you will have to remain careful not to become confused between the several parallel lines of choices. However, there are no more or less attractive-sounding choices, nor are there clues you can deduce from the use of words such as <span class="italic">never</span> or <span class="italic">every</span>&mdash;there are only numbers in a table to pick from, with no difference between them except their value.</p>
<p class="indent">Now it’s time to look at Block 4. Let’s start at the back side of the stack, where we can readily see that Block 3 is touching Block 4. Then there is the block lying on top of Block 4, and then the one at the front of the stack that is perpendicular to Block 4 along its shorter axis, but parallel along the blocks’ longer axis. Then, just as with Block 3, there are the two blocks at the bottom of the stack and perpendicular to Block 4’s long axis. That’s a total of five other blocks in the stack touching Block 4.</p>
<p class="tab_cap"><span class="cbold">KEY</span></p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01883.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre40" /></p>
<p class="indent">The stack of blocks will be presented to you with the table of possible answer choices alongside. Find the numbered block you are analyzing in the left-hand column and then read horizontally across the table until you find the number 5, which was the number of blocks touching Block 4. Reading up from the 5, you can see that the correct answer for Question 4 (which dealt with Block 4) is B. You would, on the test, mark choice B and move on to the next question, which deals with Block 5. How many blocks are touching Block 5? Go ahead&mdash;we’ll wait.</p>
<p class="indent">Right, the number of blocks touching Block 5 is four, so we would mark choice A for Question 5 and move on to the next question.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-3059" class="calibre5"></a><a id="calibre_link-2444" href="#calibre_link-2572" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">SIMPLE DRAWINGS</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">In the Simple Drawings subtest of the Army’s SIFT, each question will present five shapes; four are identical and one is different. Your task will be to identify the letter of the shape that’s different. You will need to work quickly because there are 100 questions and you will only have two minutes&mdash;but don’t guess! The score on this subtest comes from how many questions you get right, and wrong answers count against that score. It’s unlikely that you will be able to get through all 100 questions in the time you’re given, so focus on making the right choice for the ones you do answer. <span class="italic">Don’t</span> start randomly guessing when you think time is about to run out&mdash;it can only decrease your score.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pad"></span>Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01907.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre1" /></p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, choice (D) is different from the others because it is not filled in, so that would be your choice.</p>
<p class="indent">This subtest is deceptively simple, but don’t blow it off. Every point counts! If you get a passing score but it’s only average or below average, you will <span class="italic">not</span> be able to retake the SIFT just to raise your score&mdash;you’ll be stuck with it.</p>
<p class="indent">Everyone is different, but a technique that usually works is to pull your focus back and look at the whole question (all five shapes or figures) at one time. You will probably be able to identify the different shape faster this way versus looking at each choice sequentially. Only practice will tell you what technique works best for you.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2445" href="#calibre_link-2573" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">HIDDEN FIGURES</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The Hidden Figures subtest on the SIFT measures your ability to identify a simple figure hidden within a complex drawing. You will be given a series of five lettered figures&mdash;A, B, C, D, and E&mdash;followed by five numbered drawings. Your objective is to determine which lettered figure is contained within which numbered drawing. Each numbered drawing contains only one of the lettered figures, and the correct figure in each numbered drawing is always the same size and in the same rotational position as it appears in the preceding lettered figure. However, you may find the lettered shape in more than one drawing, or you may not find it at all&mdash;in other words, in each series of five, you may have one or more lettered figures that are not found, and others that are to be found more than once.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes you will be able to spot the figure in the drawing quickly, and sometimes it will take significant study. The drawing with the hidden figures often has overlapping shapes and lines that can create optical illusions, or at a minimum, mask the shape you are looking for. If you can spot the figure quickly, mark that answer on your answer sheet. However, it’s not always easy to spot the hidden figures; it requires trial and error, and sometimes even the process of elimination.</p>
<p class="indent">The best technique to use here is to let your eye focus briefly on the figure you want to find, and then look at the numbered drawing. Think of it as letting a bloodhound sniff something belonging to the person you want him to search for or track. If you don’t see the figure you’re looking for in the first numbered drawing, refocus briefly on the shape to be found and go to the next numbered drawing, and so on until you find the shape. Then mark that answer on your answer sheet.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3060" class="calibre3"></a>It can also be helpful, especially when you are searching for a complex shape, to focus your search on unique angles or other unusual facets of the figure. If you can find that particular angle, odd corner, or whatever, and then find it in the numbered drawing, chances are you have found the shape you’re looking for&mdash;but be sure to confirm that the rest of the figure is there, too, and in the same size and rotational position as in the lettered example.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s look at an example series of five:</p>

<p class="noindent">The Spatial Apperception Test portion of the Army’s SIFT measures your ability to perceive spatial relationships from differing orientations. Specifically, this test measures your ability to determine the attitude or position of an airplane in flight from a representation of the view through the cockpit windshield. Studies have indicated for decades that skill in determining spatial orientation has a significant role in predicting success in flight training.</p>
<p class="indent">On the test, you will be presented with an aerial view of the horizon (as if you were in an aircraft cockpit) and five drawings labeled A, B, C, D, and E, showing planes flying in different attitudes relative to a coastline. Your task for each question is to determine which drawing of a plane in flight correctly matches the attitude that would result in the view that the pilot sees from the cockpit. The planes might be climbing, diving, banking, flying level, flying along the coastline or at an angle to it, flying out to sea or in to land, and so on. You are considered to be looking out from the middle of your windscreen (the front part of the canopy, directly in front of the pilot).</p>
<p class="indent">You should look for three important things as you answer the questions: whether the airplane is climbing or diving (pitch); whether the plane is “wings level” or banking left or right; and the airplane’s heading (where it’s going). If you use a systematic approach of analyzing the drawing representing the pilot’s view from the cockpit, you will be less likely to get confused.</p>
<p class="box_noindentl"><span class="bold">KEY</span></p>
<p class="box_noindentl">Dark Gray = Water</p>
<p class="box_noindent">Light Gray = Land</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00707.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre37" /></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3063" class="calibre3"></a>The first thing you should look for to determine pitch is the <span class="italic">position</span> of the horizon, which indicates whether the plane is climbing, diving, or in level flight. If the horizon is above the middle of the picture, the plane is diving or descending. If it’s below the middle, the plane is climbing. If the horizon is in the middle of the picture and level, the plane is in level flight.</p>
<p class="indent">Another way to think of this is to compare the area above and below the horizon line. If there is more area or space above the horizon than below, the plane is climbing. If there is more area underneath the horizon than above it, the plane is descending or diving. And, if the area above and below are about the same, the aircraft is in level flight. This technique is especially helpful when the airplane is in level flight but is banking one way or the other, causing the horizon to appear to tilt accordingly relative to the edges of the picture.</p>
<p class="indent">The next factor to consider is the <span class="italic">tilt</span> of the horizon. If it’s tilted to the left, the airplane is banking to the right; if the horizon is tilted to the right, the airplane is banking to the left. If the horizon is level&mdash;tilted neither left nor right&mdash;then the plane is in level flight, not banking either left or right.</p>
<p class="box_noindentl"><span class="bold">KEY</span></p>
<p class="box_noindentl">Dark Gray = Water</p>
<p class="box_noindent">Light Gray = Land</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00755.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre1" /></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3064" class="calibre3"></a>The third thing to look for is the aircraft’s <span class="italic">heading</span> (which direction it’s going): out to sea, in from the sea, or along the coastline. This will be indicated by the representation of the land and water at the bottom of each of the five answer choices showing the airplane in flight. The lighter section is the land and the darker part represents the sea or ocean.</p>
<p class="indent">Now that we’ve discussed the view from the cockpit, let’s talk about matching those views up to the external view of the airplane (looking at it from the outside).</p>
<p class="indent">Again, you have to approach this in a systematic way to maximize your chances for success. Determining whether the airplane is climbing, level, or diving is easy&mdash;if the nose is angled up relative to the page, it’s climbing; if it’s headed straight across the page, it’s level; if it’s angled downward, it’s diving.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00803.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre1" /></p>
<p class="indent">Determining the airplane’s bank (or lack thereof) is as simple as seeing if the wings are level or not. If one wing is lower than the other, that’s the direction of bank.</p>
<p class="images"><a id="calibre_link-3065" class="calibre3"></a><img src="images/00847.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre1" /></p>
<p class="indent">To determine whether the airplane is heading out to sea or in toward land, look at the land and water “bar” at the bottom of the illustration. If the lighter section underneath the airplane is on the right side of the picture and the nose of the airplane is pointed to the left, then the airplane is headed out to sea. Or, to look at it another way, if the pilot’s viewpoint picture has sea above land with the horizon line and coastline parallel to each other, you are heading out to sea.</p>
<p class="indent">If the lighter segment underneath the airplane drawing is on the left side of the picture and the nose of the airplane is pointed to the left, then the airplane is headed toward land. Said differently, if the picture has land above sea, with the horizon line and coastline parallel to each other, you are heading in to land.</p>
<p class="indent">If the horizon line and coastline are perpendicular to each other you are heading down the coast. Here you just need to be aware of which way the coastline is&mdash;to your left or right&mdash;to make sure that you select the correct external view of the airplane.</p>
<p class="indent">And, if the horizon line and coastline are neither parallel nor perpendicular, then you are heading at a 45-degree angle relative to the coastline, either heading in toward land or out to sea.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Situational Judgment subtest made its first appearance in the most recent AFOQT revision in 2014. It is unique among the three services’ flight aptitude tests. Your score on this subtest will affect your overall AFOQT score, but it does not <span class="italic">directly</span> affect your Pilot, Combat Systems Officer (CSO), or Air Battle Manager (ABM) composite scores.</p>
<p class="indent">However, since the Situational Judgment subtest is its own composite, it affects your overall score, although the Air Force has not released exactly how this subtest affects it. Situational judgment tests are frequently considered more difficult than verbal, math, or abstract reasoning tests because they are about how <span class="italic">people</span> act and react.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, you need to deal with this subtest as you hopefully would with any new challenge: understand the requirements, take advantage of the advice and resources available to you (like this book), and practice, practice, practice! Laying a firm foundation of preparation and practice will help you increase your chances of success, in this and everything else you do.</p>
<p class="indent">The Situational Judgment subtest measures judgment and decision-making abilities, such as those needed when responding to the types of interpersonal situations often encountered by Air Force junior officers. Test questions are based on real scenarios experienced by junior officers that require core competencies of integrity and professionalism, leadership, resource management, communication, innovation, and mentoring. Test questions are selected based on historical cadet results in Air Force Basic Officer Training and Field Training. “Correct” answers are based on the consensus judgment of identified high-potential Air Force officers.</p>
<p class="indent">In this subtest, you will be presented with a short scenario in which you will usually (but not always) be the leader of a small section, office, or the like. After presenting the situation, the question will give you five answer options and ask which would be the most effective and least effective ways to respond to the scenario.</p>
<p class="indent">You will have 35 minutes to answer 50 questions on 25 scenarios, meaning you will have a little more than a minute for each scenario. This is plenty of time if you stay focused&mdash;the scenarios usually run only about four to six sentences each. Although some actions may seem to be equally effective or ineffective, you only pick one of each&mdash;the best and the worst.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s an example right from the Air Force:</p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Situation I.</span> You have recently been assigned to lead a section comprised of experienced subordinates, but you do not have a full understanding of the mission and tasks. Your subordinates are not helpful when you solicit ideas and information from them. You know it is necessary for you to understand your job and the other section members’ jobs in order to effectively lead your section and accomplish the mission.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Possible actions:</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> Contact the superior who assigned you to the section for further guidance.</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> Contact the individual previously assigned to the section for guidance.</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> Meet privately with the most senior subordinate to discuss the section’s mission.</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> Meet individually with each subordinate to get to know them personally.</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> Call a section meeting, and emphasize that you need everyone’s cooperation in order to help the section succeed.</p>
<p class="nlist">1.<span class="pad"></span>Select the MOST EFFECTIVE action (A&ndash;E) in response to the situation.</p>
<p class="nlist">2.<span class="pad"></span>Select the LEAST EFFECTIVE action (A&ndash;E) in response to the situation.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="calibre_link-3067" class="calibre3"></a>The Air Force AFOQT pamphlet containing this example says either choice (C) or choice (D) is considered most effective, and that choice (A) is considered the least effective. Thirty years of experience in the military tells me that choice (C) would be the most effective, <span class="italic">followed</span> by choice (D)&mdash;and that choice (A) would, in fact, be the least effective because it would show the superior who assigned you to that section that you are unable or unwilling to think on your own.</p>
<p class="indent">What this means to you as the test-taker is that you should read the scenario carefully and consider the choices thoroughly, but don’t agonize over which one to pick&mdash;take your best shot and move on to the next scenario. Here are some useful tips for successfully working through these scenarios (as well as the ones in real life):</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> Read the scenario carefully. Evaluate the relevance of each answer to solving the problem laid out in the scenario.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Use only the information in the scenario. You will have to supplement this with your <span class="italic">general</span> knowledge of how the military works and how organizations and the people in them act and react&mdash;but don’t make assumptions about <span class="italic">specific</span> resources or circumstances not mentioned in the scenario.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Think about your response in light of the Air Force Core Values of <span class="italic">integrity first, service before self,</span> and <span class="italic">excellence in all we do</span> (discussed in more detail later in this section).</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Think about the effects of your response choices in light of the unit or organization’s mission and purpose. Remember that the military can’t afford to make excuses or arbitrarily miss deadlines.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Take the initiative when you can to solve things at your level before you go to your supervisor or commander&mdash;but be willing to ask for help from your subordinates or colleagues when it seems appropriate.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Don’t jump over or skip levels in the chain of command or supervisory chain (military or civilian), either upward or downward. Put yourself in the shoes of your scenario superiors or subordinates and think about how each response choice would look from that perspective.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Think about the effects of your scenario response choices on the situation, your team or unit, and the other people in your organization at both higher and lower levels.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Prioritize which aspects of the scenario are most important to address first. Any answer option that does not move the situation forward will not be the “most effective” action to take. The “least effective” answer option will be one that makes the situation even worse.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Don’t look for the easy or short-term solution. Instead, seek to do what’s right, even if it’s tough&mdash;and balance your goals and agenda with those of your subordinates, colleagues, and the organization.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Don’t try to do everything yourself; keep your subordinates informed, ask their advice, and don’t be afraid to delegate tasks to them while keeping everyone informed.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Look for the most ethical solution. Any answer option that is even slightly unethical or dishonest to anyone involved will not be the correct one. Look for the most virtuous answer if there is one&mdash;demonstrating integrity, respect for others, and conscientiousness.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Keep people in the scenario informed, both up and down the chain of command, in person if possible&mdash;especially when there is a disagreement, friction, or some other kind of contention.</p>
<p class="bl"><a id="calibre_link-3068" class="calibre3"></a><span class="tcn">■</span> Look for a solution that emphasizes teamwork, listening to people, and helping people and teams get better. This may be a solution that puts your individual short-term desires at a lower priority.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Look for a solution that builds and sustains positive, effective relationships within your team and across the broader organization.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> When an individual is the source of some problem or obstacle, don’t be afraid to discuss it with him or her&mdash;but do so in private, and do it with an eye toward improving things in the scenario, not just telling him or her that he or she is wrong. A response option that involves criticizing someone in public is certainly not the “most effective,” but it <span class="italic">will</span> almost certainly be a contender for “least effective.”</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> Look for a creative solution that goes beyond what look like the boundaries of the situation, without breaking the chain of command.</p>
<p class="bll"><span class="tcn">■</span> Look for response choices that are distinct from each other. If two choices seem similar, one may be the most effective or least effective (or it may not)&mdash;but if two choices are similar to each other, one will not be the most effective and the other one the least effective.</p>
<p class="indent">To help you understand the values and qualities that apply to the scenarios and the actions considered most and least effective, here are some highlights of current Air Force doctrine and philosophy. This is not meant to be a recruiting section for the Air Force&mdash;but if you are going to take the AFOQT, this is to familiarize you with how the Air Force thinks about itself and its goals and what it considers important. This is not to say that the Army, the Navy, and the Marines don’t have the same level of standards&mdash;they just don’t have questions about them on their flight aptitude test.</p>

<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">INTEGRITY FIRST</span>&mdash;An Airman is a person of integrity, courage, and conviction. He or she must be willing to control his or her impulses and exercise courage, honesty, and accountability in order to do what is right, even when no one is looking.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">SERVICE BEFORE SELF</span>&mdash;An Airman’s professional duties take precedence over personal desires. Every Airman is expected to have the discipline to follow rules, exhibit self-control, and possess respect for the beliefs, authority, and worth of others.</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">EXCELLENCE IN ALL WE DO</span>&mdash;An Airman strives for continual improvement in self and service in order to propel the Air Force further and to achieve greater accomplishment and performance for themselves and their community.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">The Air Force Vision</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The U.S. Air&nbsp;Force is the world’s preeminent force in air, space, and cyberspace. We maintain that distinction by maintaining our objective of global vigilance, reach, and power, and remaining true to our vision statement: The World’s Greatest Air&nbsp;Force&mdash;Powered by Airmen, Fueled by Innovation. Through shared values, key capabilities, and upholding our Airman’s Creed, we continue to achieve our mission and aim high in all we do.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold1">The Air Force Mission</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Fly, fight, and win in the air, space, and cyberspace.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-3070" class="calibre5"></a><span class="bold1">Organization of the Air Force</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">MAJOR COMMANDS</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The U.S. Air Force is subdivided into 10 major commands (MAJCOMs), which are directly subordinate to Headquarters, U.S. Air Force (HQ USAF), or the Air Staff. MAJCOM headquarters are <span class="italic">management</span> headquarters for a major segment of the Air Force, based on a functional or geographic perspective:</p>
<p class="blt"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">AIR COMBAT COMMAND</span>&mdash;provides Air Force component units for U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Southern Command, and U.S. Central Command</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND</span>&mdash;recruits, trains, and educates Airmen of all ranks</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">AIR FORCE GLOBAL STRIKE COMMAND</span>&mdash;develops and provides combat-ready forces for global strike operations and nuclear deterrence</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">AIR FORCE MATERIEL COMMAND</span>&mdash;provides logistics support and research, development, and acquisition of Air Force weapons and equipment</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">AIR FORCE RESERVE COMMAND</span>&mdash;provides supervision of Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard forces and capabilities, helping to integrate them into active Air Force missions</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">AIR FORCE SPACE COMMAND</span>&mdash;develops and operates military space and cyberspace technologies and capabilities</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">AIR FORCE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND</span>&mdash;provides Air Force component units for U.S. Special Operations Command</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">AIR MOBILITY COMMAND</span>&mdash;provides airlift and aerial refueling for all U.S. Armed Forces</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">PACIFIC AIR FORCES</span>&mdash;provides Air Force component units for the U.S. Pacific Command</p>
<p class="bl"><span class="tcn">■</span> <span class="cbold">U.S. AIR FORCES IN EUROPE&ndash;AIR FORCES AFRICA</span>&mdash;provides Air Force component units for the U.S. European Command and the U.S. Africa Command</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">NUMBERED AIR FORCE</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The numbered air force is a <span class="italic">tactical</span> echelon directly under an operational MAJCOM that supervises specific missions. Numbered air forces have operational units such as wings, groups, and squadrons assigned or attached to them.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">WING</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An Air Force wing has a distinct mission with a specific scope and reports to a numbered air force or HQ USAF. A wing is made up of one or more <span class="italic">groups</span> and is usually commanded by a colonel or a brigadier general.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">GROUP</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A group is made up of several <span class="italic">squadrons</span> and may have a single focus (i.e., operations, logistics, medical, etc.) or may be more independent, with several types of squadrons underneath it. It is commanded by a colonel.</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="calibre_link-3071" class="calibre3"></a><span class="bold">SQUADRON</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A squadron is considered the basic Air Force unit. A squadron is usually made up of <span class="italic">two</span> <span class="italic">flights</span> and (if it is a flying unit) has eight to 24 aircraft; it usually consists of a few hundred Airmen. It is usually commanded by a lieutenant colonel, but it can be commanded by a major or a captain, depending on its size and function.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">FLIGHT</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A flight is the smallest official Air Force unit. It is usually comprised of a dozen to over one hundred people and is commanded by a captain; if it is a flying unit, it typically has four aircraft.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">ELEMENT</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Although not officially recognized as a unit, a flight is usually broken up into three to four evenly distributed <span class="italic">elements</span>, usually led by a lieutenant, although in non-flying units it may be led by a senior NCO. In Air Force security forces, it may be called a <span class="italic">squad</span>, a term borrowed from the Army and Marines, whose land-based missions are similar.</p>

<p class="h"><a id="calibre_link-2448" href="#calibre_link-2576" class="calibre5"><span class="bold1">TABLE READING</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The Table Reading subtest of the AFOQT measures your ability to read a table quickly and accurately. It may seem like a mundane, overly simplistic task to accomplish accurately over and over again&mdash;but the Air Force considers it important enough that it feeds into your Pilot, CSO, and ABM composite scores.</p>
<p class="indent">For this subtest, you will be given a table similar to the one below (more about this shortly). Notice that the X values appear at the top of the table, and the Y values are shown on the left side of the table. The X values are the column values, and the Y values are the row values. For each test question, you are given an X value and a Y value. Your task is to find the block where the column and the row intersect, note the number that appears there, and then find this number among the five answer options.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00936.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre37" /></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3072" class="calibre3"></a>You can see that the column under the X value of +1 intersects with the row to the right of the Y value of +2 in a square that holds the number 33. Therefore, the correct answer is choice (D).</p>
<p class="indent">You will have 40 questions to answer in seven minutes, so you have only about 10 seconds per question&mdash;but that’s plenty of time if you are methodical. Here’s the trick: the actual test will have a much bigger table, and all 40 questions will be from that same table. You won’t have a ruler to help you line up the rows and columns, so you will need to get your eyes and brain working together during this subtest.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) measures aptitudes used by the U.S. Air Force to select candidates for officer commissioning programs and specific officer training programs, including pilot, combat systems officer, and air battle manager.</p>
<p class="indent">As discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-2477" class="calibre3">Chapter 3</a>, the AFOQT consists of 12 timed subtests. The scores from the individual subtests are combined in different ways to generate seven composite scores used to help predict success in selected USAF training programs.</p>

<p class="ntopn">In 1789, Congress established the Department of War, which bore responsibility for the United<br class="calibre2" /> States Army, as well as the Navy and Marine Corps, until the Department of the Navy was<br class="calibre2" /> established in 1798. The services functioned autonomously during this period, with the president,</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">Line</span> as commander in chief, their only common superior. Despite this outward independence, early</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(5)</span> American military history reflects the importance of what are now called joint (multi-service) and <br class="calibre2" />combined (multi-national) operations: the Revolutionary War was won when General George <br class="calibre2" />Washington successfully coordinated American and French naval and land forces to defeat British<br class="calibre2" />forces under Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown; naval operations by Commodore Thomas Macdonough, <br class="calibre2" />Jr. on Lake Champlain were a vital factor in successful ground campaigns against the British during</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(10)</span> the War of 1812; and the joint teamwork displayed by General Ulysses S. Grant and Admiral David <br class="calibre2" />Porter in the 1863 Vicksburg Campaign helped capture the last Confederate-controlled section of <br class="calibre2" />the Mississippi River.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">However, instances of confusion, poor inter-service cooperation, and a lack of coordinated<br class="calibre2" /> joint military action had an adverse impact on operations during the 1898 Cuban campaign of the</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(15)</span> Spanish-American War. As a result, the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy created the <br class="calibre2" />Joint Army and Navy Board in 1903, charged with addressing “all matters calling for cooperation <br class="calibre2" />of the two services.”</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The Board was to be a continuing body that could plan for joint operations and resolve problems <br class="calibre2" />of common concern, but it accomplished little because it could not direct the implementation</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(20)</span> of concepts or enforce decisions. Instead, its main function wound up being commentary on <br class="calibre2" />problems submitted to it by the Secretaries of the Army and the Navy. Consequently, the Board<br class="calibre2" /> had little or no impact on the conduct of joint operations during World War I, when similar joint<br class="calibre2" />command and control difficulties occurred as questions of seniority and command relationships<br class="calibre2" /> between the Army Chief of Staff and the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces had to</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(25)</span> be resolved.</p>

<p class="ntop">Culture is both a “here and now” dynamic phenomenon and a coercive background structure that<br class="calibre2" /> influences us in multiple ways. Culture is constantly reenacted and created by our interactions<br class="calibre2" /> with others and shaped by our own behavior. When we are influential in shaping the behavior and</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">Line</span> values of others, we think of that as “leadership,” which helps us create the conditions for new</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(5)</span> culture formation. At the same time, culture implies stability and sometimes rigidity in the sense<br class="calibre2" /> that how we are supposed to perceive, feel, and act in a given society, organization, or occupation<br class="calibre2" /> has been taught to us by our various socialization experiences and becomes prescribed as a way to<br class="calibre2" /> maintain the “social order.”</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The “rules” of the social order make it possible to predict social behavior, get along with each</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(10)</span> other, and find meaning in what we do. Culture can be thought of as the foundation of the social<br class="calibre2" /> order that we live in and of the rules we abide by. The culture of macrosystems, such as large societies,<br class="calibre2" />is more stable and ordered because of the length of time they have existed. Organizational<br class="calibre2" /> cultures will vary in strength and stability as a function of the length and emotional intensity of<br class="calibre2" /> their actual history from the time they were founded. Occupational cultures will vary from highly</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(15)</span> structured ones, such as medicine, to relatively fluid ones, such as management. Microcultures<br class="calibre2" /> are the most variable and the most dynamic and, therefore, provide special opportunities to study<br class="calibre2" /> culture formation and evolution.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The connection between culture and leadership is clearest in organizational cultures and microcultures.<br class="calibre2" />What we end up calling a culture in such systems is usually the result of the embedding</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(20)</span> of what a founder or a leader has imposed on a group that has worked out. In this sense, culture<br class="calibre2" /> is ultimately created, embedded, evolved, and guided by leaders. At the same time, as the group<br class="calibre2" /> matures and becomes more stable, culture comes to constrain, stabilize, and provide structure and<br class="calibre2" /> meaning to the group members, even to the point of ultimately specifying what kind of leadership<br class="calibre2" /> will be acceptable in the future. If elements of a given culture become dysfunctional, leaders have</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(25)</span> to surmount their own culture and speed up the normal evolution processes with forced, managed<br class="calibre2" /> culture change programs. These dynamic processes of culture creation and management are the<br class="calibre2" /> essence of leadership, and they make us realize that leadership and culture are two sides of the<br class="calibre2" /> same coin.</p>

<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> a refined understanding of the arts and other demonstrations of human intellectual achievement by a certain group.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> the attitudes and behaviors characteristic of a particular group or organization.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> defined written rules of operations codified in state or federal law.</p>

<p class="ntop">Each nation practices intelligence collection and analysis in ways that are specific to that nation<br class="calibre2" /> alone. This is true even among countries with a common heritage that share much of their intelligence,<br class="calibre2" /> such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The U.S. intelligence</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">Line</span> system is important to understand because it is the largest and most influential in the world&mdash;</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(5)</span> whether considered as an example, a competitor, or a target.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The <span class="italic">intelligence community</span> is made up of agencies and offices whose work is often related and<br class="calibre2" /> sometimes combined, but who serve different needs and clients and work under different lines<br class="calibre2" /> of control and authority. The intelligence community has grown to where and how it is without a<br class="calibre2" /> master plan and as the result of evolving demands over time. It is often considered highly functional,</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(10)</span> but it is sometimes dysfunctional; it provides services that are multiple, varied, and supervised<br class="calibre2" /> by different individuals and organizations, sometimes with different agendas.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">Of the major national powers in the 20th and 21st centuries, the U.S. has the shortest history of<br class="calibre2" /> significant intelligence operations outside of wartime emergencies. British intelligence operations<br class="calibre2" /> date from the reign of Elizabeth I (1558&ndash;1603); French intelligence goes back to the time of Cardinal</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(15)</span> Richelieu (1624&ndash;1642); and Russian intelligence dates back to the reign of Ivan the Terrible<br class="calibre2" /> (1533&ndash;1584). Even considering that the U.S. did not exist until 1776, American intelligence experience<br class="calibre2" /> is still relatively brief: there was no hint of a serious U.S. national intelligence effort until 1940.<br class="calibre2" /> Although some permanent and specific U.S. Army and Navy intelligence units were established<br class="calibre2" /> in the 1800s, the U.S. did not have broader intelligence capabilities until just before World War II.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(20)</span> <span class="pad"></span>Much of the absence of U.S. intelligence efforts before WWII was driven by the fact that the U.S.<br class="calibre2" /> had little interest in what went on outside its borders. The 1823 Monroe Doctrine&mdash;stating that<br class="calibre2" /> the U.S. would resist any European efforts to colonize in the Western Hemisphere&mdash;addressed the<br class="calibre2" /> United States’ perceived basic security and foreign policy needs. The need for better intelligence<br class="calibre2" /> became apparent only after the U.S. became a world power and became involved in international</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(25)</span> issues at the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">Until the Cold War with the Soviet Union started in 1945, the U.S. severely limited spending on<br class="calibre2" /> defense and related activities&mdash;including intelligence&mdash;during peacetime. Even in the 1940s, with<br class="calibre2" /> WWII fully under way, intelligence was seen as a newcomer to the national security arena. Although<br class="calibre2" /> Army and Navy intelligence efforts were well under way by then, they did not become robust until</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(30)</span> well into the 20th century. This meant that national level intelligence did not have any established<br class="calibre2" /> supporters in government&mdash;but it did have rivals in the military services and the Federal Bureau of<br class="calibre2" /> Investigation, neither of whom were keen to share their sources or information. With no firm roots<br class="calibre2" /> of tradition or operational procedures, national intelligence was forced to create both under pressure,<br class="calibre2" /> starting just before WWII, and throughout the Cold War that immediately followed.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(35)</span> <span class="pad"></span>Although the Monroe Doctrine may have contributed somewhat to the lack of a perceived need<br class="calibre2" /> for U.S. national intelligence, it did assume a de facto<span class="italic"></span> U.S. vested interest in the international status<br class="calibre2" /> quo, which became more pronounced after the 1898 Spanish-American War. With the acquisition<br class="calibre2" /> of a small colonial empire, the U.S. achieved a satisfactory international position, largely self-sufficient<br class="calibre2" /> and largely unthreatened. However, the 20th century saw the repeated rise of foreign powers</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(40)</span> whose policies directly threatened the status quo: Germany in WWI, the Axis Powers in WWII, and<br class="calibre2" /> the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Responding to these threats became the mainstay of U.S.<br class="calibre2" /> national security policy and gave focus to much of the operational side of U.S. intelligence efforts.</p>
<p class="ntop-i"><a id="calibre_link-3097" class="calibre3"></a>The terrorism threat in the late 20th and early 21st centuries fits much of the same pattern of an<br class="calibre2" /> adversary who rejects the international status quo. However, the current crop of adversaries are</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(45)</span> not nation-states, although some have either overt or covert support of nation-states. This makes<br class="calibre2" /> dealing with this threat much more challenging, since acceptance of the status quo by terrorists<br class="calibre2" /> removes their stated reason for existence.</p>

<p class="ntop">A professional is a person of character and competence. As military professionals charged with</p>
<p class="ntop">the defense of the nation, joint leaders must be experts in the conduct of war. They must be moral</p>
<p class="ntop">individuals of both action and intellect, skilled at getting things done, while at the same time conversant</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">Line</span> in the military art.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(5)</span> <span class="pad"></span>Every joint leader is expected to be a student of the art and science of war. Officers especially</p>
<p class="ntop">are expected to have a solid foundation in military theory and philosophy, as well as a knowledge</p>
<p class="ntop">of military history and the timeless lessons to be gained from it. Leaders must have a strong sense</p>
<p class="ntop">of the great responsibility of their office; the resources they will expend in war include their fellow</p>
<p class="ntop">citizens.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(10)</span> <span class="pad"></span>Strong character and competence represent the essence of the U.S. joint military force and its</p>
<p class="ntop">leaders. Both are the products of lifelong learning and are embedded in joint professional military</p>
<p class="ntop">education.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">Character is the aggregate of features and traits that form the individual nature of a person. In</p>
<p class="ntop">the context of the profession of arms, it entails moral and ethical adherence to our American values.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(15)</span> Character is at the heart of the relationship of the profession with the American people and</p>
<p class="ntop">with each other.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">Competence is central to the profession of arms. Competent performance includes both the</p>
<p class="ntop">technical competence to perform the relevant task to standard and the ability to demonstrate that</p>
<p class="ntop">skill when working with others. Those who will lead joint operations must develop skill in integrating</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(20)</span> forces into smoothly functioning joint teams.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">U.S. military service is based on values that experience has proven to be vital for operational</p>
<p class="ntop">success. These values adhere to the most idealistic societal norms, are common to all the services,</p>
<p class="ntop">and represent the essence of military professionalism. Duty, honor, courage, integrity, and selfless</p>
<p class="ntop">service are the calling cards of the profession of arms. Integrity, competence, physical courage,</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(25)</span> moral courage, and teamwork all have a special impact on the conduct of joint operations.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">Duty is our foremost value. It binds us together and conveys our moral commitment as defenders</p>
<p class="ntop">of the Constitution and servants of the nation. As members of the profession of arms, we fulfill</p>
<p class="ntop">our duty without consideration of self-interest, sacrificing our lives if needed. From duty comes</p>
<p class="ntop">responsibility.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(30)</span> <span class="pad"></span>Honor is the code of behavior that defines the ethical fulfillment of our duties. It is that quality</p>
<p class="ntop">that guides us to exemplify the ultimate in ethical and moral behavior; never to lie, cheat, or steal;</p>
<p class="ntop">to abide by an uncompromising code of integrity; to respect human dignity; and to have respect</p>
<p class="ntop">and concern for each other. Honor is the quality of maturity, dedication, trust, and dependability</p>
<p class="ntop">that commits members of the profession of arms to act responsibly, to be accountable for their</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(35)</span> actions, to fulfill obligations, and to hold others accountable for their actions.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The United States of America is blessed with Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, Airmen, and Coast</p>
<p class="ntop">Guardsmen whose courage knows no boundaries. Even in warfare characterized by advanced</p>
<p class="ntop">technology, individual fighting spirit and courage remain essential. Courage has both physical and</p>
<p class="ntop">moral aspects and encompasses both bravery and fortitude. Throughout history, physical courage</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(40)</span> has defined warriors. It is the ability to confront physical pain, hardship, death, or the threat</p>
<p class="ntop">of death. Physical courage in a leader is most often expressed in a willingness to act, even alone</p>
<p class="ntop">if necessary, in situations of danger and uncertainty. Moral courage is the ability to act rightly in</p>
<p class="ntop">the face of popular opposition or discouragement, including the willingness to stand up for what</p>
<p class="ntop">one believes to be right even if that stand is unpopular or contrary to conventional wisdom. This</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(45)</span> involves risk-taking, tenacity, and accountability.</p>
<p class="ntop-i"><a id="calibre_link-3099" class="calibre3"></a>Integrity is the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles. Integrity is the</p>
<p class="ntop">bedrock of our character and the cornerstone for building trust. Trust is an essential trait among</p>
<p class="ntop">service members&mdash;trust by seniors in the abilities of their subordinates and by juniors in the</p>
<p class="ntop">competence and support of their seniors. American service members must be able to rely on each</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(50)</span> other, regardless of the challenge at hand; they must individually and collectively say what they</p>
<p class="ntop">mean and do what they say.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">Selfless service epitomizes the quality of putting our nation, our military missions, and others</p>
<p class="ntop">before ourselves. Members of the profession of arms do not serve to pursue fame, position, or</p>
<p class="ntop">money, but rather for the greater good. Selfless service is the enabler of teamwork, the cooperative</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(55)</span> effort by the members of a group to achieve common goals.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">Members of the Armed Forces of the United States must internalize and embody these values.</p>
<p class="ntop">Their adherence to these values helps promulgate an attitude about joint warfighting, producing a</p>
<p class="ntop">synergy that multiplies the effects of their individual actions.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><span class="bold">Reading Passage for Questions 21&ndash;25</span></p>
<p class="ntop">Leadership is the art and science of influencing and directing people to accomplish the assigned</p>
<p class="ntop">mission. This highlights two fundamental elements of leadership: the mission to be accomplished</p>
<p class="ntop">and the people who accomplish it. All facets of Air Force leadership should support these two basic</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">Line</span> elements. Effective leadership transforms human potential into effective performance in the present</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(5)</span> and prepares capable leaders for the future. The Air Force needs these leaders to accomplish</p>
<p class="ntop">the national objectives set for national security, to defend the safety of our people and our nation,</p>
<p class="ntop">when those objectives require the use of armed force.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">Leadership does not equal command, but all commanders should be leaders. Any Air Force</p>
<p class="ntop">member can be a leader and can positively influence those around him or her to accomplish the</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(10)</span> mission. This is the Air Force concept of leadership, and all aspects of Air Force leadership should</p>
<p class="ntop">support it. The vast majority of Air Force leaders are not commanders. These individuals, who have</p>
<p class="ntop">stepped forward to lead others in accomplishing the mission, simultaneously serve as both leaders</p>
<p class="ntop">and followers at every level of the Air Force, from young Airmen working in the life support shop,</p>
<p class="ntop">to captains at wing staffs, to civilians in supply agencies, to generals at the Pentagon. Desirable</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(15)</span> behavioral patterns of these leaders and followers are identified in Air Force doctrine and should</p>
<p class="ntop">be emulated in ways that improve the performance of individuals and units. Leaders positively</p>
<p class="ntop">influence their entire organization without necessarily being the commander.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The primary task of a military organization is to perform its mission. The leader’s primary</p>
<p class="ntop">responsibility is to motivate and direct people to carry out the unit’s mission successfully. A leader</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(20)</span> must never forget the importance of the personnel themselves to that mission.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">People perform the mission. They are the heart of the organization. Without their actions, a unit</p>
<p class="ntop">will fail to achieve its objectives. A leader’s responsibilities include the care, support, and development</p>
<p class="ntop">of the unit’s personnel. Successful leaders have continually ensured that the needs of the</p>
<p class="ntop">people in their unit are met promptly and properly.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(25)</span> <span class="pad"></span>All Air Force leaders share the same goal: to accomplish their organization’s mission. Upon</p>
<p class="ntop">entering the Air Force, members take an oath, signifying their personal commitment to support</p>
<p class="ntop">and defend the Constitution of the United States and a commitment and willingness to serve their</p>
<p class="ntop"><a id="calibre_link-3101" class="calibre3"></a>country for the duration of their Air Force careers. The oath is a solemn promise to do one’s duty</p>
<p class="ntop">and meet one’s responsibilities. The oath espouses the responsibility to lead others in the exercise</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(30)</span> of one’s duty.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">Regardless of duty location, occupational specialty, or job position, all Airmen must embody the</p>
<p class="ntop">warrior ethos, tough-mindedness, tireless motivation, an unceasing vigilance, and a willingness to</p>
<p class="ntop">sacrifice their own lives for their country, if necessary. Air Force Airmen, military and civilian, are</p>
<p class="ntop">committed to being the world’s premier air and space force. This is the warrior ethos.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(35)</span> <span class="pad"></span>The abilities of a leader, which are derived from innate capabilities and built through experience,</p>
<p class="ntop">education, and training, can be improved upon through deliberate development. Using the</p>
<p class="ntop">Air Force leadership components is the means by which Airmen can achieve excellence&mdash;by living</p>
<p class="ntop">the Air Force core values, developing enduring leadership competencies, acquiring professional</p>
<p class="ntop">and technical competence, and then acting on such abilities to accomplish the unit’s mission</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(40)</span> while taking care of the unit’s personnel. Core values permeate leadership at all levels at all times.</p>
<p class="ntop">Leaders at the more junior levels must demonstrate the personal leadership competencies needed</p>
<p class="ntop">to create a cohesive unit fully supportive of its mission. Mid-level leaders will use the people and</p>
<p class="ntop">team leadership competencies to advance the organization’s responsibilities within the framework</p>
<p class="ntop">of the operational mission. The more senior the leader, the more crucial his or her influence is on</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(45)</span> the institutional excellence of the organization. The abilities to influence people, improve performance,</p>
<p class="ntop">and accomplish a mission&mdash;the leadership actions&mdash;are part of all levels of leadership.</p>

<p class="noindent1">The Self-Description Inventory measures personal characteristics and traits. The inventory consists of a list of 240 statements; your task is to read each statement carefully and decide how much that statement applies to you. You will then indicate how much you agree that a particular statement applies to you or describes you by using the following scale:</p>
<p class="qn-alpha1"><span class="alp">(A)</span> Strongly disagree</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> Moderately disagree</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> Neither agree nor disagree</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> Moderately agree</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> Strongly agree</p>
<p class="noindent1">Since you have 240 statements and only 45 minutes for this test, you should work quickly&mdash;but you should answer all the questions. Choose your answer from your first impression by comparing yourself with other people in your same age group and of the same sex. Don’t spend a long time thinking about what the “right” answer is&mdash;there is no right or wrong answer to any question. Mark a choice for all the statements, even if you’re not completely sure of the answer. Again, your first impression will be the best indicator.</p>

<p class="head"><span class="bold">25 Questions</span></p>
<div class="dbox">
<p class="bnoindent"><small class="sc"><span class="bold">DIRECTIONS:</span></small> <span class="gotham-medium">This subtest measures your ability to determine the position of an airplane in flight from reading instruments showing its compass heading (direction), amount of climb or dive, and degree of bank to the right or left. In each problem, the left-hand dial is labeled ARTIFICIAL HORIZON. On the face of the dial, the small aircraft fuselage silhouette remains stationary, whereas the positions of the white line and the white pointer vary with changes in the position of the aircraft in which the instrument is located.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">The white line represents the HORIZON LINE. The white pointer shows the degree of BANK to the right or left.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane is neither climbing nor diving, the horizon line is directly on the fuselage silhouette, as in dial 1 below.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00246.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre35" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane has no bank, the white pointer is seen to point to zero, as in dial 1 above.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane is climbing, the fuselage silhouette is seen between the horizon line and the pointer, as shown in dial 2 below. The greater the amount of climb, the greater the distance between the horizon line and the fuselage silhouette.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00268.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre35" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane is banked to the pilot’s left, the pointer is seen to the right of zero, as in dial 2 above.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane is diving, the horizon line is seen between the fuselage silhouette and the pointer, as shown in dial 3 below. The greater the amount of dive, the greater the distance between the horizon line and the fuselage silhouette.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00287.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre35" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane is banked to the pilot’s right, the pointer is seen to the left of zero, as in dial 3 above.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="calibre_link-3124" class="calibre3"></a>The HORIZON LINE tilts as the aircraft is banked and is always at right angles to the pointer.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Dial 1 shows an airplane neither climbing nor diving, with no bank.</p>
<p class="noindent">Dial 2 shows an airplane climbing and banked 45° to the pilot’s right.</p>
<p class="noindent">Dial 3 shows an airplane diving and banked 45° to the pilot’s left.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In each problem, the right-hand dial is labeled COMPASS. On this dial, the nose of the plane shows the compass direction in which the airplane is headed. Dial 4 shows the airplane headed north, dial 5 shows it headed west, and dial 6 shows it headed northwest.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00309.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre31" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">Each problem consists of two dials and four silhouettes of airplanes in flight. Your task is to determine which one of the four airplanes is MOST NEARLY in the position indicated by the two dials. You are always looking north at the same altitude in each of the four airplanes’ silhouettes. East is always to your right as you look at the page. In the sample question below, the dial labeled ARTIFICIAL HORIZON shows that the airplane is NOT banked, and is neither climbing nor diving. The COMPASS shows that it is headed south. The only one of the four airplane silhouettes that meets these specifications is in the box lettered (A), so the answer to the sample question is (A).</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Reading Passage for Questions 1&ndash;5</span></p>
<p class="ntopn">The State Partnership Program (SPP) is a joint Department of Defense (DoD) security cooperation <br class="calibre2" />program, managed and administered by the National Guard Bureau, executed and coordinated by<br class="calibre2" /> the geographic combatant commands, with personnel provided by the Air and Army National Guard.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">Line</span> It is an innovative, small-footprint tool that supports the security cooperation goals of the geographic</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(5)</span> combatant commanders and the U.S. Chief of Mission for the respective partner nation involved.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The SPP has built enduring relationships for more than 23 years that, as of the end of Fiscal Year<br class="calibre2" /> (FY) 2016, included 70 partnerships with 76 countries spread across all six geographic combatant<br class="calibre2" /> commands. By the end of FY 2016, three new partnerships had received initial approval from the<br class="calibre2" /> Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, as well as Department of State concurrence,</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(10)</span> but designation of partner states by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau and final approval by<br class="calibre2" /> the DoD had not yet been completed.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">All 54 U.S. states and territories with National Guard elements have at least one SPP partnership.<br class="calibre2" /> Over the course of more than two decades, the SPP has evolved to meet the changing requirements<br class="calibre2" /> of the DoD’s security cooperation efforts. From helping to reform Eastern Europe’s military</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(15)</span> establishments after the Cold War to helping partner nations participate in coalition operations <br class="calibre2" />and improve their disaster response capabilities, the SPP’s enduring relationships have provided<br class="calibre2" /> uniquely valuable support in the accomplishment of geographic combatant commanders’ security<br class="calibre2" /> cooperation goals. The National Guard remains committed to maintaining the enduring relationships<br class="calibre2" /> that the SPP provides to help ensure U.S. strategic access, sustain and increase U.S. presence</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(20)</span> and influence, and enhance partner nation defense, security force, and disaster response capabilities<br class="calibre2" /> in support of regional U.S. goals.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The SPP builds cumulative benefits for both the United States and the partner nation over time<br class="calibre2" /> through recurring individual, professional, and institutional contacts and relationships. These benefits<br class="calibre2" /> go beyond just enhanced influence and access for the United States&mdash;they generate trust, the essential</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(25)</span> ingredient for successful operations when times are tough or when changes need to be made.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The invaluable trust engendered by enduring SPP relationships has, over the 23-year course of<br class="calibre2" /> the program so far, resulted in a total of 38 partner nations who have deployed personnel in<br class="calibre2" /> support of Operations Iraqi Freedom, Inherent Resolve, and Enduring Freedom, or the North Atlantic<br class="calibre2" /> Treaty Organization (NATO)-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Of</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(30)</span> those, 16 partner nations made co-deployment with personnel from their partner state a condition<br class="calibre2" /> of their deployment in support of coalition operations, and 17 partner nations deployed forces to<br class="calibre2" /> both Iraq and Afghanistan. Further, a total of 52 SPP partner nations&mdash;approximately three-quarters<br class="calibre2" /> of the total&mdash;are contributing to or have contributed to United Nations peacekeeping missions<br class="calibre2" /> around the world. These additional faces and forces not only demonstrate international support</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(35)</span> for multinational action in areas affected by international tensions and natural disasters, but they<br class="calibre2" /> also reduce the amount of U.S. forces needed in those same areas.</p>

<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> justification for funding the SPP in FY 2016.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> an overview of how the SPP got started.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> an overview of the SPP as a program at the end of FY 2016.</p>

<p class="ques"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-1435" href="#calibre_link-106" class="calibre3">3</a>.</span> You can infer from the passage that</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> the SPP has lost many of its original members.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> the benefits that the U.S. receives due to the SPP go beyond just monetary measurements.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> the SPP is primarily a program to benefit warfighting efforts.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> the relationships between SPP participants are strictly professional.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> the SPP requires a great deal of attention from both the DoD and the geographic combatant commanders.</p>
<p class="ques"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-1436" href="#calibre_link-107" class="calibre3">4</a>.</span> As used throughout the passage, the term “partner nation” means</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> a foreign country partnered with the National Guard of a U.S. state or territory.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> a foreign country with treaty obligations to the U.S.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> the nation where a major U.S. exercise is held.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> opponents to coalition activities.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> a country that shares identical goals with the U.S.</p>
<p class="ques"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-1437" href="#calibre_link-108" class="calibre3">5</a>.</span> With which statement would the author of this passage most likely agree?</p>

<p class="ntopn">The United States relies on the Internet and the systems and data of cyberspace for a wide range of<br class="calibre2" /> critical services. The Internet connects billions of people, helps deliver goods and services globally,<br class="calibre2" /> and brings ideas and knowledge to those who would otherwise lack access. The United States’ reliance</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">Line</span> on cyberspace leaves us vulnerable in the face of a real and dangerous cyber threat, as state</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(5)</span> and non-state actors plan to conduct disruptive and destructive cyberattacks on the networks of<br class="calibre2" /> our critical infrastructure and steal U.S. intellectual property to undercut our technological and<br class="calibre2" /> military advantage.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The DoD cyber strategy guides the development of its cyber forces to strengthen its cyber defense and cyber<br class="calibre2" /> deterrence posture. The DoD’s policy focuses on building cyber capabilities and</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(10)</span> organizations for its three cyber missions: defending DoD networks, systems, and information;<br class="calibre2" /> defending the United States and its interests against cyberattacks of significant consequence; and<br class="calibre2" /> providing integrated cyber capabilities to support military operations and contingency plans. The<br class="calibre2" /> strategy sets five strategic goals and establishes specific objectives for the DoD to achieve over the <br class="calibre2" />next five years and beyond.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(15)</span> <span class="pad"></span>Today’s cyberspace environment, including the increasing severity and sophistication of the<br class="calibre2" /> cyber threat to U.S. interests, requires the DoD to maintain an updated strategy. The DoD has the<br class="calibre2" /> largest network in the world, and it must take aggressive steps to defend its networks, secure its<br class="calibre2" /> data, and mitigate risks to DoD missions. In 2012, the president directed the DoD to organize and<br class="calibre2" /> plan to defend the nation against cyberattacks of significant consequence in concert with other</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(20)</span> U.S. government agencies, and the DoD soon began to build a Cyber Mission Force (CMF) to carry<br class="calibre2" /> out its cyber missions.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">To build the force of the future, the DoD must attract the best talent, the best ideas, and the<br class="calibre2" /> best technology to public service. To do so, the DoD is building strong bridges to the private sector<br class="calibre2" /> as well as to the research institutions that make the United States such an innovative nation. The</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(25)</span> private sector and America’s research institutions design and build the networks of cyberspace,<br class="calibre2" /> provide cybersecurity services, and research and develop advanced capabilities. The DoD continues<br class="calibre2" /> its strong historic partnerships with the private sector and these research institutions, and it<br class="calibre2" /> will strengthen those ties to discover and validate new ideas for cybersecurity for the DoD and for<br class="calibre2" /> the country as a whole.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(30)</span> <span class="pad"></span>Deterrence is a key part of the DoD’s cyber strategy. Deterrence of cyberattacks on U.S. interests<br class="calibre2" /> will be achieved through the totality of U.S. actions, including stated policy, substantial indications<br class="calibre2" /> and warning capabilities, defensive posture, effective response procedures, and the overall<br class="calibre2" /> resiliency of U.S. networks and systems. The DoD is building and maintaining ready forces and<br class="calibre2" /> capabilities to conduct cyberspace operations to defend the DoD Information Network (DoDIN),</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(35)</span> secure DoD data, and mitigate risks to DoD missions. The DoD will defend the U.S. homeland and<br class="calibre2" /> our vital interests from significant disruptive or destructive cyberattacks. The DoD is building and<br class="calibre2" /> maintaining viable cyber options and planning the use of those options to control conflict escalation<br class="calibre2" /> and shape the conflict environment at all stages. It is also building and maintaining robust<br class="calibre2" /> international alliances and partnerships to deter shared threats and increase international security</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(40)</span> and stability.</p>

<p class="ntopn">The Air Force core values are a statement of the institutional values and principles of conduct that<br class="calibre2" /> provide the moral framework for military activities. The professional Air Force ethic consists of<br class="calibre2" /> three fundamental and enduring values: <span class="italic">integrity first</span>, <span class="italic">service before self</span>, and <span class="italic">excellence in all we</span></p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">Line</span> <span class="italic">do</span>. This ethic is the set of values that guide the way Airmen live and perform. Success hinges on</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(5)</span> the incorporation of these values into the character of every Airman. In today’s time-compressed,<br class="calibre2" /> dynamic, and dangerous operational environment, an Airman does not have the luxury of examining<br class="calibre2" /> each issue at leisure. He or she must fully internalize these values in order to be better prepared<br class="calibre2" /> in all situations&mdash;to maintain integrity, to serve others before self, to perform with excellence, and<br class="calibre2" /> to encourage others to do the same. The Air Force core values are a commitment that each Airman</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(10)</span> makes when joining the Air Force. These values provide a foundation for leadership, decision-making,<br class="calibre2" /> and success, no matter the level of an Airman’s assignment, the difficulty of the task at<br class="calibre2" /> hand, or the dangers presented by the mission.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">There are four reasons why the Air Force recognizes these core values as fundamental to its<br class="calibre2" /> people:</p>
<p class="ntopb"><span class="hgib">(15) <span class="apad"></span>•</span> The core values identify the attributes all Airmen should have. All Air Force personnel must<br class="calibre2" /> possess integrity first. A person’s “self” must take a back seat to Air Force service: rules must<br class="calibre2" /> be acknowledged and followed faithfully; other personnel must be respected as persons of<br class="calibre2" /> fundamental worth; discipline and self-control must be demonstrated always; and there<br class="calibre2" /> must be faith in the system. The Air Force demands that each of us place service before self.</p>
<p class="ntopb"><span class="hgib">(20)</span> It is imperative that we seek excellence in all we do&mdash;whether the form is product or service<br class="calibre2" /> excellence, resources excellence, community excellence, or operations excellence.</p>
<p class="indent-slist">• The core values point to what is universal and unchanging in the profession of arms. The<br class="calibre2" /> values are road signs that invite us to consider key features of the requirements of professional<br class="calibre2" /> service, but they cannot hope to point to or pick out everything. By examining integrity,</p>
<p class="ntopb"><span class="hgib">(25)</span> service, and excellence, we also eventually discover the importance of duty, honor, country,<br class="calibre2" /> dedication, fidelity, competence, and a host of other professional requirements and attributes.</p>
<p class="indent-slist">• They help us get a fix on the ethical climate of an organization. Big-ticket scandals grow<br class="calibre2" /> out of a climate of ethical erosion. Because some believe our operating procedures or the<br class="calibre2" /> requirements levied upon them from above are absurd, they tend to “cut corners” or “skate</p>
<p class="ntopb"><span class="hgib">(30)</span> by.” As time goes by, these actions become easier, and they become habitual until the<br class="calibre2" /> person can no longer distinguish between the “important” tasking or rules and the “stupid”<br class="calibre2" /> ones. Lying on official forms becomes second nature. Placing personal interests ahead of<br class="calibre2" /> the mission becomes a natural response. These individuals then develop a “good enough<br class="calibre2" /> for government work” mentality. In such a climate of corrosion, the core values can bring a</p>
<p class="ntopb"><span class="hgib">(35)</span> person back to recognition of what is important: integrity, service, and excellence.</p>
<p class="indent-slist">• They serve as beacons vectoring us back to the path of professional conduct. Adherence to the<br class="calibre2" /> core values ensures that the Air Force will not degrade from a climate of ethical commitment<br class="calibre2" /> into a climate of corrosion.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The Air Force recognizes these core values as universal and unchanging in the profession of</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(40)</span> arms. They provide the standards with which to evaluate the ethical climate of all Air Force organizations.<br class="calibre2" /> Finally, when needed in the cauldron of war, they are the beacons vectoring the individual<br class="calibre2" /> back to the path of professional conduct and the highest ideals of integrity, service, and excellence.</p>

<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> these core values have not always been universally applied.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> these core values have historically been consistently applied.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> other, more detailed, standards and requirements are not needed if these values are observed and applied.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> standards and requirements for ethical conduct change over time, even if slowly.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> these core values only apply to peacetime service, not to the stresses of combat operations.</p>
<p class="ques1"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-1444" href="#calibre_link-115" class="calibre3">12</a>.</span> The primary purpose of this passage is to</p>

<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> articulate how the values and standards that derive from these core values support specific standards and requirements.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> provide an overview of Air Force core values and explain why they are important.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> explain why balancing the core values is important as situations change over time.</p>
<p class="ques1"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-1445" href="#calibre_link-116" class="calibre3">13</a>.</span> In the fourth bullet point and in the last paragraph, the word “vectoring” most nearly means</p>

<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> is a function of balancing these core values against operational requirements as situations change and evolve.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> is the product of enlightened leadership, superior technology, and correct application of doctrine.</p>

<p class="ntopn">In the 23 months of its World War II existence, the 15th Air Force&mdash;operating mostly from a complex</p>
<p class="ntop">of airfields in southern Italy previously used by Axis forces&mdash;destroyed all gasoline production</p>
<p class="ntop">within range in southern Europe; knocked out all the major aircraft factories in its area of operations;</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">Line</span> and destroyed 6,282 enemy aircraft in the air or on the ground.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(5)</span> <span class="pad"></span>The 15th Air Force crippled the Axis transportation system throughout half of occupied Europe</p>
<p class="ntop">with repeated fighter and bomber attacks, sometimes also helping to disperse enemy counterattacks</p>
<p class="ntop">or paving the way for advancing Allied land forces. The 15th Air Force dropped 303,842 tons</p>
<p class="ntop">of bombs on enemy targets in nine countries across Europe, including military installations in</p>
<p class="ntop">eight capital cities. Its combat personnel made 148,955 heavy bomber sorties and 87,732 fighter</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(10)</span>sorties against the enemy. It lost 3,364 aircraft and 21,617 personnel killed, wounded, missing, or</p>
<p class="ntop">taken prisoner&mdash;20,430 bomber crewmen and 1,187 fighter pilots.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The 15th Air Force’s overall mission was to attack enemy oil facilities, air forces, communications,</p>
<p class="ntop">and ground forces. Most vital of the 15th Air Force’s oil-related targets was the complex of</p>
<p class="ntop">refineries in Ploesti, Romania, which contributed almost a third of the entire Axis oil and gasoline</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(15)</span> supply. Ploesti was protected by three German and Romanian fighter groups, as well as by hundreds</p>
<p class="ntop">of well-concealed and well-integrated heavy and medium caliber antiaircraft guns, when the</p>
<p class="ntop">15th Air Force, along with the night bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) 205th Group, conducted</p>
<p class="ntop">a series of attacks from April 5 to August 19, 1944. The 15th Air Force and RAF bombers flew 5,287</p>
<p class="ntop">sorties, dropping 12,870 tons of bombs. The cost was 237 Allied heavy bombers (15 of them RAF),</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(20)</span> 10 dive bombers, and 39 escort fighters. More than 2,200 American Airmen were lost, but the</p>
<p class="ntop">campaign reduced the Axis refineries’ production to only 10 percent of previous levels. The 15th</p>
<p class="ntop">Air Force followed up the Ploesti attacks by dropping 10,000 tons of bombs on three synthetic oil</p>
<p class="ntop">plants in Silesia and one in Poland. By February 1945, the 15th Air Force’s attacks reduced these</p>
<p class="ntop">plants’ combined production to 20 percent of what it had been eight months before.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(25)</span> <span class="pad"></span>The 15th Air Force also contributed significantly to Allied air supremacy in Europe by conducting</p>
<p class="ntop">devastating attacks on German fighter manufacturing complexes in Wiener Neustadt and</p>
<p class="ntop">Regensburg. By May 1944, these facilities were only producing about 250 aircraft a month instead</p>
<p class="ntop">of the Axis’ planned production of 650 aircraft a month. Even during the campaigns against enemy</p>
<p class="ntop">oil facilities and air forces, the 15th Air Force was also attacking enemy communications and</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(30)</span> transportation systems far behind the front lines, disrupting supply movement from Axis industrial</p>
<p class="ntop">centers within an 800-mile radius of the 15th Air Force’s Italian airfields.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The 15th Air Force also supported ground operations in Italy, bombing Axis targets at Salerno,</p>
<p class="ntop">Anzio, and Cassino during the Rome campaign. On April 15, 1945, the 15th Air Force put up a</p>
<p class="ntop">record-breaking 93 percent of its available aircraft to soften up the approaches to Bologna in one</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(35)</span> of the final missions of the Italian campaign.</p>
<p class="ntop">A unique aspect of the 15th Air Force’s operations was the rescue and repatriation of aircrews</p>
<p class="ntop">shot down in enemy territory. No other air force conducted escape operations in so many countries.</p>
<p class="ntop">The 15th Air Force returned 5,650 personnel by air, surface vessel, or on foot through enemy</p>
<p class="ntop">lines. In more than 300 “reunion” operations, the 15th Air Force brought Airmen safely back from</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(40)</span> Tunisia, Italy, France, Switzerland, Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Austria,</p>

<p class="ntopn">More than 1,100 U.S. institutions of higher learning offer military precommissioning training in</p>
<p class="ntop">Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs under Title 10, U.S. Code. Six of those schools are</p>
<p class="ntop">designated in law as Senior Military Colleges (SMCs):</p>
<p class="ntopb"><span class="hgib">Line <span class="apad"></span>•</span> Norwich University, Northfield, VT (1813)</p>
<p class="ntopb"><span class="hgib">(5) <span class="apad"></span>•</span> The Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, VA (1839)</p>
<p class="indent-slist">• The Citadel, Charleston, SC (1842)</p>
<p class="indent-slist">• The University of North Georgia (formerly North Georgia College), Dahlonega, GA (1873)</p>
<p class="indent-slist">• The Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (commonly known as Virginia Tech),<br class="calibre2" />Blacksburg, VA (1872)</p>
<p class="ntopb"><span class="hgib">(10) <span class="apad"></span>•</span> Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, TX (1876)</p>
<p class="ntop-i">SMCs differ from other colleges and universities in that they have a “full-time” uniformed</p>
<p class="ntop">Corps of Cadets with its own identity outside the ROTC programs. This provides a daily military</p>
<p class="ntop">environment in which the cadets are subject to military discipline. SMC cadets do not incur a</p>
<p class="ntop">military obligation by membership in their school’s Corps of Cadets, but SMC ROTC graduates</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(15)</span> are guaranteed an active duty commission if desired upon graduation. Additionally, the Defense</p>
<p class="ntop">Department can, without notice, close, reduce, or suspend regular ROTC programs during a total</p>
<p class="ntop">mobilization to make the cadre available for assignment elsewhere&mdash;but not so for the SMCs.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">All six SMCs started as military colleges or academies, but now all but one (VMI) allow civilian</p>
<p class="ntop">students, too. Five of the six SMCs (all but the University of North Georgia) offer Army, Air Force,</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(20)</span> and Navy/Marine ROTC&mdash;and average Corps of Cadets membership at both Texas A&amp;M and The</p>
<p class="ntop">Citadel usually exceeds 2,000, making them the nation’s largest cadet organizations outside the</p>
<p class="ntop">federal service academies. One SMC is a private school (Norwich), while the other five are state=supported.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">However, despite their differences, all six SMCs share a dedication to academic excellence&mdash;</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(25)</span> perhaps because of their military-driven focus on mission accomplishment, adherence to</p>
<p class="ntop">standards, and the highest levels of professional and personal conduct. The five public SMCs are</p>
<p class="ntop">all ranked in the 25 “Top Public Schools” nationwide, and all are ranked in the top 100 schools</p>
<p class="ntop">nationally or in their region. Four are ranked in the top 30 nationally for their undergraduate</p>
<p class="ntop">engineering programs, and three are ranked in the top 25 for best value by two major publications.</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(30)</span> <span class="pad"></span>The SMCs’ traditions of excellence and dedication to service are well demonstrated by the</p>
<p class="ntop">accomplishments of their alumni, many of whom did not graduate because military service got</p>
<p class="ntop">in the way&mdash;sometimes permanently. Especially at the outbreak of World War I and World War II,</p>
<p class="ntop">many SMC students resigned to enlist immediately; some did not return.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The Citadel lists 289 general or flag officers among its former students, including five four-star</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(35)</span> and 32 three-star officers. Eleven Medal of Honor recipients were Citadel alumni.</p>
<p class="ntop">There are 138 Norwich University graduates who have served as U.S. general or flag officers,</p>
<p class="ntop">plus another 26 graduates who served as generals in foreign armies. Eight Norwich alumni have</p>
<p class="ntop">received the Medal of Honor.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">During World War II, more than 14,000 Texas A&amp;M alumni (“Aggies”) served as officers&mdash;more</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(40)</span> than the U.S. Military and Naval academies combined, and more than three times the contribution</p>
<p class="ntop">of any other SMC. Since its founding, some 269 Texas A&amp;M alumni have achieved flag rank,</p>
<p class="ntop">including nine four-stars and 31 three-stars. Eight Aggies have been awarded the Medal of Honor.</p>
<p class="ntop-i">The University of North Georgia lists 54 general or flag officers (admirals) among their alumni,</p>
<p class="ntop">including two four-stars, seven three-stars, and one Medal of Honor recipient.</p>
<p class="ntop"><a id="calibre_link-3167" class="calibre3"></a><span class="hgi">(45)</span> <span class="pad"></span>Seven VMI alumni have received the Medal of Honor, and 266 have served as U.S. generals or</p>
<p class="ntop">admirals&mdash;in fact, VMI is the only U.S. military college whose graduates include the top four-star</p>
<p class="ntop">generals of three services: two Marine Corps Commandants, a Chief of Staff of the Army, and a</p>
<p class="ntop">Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Another 16 alumni have gone on to flag rank in foreign militaries.</p>
<p class="ntop">Virginia Tech alumni rolls include seven Medal of Honor recipients and 97 general officers and</p>
<p class="ntop"><span class="hgi">(50)</span> admirals, including three four-star and 11 three-star officers. The class with the greatest number</p>
<p class="ntop">of flag officers was the Class of 1941.</p>

The inventory consists of a list of 240 statements; your task is to read each statement carefully and decide how much that statement applies to you. You will then indicate how much you agree that a particular statement applies to you or describes you by using the following scale:</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> Strongly disagree</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> Moderately disagree</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> Neither agree nor disagree</p>

<p class="h4"><span class="bold">25 Questions</span></p>
<div class="dbox">
<p class="box_noindent"><small class="sc"><span class="bold">DIRECTIONS:</span></small> This subtest measures your ability to determine the position of an airplane in flight from reading instruments showing its compass heading (direction), amount of climb or dive, and degree of bank to the right or left. In each problem, the left-hand dial is labeled ARTIFICIAL HORIZON. On the face of the dial, the small aircraft fuselage silhouette remains stationary, whereas the positions of the white line and the white pointer vary with changes in the position of the aircraft in which the instrument is located.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">The white line represents the HORIZON LINE. The white pointer shows the degree of BANK to the right or left.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane is neither climbing nor diving, the horizon line is directly on the fuselage silhouette, as in dial 1 below.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00410.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw3" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane has no bank, the white pointer is seen to point to zero, as in dial 1 above.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane is climbing, the fuselage silhouette is seen between the horizon line and the pointer, as shown in dial 2 below. The greater the amount of climb, the greater the distance between the horizon line and the fuselage silhouette.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00428.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw3" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane is banked to the pilot’s left, the pointer is seen to the right of zero, as in dial 2 above.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane is diving, the horizon line is seen between the fuselage silhouette and the pointer, as shown in dial 3 below. The greater the amount of dive, the greater the distance between the horizon line and the fuselage silhouette.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00455.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw3" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">If the airplane is banked to the pilot’s right, the pointer is seen to the left of zero, as in dial 3 above.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="calibre_link-3191" class="calibre3"></a>The HORIZON LINE tilts as the aircraft is banked and is always at right angles to the pointer.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Dial 1 shows an airplane neither climbing nor diving, with no bank.</p>
<p class="noindent">Dial 2 shows an airplane climbing and banked 45° to the pilot’s right.</p>
<p class="noindent">Dial 3 shows an airplane diving and banked 45° to the pilot’s left.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In each problem, the right-hand dial is labeled COMPASS. On this dial, the nose of the plane shows the compass direction in which the airplane is headed. Dial 4 shows the airplane headed north, dial 5 shows it headed west, and dial 6 shows it headed northwest.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00469.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre41" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Each problem consists of two dials and four silhouettes of airplanes in flight. Your task is to determine which one of the four airplanes is MOST NEARLY in the position indicated by the two dials. You are always looking north at the same altitude in each of the four airplanes’ silhouettes. East is always to your right as you look at the page. In the sample question below, the dial labeled ARTIFICIAL HORIZON shows that the airplane is NOT banked, and is neither climbing nor diving. The COMPASS shows that it is headed south. The only one of the four airplane silhouettes that meets these specifications is in the box lettered (A), so the answer to the sample question is (A).</p>

<p class="h" id="calibre_link-2456"><a href="#calibre_link-267" class="calibre5">TEST FORMAT</a></p>
<p class="noindent">The Army’s SIFT is completely automated; there is no paper version, so you don’t have to worry about whether you filled in the little bubble on the answer sheet correctly to get credit for your answer.</p>
<p class="indent">As a reminder, this is how the SIFT is organized:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00940.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre37" /></p>
<p class="indent">Again, the subtests are different, so there are different strategies and techniques needed to do your best.</p>
<p class="h1">Subtest 1: Simple Drawings (SD)</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the Simple Drawings subtest, you will be given five shapes, four of which are identical and one of which is different. Your task is to identify the letter of the shape that’s different and move on quickly&mdash;there are 100 questions and only two minutes&mdash;but don’t guess! The SD score is a result of how many questions you get right, and wrong answers are deducted from your score. It’s unlikely that you’ll be able to get through all the questions in the time allotted, so concentrate on choosing the right answer for the ones you do answer&mdash;and don’t start randomly guessing as time is about to expire.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s an example question:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00014.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre23" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">As you can see, choice (D) is different because it’s not filled in, so that would be your choice.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-3210" class="calibre5"></a>Subtest 2: Hidden Figures (HF)</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Hidden Figures subtest measures your ability to “see” and identify a simple figure hidden within a complex drawing. You will be given a series of five lettered figures, followed by five numbered drawings. Your objective is to determine which lettered figure is contained within each numbered drawing.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, like the Simple Drawings subtest, work quickly and don’t guess&mdash;you have 50 questions and only five minutes allotted, but once you get rolling they will come easier. Remember, though, that you get your HF score from how many problems you get right; wrong answers are deducted from your score&mdash;so concentrate on making the right choice, and don’t start randomly guessing as time is about to expire.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00031.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre23" /></p>

<p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-3212" class="calibre5"></a>Subtest 3: Army Aviation Information Test (AAIT)</p>
<p class="noindent1">This subtest assesses your level of knowledge of the basics of rotary-wing flight, as well as terminology and concepts relevant to Army aviation. You will have 40 multiple-choice questions to answer in 30 minutes. This subtest has a fixed number of questions and is not adaptive. Unlike the first two subtests, any unanswered questions will be graded as incorrect. Therefore, if time is about to expire, you will benefit by taking just enough time on the remaining questions to bypass obviously wrong answer choices and make educated guesses.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="ques1"><span class="alp">P3.</span> You are in a helicopter in straight and level flight with a constant power setting. When the helicopter’s nose is pulled up, the altitude will</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> remain the same.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> initially increase.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> initially decrease.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> increase continuously.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> decrease continuously.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The correct answer is choice (B)&mdash;the helicopter’s momentum will result in an initial increase in altitude, even if engine RPMs are not increased.</p>
<p class="h1">Subtest 4: Spatial Apperception Test (SAT)</p>
<p class="noindent1">The SAT measures your ability to determine the position of an aircraft in flight relative to the view the pilot would see looking forward out of the cockpit. In this view, you will usually have some land, water, and clouds. The land is shaded lightly, and the water is darker. The clouds will help you determine the general line of the horizon, since the bottom of the clouds will be parallel to the horizon.The SAT has 25 questions, which you will have 10 minutes to answer. Your task is to determine whether the aircraft is banking, diving, climbing, or in level flight&mdash;then you must choose the one illustration from a series of five that best represents how that same aircraft would look when viewed from the outside.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="ques1"><span class="alp">P4.</span></p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00292.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre23" /></p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="calibre_link-3213" class="calibre3"></a>The correct answer is choice (D). Since the horizon is tilted to the right, you (as the pilot) are banking to the left; since the horizon is roughly in the middle of the view, you are in level flight; the water is on your left and the land on the right, with your path of forward progress leading generally along the coast. The only answer choice that matches all these conditions is choice (D).</p>
<p class="h1">Subtest 5: Reading Comprehension Test (RCT)</p>
<p class="noindent1">The RCT measures your vocabulary and reading skills. It consists of 20 multiple-choice questions, which you will have 30 minutes to answer. Again, it is not adaptive, so if time is getting short, try to blaze through the last few questions, since unanswered questions will be counted as incorrect.</p>
<p class="indent">Read the passage associated with each question carefully, then choose the response that best answers the question based on the passage.</p>
<p class="ext">A noted communications researcher found that only 7 percent of our feelings and attitudes are communicated with words, 38 percent through tone of voice, and a whopping 55 percent through nonverbal expressions and body language. These numbers are astonishing, but that’s only part of the picture. The communications channels that we best control and best understand have the least impact&mdash;and the channels over which we have the least control, and that we understand the least, are by far the most important.</p>
<p class="ques1"><span class="alp">P5.</span> According to the above passage,</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> 55 percent of what we say is understood through tone of voice.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> verbal communication is what gets the message across.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> we have the most control over the most important aspects of how we communicate.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> written communication is more precise than verbal communication.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> more than half of our communication is through nonverbal expressions and body language.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The correct answer is choice (E); even though choice (D) may be true, too, the passage does not address whether written communication is more precise than verbal communication.</p>
<p class="h1">Subtest 6: Math Skills Test (MST)</p>
<p class="noindent1">The MST is one of two adaptive subtests on the SIFT; it evaluates your knowledge of basic arithmetic and your problem-solving ability using math. Although you can expect to see 20&ndash;30 questions on this subtest, you may see more or less depending on how you do, as the program tailors its questions to your demonstrated level of proficiency.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-3214" class="calibre3"></a>Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="ques1"><span class="alp">P6.</span> Mrs. H.B. drove her Volvo S70 four-door sedan from Waco to Corpus Christi at an average speed of 68 miles per hour, including two rest stops of 10 minutes each. Her car, on average, gets highway mileage of 30 miles per gallon. If her car used 9.5 gallons of gas, how many hours did she travel?</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> 4 hrs., 45 min.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> 3 hrs., 30 min.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> 4 hrs., 12 min.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> 4 hrs., 2 min.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> none of the above</p>
<p class="noindent1">The answer is choice (C), 4.2 hours (4 hours, 12 minutes). Although we are given lots of numbers and information in the problem (car model, city names, how long her rest stops were), some of it is not relevant. To solve this problem:</p>
<p class="eqn">9.5 gallons of gas <span class="entity">×</span> 30 miles per gallon = 285 miles traveled<br class="calibre2" />285 miles ÷ 68 mph = 4.2 hrs. (4 hrs., 12 min.)</p>
<p class="noindent1">Again, since this subtest is adaptive, it is not wise to guess, even if time is about to run out.</p>
<p class="h1">Subtest 7: Mechanical Comprehension Test (MCT)</p>
<p class="noindent1">This subtest&mdash;one of two adaptive subtests on the SIFT&mdash;measures your understanding of general mechanical principles by (in most cases) showing you a diagram and asking you a question about the mechanical principle(s) illustrated there.</p>
<p class="indent">You can expect to see about 20 questions in the 15 minutes you have allotted, although since the MCT is adaptive, you may see more or less depending on your demonstrated knowledge in this area.</p>
<p class="ques1"><span class="alp">P7.</span> At which point should one pull down to raise the weight more easily: at point A or at point B?</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/00311.jpeg" alt="image" class="zw" /></p>
<p class="indentt">The correct answer is point B. Pulling down at point B makes more leverage available because of the longer length of the lever. (The distance from the fulcrum&mdash;the point of attachment to the hanging chain&mdash;is farther to point B than to point A, resulting in a longer effective lever length, and hence requiring less force to raise the weight at B than at A.)</p>

Mark Clark, landed south of Salerno at 0330 hours on September 9, 1943. Within Fifth Army, the U.S. VI Corps landed south of the Sele River and the British 10th Corps landed north of the river; both landings were closely supported by aircraft and naval gunfire. By the end of the day, both corps held a beachhead on the shallow Salerno plain, but with a gap between them. The U.S. 36th Division’s Regimental Combat Teams (RCTs) 141 and 142 made the initial assault, secured a beachhead, and withstood four strong tank counterattacks as the enemy tried futilely to push both RCTs back into the sea. RCT 141, on the right, was particularly hard-pressed but retained its beachhead. The Division reserve&mdash;RCT 143&mdash;was committed in the center during the initial landing. By the end of the day, the Division’s initial objectives on the left flank and in the center had been secured.</p>

Leaders must challenge assumptions, take courageous risks, and inspire others by example and integrity. They must also, however, still be humble, give credit to others, and follow through. In this way they create the legacy that shows the organization’s members what “right” looks like.</p>

On an individual basis, discipline consists of self-control, maturity, and sound judgment in a high-stress, emotionally charged environment. Teamwork is an integral part of discipline; each individual must evaluate his or her own actions and how these actions will affect both the flight and mission accomplishment. Discipline within a flight has a synergistic effect. If the flight lead and wingmen know their respective duties, they will work together as a team. Experience and realistic training leads to solid and professional air discipline.</p>
<p class="answ">The author of the above passage believes that, if the flight lead and wingmen know their duties, they will</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> better be able to accomplish the mission.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> work together as a team.</p>

<p class="ques-j"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-1813" href="#calibre_link-488" class="calibre3">5</a>.</span> LLC stands for “Limited Liability Corporation,” meaning that the business owners’ personal liability for business debts is limited. Without the protection of LLC laws, the owner or owners of a business can be held personally liable for their business’s debts and obligations. The idea of limited liability got its start in Germany in the late 1800s. By the 1940s, the idea had gained acceptance in 17 countries, but the United States was not one of them. In 1977, Wyoming became the first state to pass an LLC law modeled on the German statute. Many other states eventually passed their own versions, although most of them are at least slightly different from one another.</p>
<p class="answ">Why is the idea of limited liability helpful to business owners?</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> because it is a tradition dating back to the 19th century</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> because it is now legal in all 50 states</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> because it can limit their personal risk</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(D)</span> because it lets them take care of their business obligations with personal funds</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(E)</span> because it lets people avoid business liabilities</p>

The benefit of having different kinds of people working together is that they bring their various experiences and insights to help the organization accomplish shared goals. These different parts of the whole are important because, when they are joined together, they make a stronger, more capable totality. It is the strengthened unity and capability resulting from diversity that is important, not just diversity for its own sake.</p>
<p class="answ">What does the writer say about different kinds of people working together?</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> It’s important because it strengthens the entire organization or group.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> It is important for its own sake.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(C)</span> It takes their minds off their personal problems.</p>

Army aviation relies on highly skilled aviators to fly the different types of rotary-wing aircraft needed to conduct demanding and often hazardous combat and support functions throughout the battlespace and around the world. The Army relies on an extensive selection process to sort through the many volunteers applying for flight training and subsequent service as aviators. The process includes an interview with a current Army aviator and passing a physical examination, as well as successful completion of an aptitude test measuring different dimensions considered necessary for effectiveness as an Army aviator.</p>
<p class="answ">How are potential Army aviators chosen for flight training?</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> by ordering those with qualities needed for success to flight school to be aviators</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> by examining applicants for characteristics needed for success as aviators</p>

The pilot must think in three dimensions and must use both arms and both legs constantly to keep the helicopter in the air. Coordination, control touch, and timing are all used simultaneously when flying a helicopter.</p>
<p class="answ">What is the most important overall characteristic of a pilot discussed in this passage?</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> having a great deal of training and skill</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> the ability to pay attention to the aircraft after a great deal of training</p>

The signature belching of its 30 mm Avenger cannon has been one of the most welcome sounds to U.S. and Coalition ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last decade. When a convoy in Afghanistan was attacked while patrolling a highway, its 60 soldiers were pinned behind their vehicles facing heavy Taliban fire from a nearby treeline. One A-10 flew over as a show of force&mdash;often enough to make the enemy break contact due to the Thunderbolt II’s reputation for heavy firepower&mdash;but enemy fire on the ground increased. One A-10 marked the area with two rockets, then his wingman came in and strafed the enemy positions&mdash;but the Taliban just moved closer to the friendly forces. The A-10s came in for a low-angle strafe, 75 ft. above the enemy’s positions and 50 m away from friendly troops. Over the next two hours, the Warthogs flew 15 gun passes, fired nearly all 2,300 of their 30 mm rounds, and dropped three 500-lb. bombs on the enemy fighters. The enemy eventually gave up their attack and the convoy was able to return to its base.</p>

Army officers also served as intelligence and language officers with the military attaché’s office for almost as far back. During this period, American officers were mostly uninvolved observers of Chinese affairs but the Army’s interest in China’s military potential increased after Japan’s invasion of China in 1937. The Chinese resisted with only minimal outside aid for four years, but the United States enlarged its military role in China soon after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.</p>

In 1880, Afghanistan was occupied for the second time by British-Indian forces trying to colonize and annex the area. Malalai’s father, a shepherd, and her fiancé joined with Afghan forces in a large attack on British-Indian forces in Maiwand in July 1880. Like many Afghan women, Malalai was there to help tend to the wounded and provide water and spare weapons. Local sources maintain this was also supposed to be her wedding day. When the Afghan army was losing morale despite superior numbers, Malalai took the Afghan flag and shouted to her fiancé: “Young love! If you don’t fall in the battle of Maiwand, by God, someone is saving you as a symbol of shame!” This inspired the Afghan fighters to redouble their efforts. When a leading flag bearer was killed, Malalai went forward and held up his flag, singing an inspirational poem&mdash;but then Malalai was herself struck down and killed. However, her encouragement spurred her countrymen on to victory. After the battle, Malalai was honored for her efforts and buried in her native village of Khig, where her grave remains today, viewed by those in the region as a shrine.</p>

One applied for aviation duty the morning following the party at which one had insulted the colonel’s lady, for instance. Once in aviation, it was difficult&mdash;verging on the impossible&mdash;to return to the ground Army. There was a certain resentment toward, for example, artillery captains who had never fired a cannon and yet, because of flight pay, were being paid more than artillery majors who had spent their careers in fire direction centers and on the gun lines. But the Korean War, and the establishment of the Aviation School and Center, changed this. Professionals in the ground Army saw the prospect in a flying Army not only of a new way of waging war but an even greater chance of advancement based on smarts and skills.</p>

Its primary mission is training soldiers and leaders to conduct airmobile and air assault helicopter operations; it also trains a limited number of personnel from other services. Instruction includes aircraft identification and orientation, helicopter insertion and extraction, slingload operations, pathfinder operations, and rappelling and fast-roping techniques. Although the Sabalauski Air Assault School at Fort Campbell is considered to be the “original” air assault school, other Army-approved air assault schools either exist or have existed under its oversight at Fort Rucker, Alabama; Fort Hood, Texas; Camp Gruber, Oklahoma; Schofield Barracks, Hawaii; Fort Benning, Georgia; and elsewhere.</p>

Dragoons were raised on an “as needed” basis for service on the Northwest Territory frontier (present-day Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois) in the 1790s and again for the War of 1812. During the War of 1812, only sabers and pistols were issued to the dragoons, but this was not just to save money&mdash;the saber was considered the primary mounted weapon, with the pistol next in importance. Westward expansion revived the importance of dragoons, and on March 2, 1833, Congress added a regiment of dragoons to the Army establishment. This unit was renamed the First Regiment of Dragoons when a second regiment was formed in 1836. The .52 caliber Hall-North Carbine, first issued to dragoons in 1833, was the first percussion weapon and the first breech-loading weapon adopted by any government in the world. Starting in 1851, new uniform regulations introduced the frock coat for everyone, but by 1858 cavalry and dragoons had a coat that was only waist length; the primary dividing line between uniform types was whether a soldier was mounted or not&mdash;an indication of the growing role of cavalry and dragoons in nineteenth century warfare.</p>

The Air Force’s priorities were&mdash;as they had been&mdash;strategic attack and interdiction. The Army’s and Marines’ priorities&mdash;as they had been&mdash;were close air support of troops on the ground. This dispute had its roots in attitudes developed during and after World War I, demonstrated in World War II, and further exacerbated in Korea. It had been arm-wrestled all the way up the chain to the Secretary of Defense in Vietnam, and it remains a friction point (and sometimes worse) today. The Air Force continued to press its strategic air campaign even as the Army and Marines were preparing for the ground war&mdash;not necessarily a bad thing, but not necessarily a balanced situation, either: strategic targets got two-thirds of daily sorties while battlefield shaping (preparation for the ground offensive) got the leftovers. It took the theater commander and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs (both Army four-stars) to reverse the priorities and mission balances.</p>

The appearance of particles from what is understood to be a previous condition of nothingness cannot be explained by modern science, so many cosmologists have decided to accept (for now) that understanding this event is impossible with today’s technology. Quantum physicists believe they may have a clue in their study of particles that appear and disappear without obvious cause, but they are not agreed about just what that means. Some scientists, however, believe that the Big Bang was caused by the will and idea of a divine being&mdash;a supreme architect of the universe.</p>

This is true of every individual and organization, regardless of age or honor, culture or country. Those who avoid accepting responsibility for their actions and inactions may seem either charming or contemptible, but they are similarly juvenile in their denial of their proper role, no matter what the calendar says. In a small child this is, of course, not only excusable but expectable&mdash;children truly don’t understand yet, although most start picking up on it a little by the time they are six or eight. It’s those who are old enough to understand but make the decision, consciously or unconsciously, not to accept responsibility for themselves and their actions&mdash;they cause most of the trouble and unhappiness and tragedy in the world. The rules don’t apply to them, not really; it wasn’t their fault; everyone else was doing it; it wasn’t their responsibility; it was just too hard; they didn’t want to get involved. Those who take up the mantle of adulthood and responsibility may bear it like a gloomy burden they are condemned to carry or drag against their wishes, but the happiest among us bear it easily, like the honor that it is&mdash;knowing that they themselves are not and cannot be perfect, but who are grateful for the opportunity to try.</p>

Gen. Jonathan Wainwright decided to visit the front lines. When Japanese artillery started exploding at treetop level, the Navy lieutenant driving the jeep and everyone else nearby dove into foxholes&mdash;except for Wainwright, who had noticed a captain he knew from earlier days in Virginia. Wainwright took the captain by the arm, asked him how he was, and sat with him on sandbags with his back to the enemy, continuing to talk with him during the length of the bombardment, exposed to enemy shellfire. When the shelling finally stopped, Wainwright got back into his jeep. On the way back to headquarters, the Navy lieutenant asked Wainwright why he had exposed himself to enemy fire the way he had. Wainwright told him: “A general in the United States Army does his best to give his men arms and ammunition, food, medicine, and recreation. We have none of these things. The men are starving. We are running out of ammunition. . . .What can I give them? What can I do for my men? The only thing I can give them now is morale. My life is not worth as much as you think it is. I can give them morale and my presence on the front line is not the waste you think it is. When I sat on the sandbags, I did it deliberately. They want their general and they want to know he is here.

The warrior who will fight a phantom foe in jungle and desert and mountain range and city; who will patiently (if sometimes clumsily) advise and mentor the armies of allies and waverers and recent foes alike, in the hopes of working him- or herself out of a job in that region; this warrior both is and is not the stuff of which legions have been made. They defend the far frontier not as unquestioning, conscripted masses but as creative, committed individuals with multiple competencies who volunteer to answer their calling. These days, he or she is not always a full-time soldier or sailor or airman or Marine; the Reserve and National Guard components of the various services are full of these warriors, not just the active duty “regular” component as it once was. Their devotion is often measured not only in hardships endured but in family sacrifices, missed civilian paychecks and promotions, and children’s birthdays and weddings witnessed via Skype if at all.</p>
<p class="answ">The writer of this passage implies that</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> National Guard and Reserve warriors are better than the active duty military.</p>

Using a combination of guile, persuasion, falsified documents, and his own diplomatic immunity, his nearly single-handed efforts saved some 25,000 Jews from execution&mdash;some literally snatched from death chamber lines. As the Soviet Army neared Budapest in December 1944, Wallenberg persuaded the German general commanding the shrinking Nazi garrison to spare 70,000 more Jews marked for extermination. On January 17, 1945, Wallenberg met with Soviet Army officials to negotiate for food, medicine, and blankets&mdash;and was never heard from again. Soviet authorities initially told the Swedish government that Wallenberg had been taken into “protective custody,” and said nothing else until 1947, when they disavowed any knowledge of his arrest or whereabouts. In 1957, the Soviet story became that Wallenberg had died of a heart attack in 1947&mdash;but between then and 1981, former Gulag prisoners have reported encounters with Wallenberg.</p>

A great flying meeting in the years before the First World War afforded not only spectacle, education, and (for the venturesome few) aerial initiation, but also employment to professional exhibition pilots of several countries. These aerial showmen were the heroes of their time, and nowhere were their evolutions better presented to better effect and warmer appreciation than at the London Aerodrome. Steep banks, glides, and dives were what the crowd loved, and flying in a wind of any strength filled them with astonishment. And there was, of course, always the risk of an accident.</p>
<p class="answ">From this passage, it is reasonable to conclude that</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> pilots were looked down upon until the First World War.</p>

However, at the tender age of just 5 he was sent back to England to stay with a foster family in Southsea, where he was very unhappy. When he was 12 he moved to a boarding school, the United Services College at Westward Ho!, where the headmaster encouraged his literary ability. Despite poor eyesight that handicapped him on the athletic field, he began to blossom. At age 16, he successfully sought to return to Lahore in 1882, where his parents now lived, to work on the <span class="italic">Civil and Military Gazette</span>, and later on its sister paper the <span class="italic">Pioneer</span> in Allahabad.</p>
<p class="answ">From this passage about Rudyard Kipling we can infer that</p>

The “V” was for <span class="italic">Vergeltungswaffen</span>, or “revenge weapon.” The V2 was the first large rocket missile and, unlike the pulse-jet-propelled V1, could not be intercepted once it had been launched because of its high speed and its trajectory, which actually took it out of Earth’s atmosphere before coming back to dive into its target. First test-fired successfully in October 1942, a properly functioning V2 reached a height of about 60 miles at the top of its arc, and could hit areas nearly 200 miles away. The V2 reached a speed of 3,500 mph before its rocket burned out, and people near its impact point heard both a sonic boom and an explosion. Even without an explosive warhead, test model V2s left an impact crater 45 feet deep and 120 feet across. Fired from tractor-drawn trailers, lots of effort went into concealing V2 launch sites; some rockets aimed at London were launched from between avenues of trees in the Dutch town of Wassenaar near the Hague, which provided excellent natural concealment.</p>
<p class="answ">The V2 was</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> a short-range, high-speed weapon without an explosive warhead.</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(B)</span> an evolution of the V1 rocket design, which could be intercepted.</p>

Performance in this context is just showing up&mdash;“I did what I was supposed to”&mdash;which, while essential, is no guarantee of success. Excellence does not happen by chance; it is the result of intention, effort, and adherence to a standard. “Just showing up” is sometimes claimed to be the majority of success&mdash;and it’s true that those who don’t show up fail 100 percent of the time. However, without the determination to do more than just show up, failure is likely&mdash;now accompanied by the waste of time and other resources. We know where the road paved with good intentions leads, but without those intentions nothing good happens. Good intentions without serious effort die stillborn. Effort is important, too&mdash;but we must not confuse effort with results. Only effort focused by dedication to a high standard, backed up by the determination to reach that standard, results in excellence. Our monument to accomplishment is built in stages, one atop the other and needing all those below, with a flag flying at the pinnacle that says, “Nothing worthwhile is ever easy.”</p>
<p class="answ">From this passage, we can infer that the writer</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> believes that just showing up is the majority of success.</p>

Its design must be approved by The Institute of Heraldry (TIOH). SSI of a design approved by TIOH are authorized and prescribed for wear on the green service uniform and utility (Class C) uniforms of the following echelons: armies, corps, regional support commands, divisions, corps support commands, separate brigades and brigade combat teams not assigned to division, and separate regiments not organic to a group, brigade, or division. Personnel assigned to units not authorized an SSI will wear the SSI of the lowest level command to which the unit is assigned. As an exception, personnel assigned to training support regiments and battalions will wear the SSI of the training support division to which assigned or aligned. Soldiers assigned to a Warrior Transition Unit will continue to wear their organizational headgear and SSI authorized from their last unit of assignment. Cadre assigned to U.S. Army Medical Command will wear the U.S. Army Medical Command SSI. Personnel attached to Headquarters Company, U.S. Army, who are assigned to or performing duty with HQDA staff agencies and offices of the DoD, will wear the Army logo SSI on the Class C uniform.</p>

K Company had a king cobra, L Company had a lion, and so on. The men of I Company, though, had trouble finding an appropriate figurehead&mdash;until they came up with the IBU (which stood for “I is the Best Unit”). The IBU had the antlers of a moose, the head of a lion, the body of a gorilla, and the tail of an alligator; it wore jump boots, had main and reserve parachutes strapped on, and carried a pistol in one hand and a knife in the other. The fierce, mythical mascot caught on, and many members of the company had its image tattooed on their left calf. When the unit was redesignated as A Company, 327th Airborne Battle Group in 1956, morale dropped as the IBU Warriors thought they would have to abandon their mascot. When the mascot was kept and renamed Abu, however, morale once again picked up and today’s soldiers of A Company, 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment still proudly call themselves “Abu Warriors.”</p>

The blades of these windmills&mdash;essentially large wood-and-cloth paddles&mdash;took energy from the wind to power mechanical grinding mills. It was only a small intellectual leap to think of this process in reverse: to power the blades mechanically to add energy to the air and produce thrust. Leonardo da Vinci developed a helical screw for a sixteenth-century helicopter toy; later, after the first successful manned balloon flights in 1783, J. P. Blanchard mounted a hand-driven propeller to a balloon, but it was not a practical propulsion device. Numerous other efforts to power hot-air balloons with hand-cranked propellers followed, but none were successful. It was not until 1852 that a propeller connected to a steam engine allowed Henri Giffard to guide his airship over Paris at a top speed of five miles per hour.</p>

In particular, jet propulsion was viewed as technically infeasible. For example, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) reported in 1923 that jet propulsion was “impractical,” but their studies had been aimed at airspeeds of 250 mph or less, where jet propulsion really is impractical. In 1934, the British government still held a similar opinion. Although an Englishman, Frank Whittle, was the first to operate a jet engine successfully in 1937, it was only on a test stand, and it was a private venture not yet supported by the British government. The first jet to fly was an independently conceived gas-turbine German experimental aircraft that first took off in 1939 and, reaching a top speed of 435 mph, eventually reversed the German government’s initial disinterest.</p>

That those who suffer from stroke and brain injuries can often relearn tasks associated with the specific area of brain atrophy or damage confirms this belief. The mind is capable of much more than we have discovered. There are a number of ways to increase personal and organizational creativity. It takes effort, but the benefits are well beyond bottom-line considerations, because creativity influences every aspect of life&mdash;even its quality and length. A 1991 <span class="italic">Life</span> magazine article examined nuns in their eighties and nineties, none of whom showed any evidence of Alzheimer’s disease. Their one common thread was that they worked on jigsaw puzzles every day, and in doing so, apparently held off the ravaging effects of brain deterioration.</p>

Soviet authorities, however, banned the election in the north and refused to allow UN officials to enter North Korea. The newly elected National Assembly went to work forming a government. In July 1948 the first constitution in four millennia of Korean history was promulgated by the National Assembly, and three days later the deputies elected Dr. Syngman Rhee to a four-year presidential term. The Republic of Korea was acknowledged by the UN General Assembly as the only valid government in Korea; thirty-two nations formally recognized the republic, but UN membership was denied by a Soviet veto in April 1949. The North Korean regime accused Dr. Rhee of a variety of crimes, and caricatured members of his government as responsible for problems actually caused by North Korean provocations. For example, although 80 percent of the Republic of Korea’s electric power came from the north, the communists periodically cut off the flow of electricity and then criticized the Seoul government for failing to bring prosperity to the south.</p>

Once aligned with an initial known position, IRUs continuously calculate position and velocity. IRU position accuracy decays with time; this degradation is known as “drift.” Inertial Navigation Systems (INSs) combine the components of an IRU with an internal navigation computer.

The ARFORGEN ensures that every deploying unit is the best led, trained, and equipped force possible. It is a continuous and structured process of generating Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) forces that provide increasing unit readiness over time with units moving through the force pools in the operational readiness cycle. This process results in trained, ready, and cohesive forces prepared for operational deployment. At the same time, it establishes a basis to predictively schedule potential deployments on an Army-wide scale while reducing uncertainty for soldiers, families, employers, and communities that support installations. The ARFORGEN allows AC forces to plan on one potential deployment in three years and RC forces to plan for one potential deployment in five years. If deployment to a combat theater is not necessary for a particular unit, it may be scheduled for a major OCONUS exercise or rotational positioning overseas for a period of less than nine months.</p>
<p class="answ">What is the primary purpose of ARFORGEN?</p>
<p class="qn-alpha"><span class="alp">(A)</span> to guarantee the timing of AC and RC deployments five years ahead of time</p>

The receiver tracks multiple satellites and determines a pseudorange measurement that is then used to determine the user’s location. A minimum of four satellites is necessary to establish an accurate three-dimensional position. The Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible for operating the GPS satellite constellation and monitors the GPS satellites to ensure proper operation. Every satellite’s orbital parameters (ephemeris data) are sent to each satellite for broadcast as part of the data message embedded in the GPS signal. The GPS coordinate system is the Cartesian Earth-centered Earth-fixed coordinates as specified in the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).</p>

It has always been so, whether recognized or not. Regardless of its mechanisms, war remains an equation of human beings and their minds and hearts. No stockpiling of mere things can offset a superiority of minds. When Hannibal burned his boats in <span class="sc">A.D</span> 219 and crossed the uncrossable Alps; when Cortes burned his boats thirteen centuries later and conquered an empire; when Col. Joshua Chamberlain told the men of the 20th Maine to “swing like a gate” and drove his opponents from the field; and when then-Lt. Col. Chris Hughes told his battalion to take a knee, and then to smile at crowding Iraqis, thereby defusing a brewing conflict over a mosque&mdash;none of these measures was in any manual. None had been taught in any school (although they are now, as examples of creativity). Today’s leaders have to know the doctrinal solutions to common challenges&mdash;but they must also know when and how to “color outside the lines” to accomplish the mission.</p>

<p class="h" id="calibre_link-2461"><a href="#calibre_link-824" class="calibre5">TEST FORMAT</a></p>
<p class="noindent">The Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB-E) is used by the U.S. Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard to select flight training candidates from those officers and officer applicants who wish to become aviators. It is also used for all U.S. Navy Officer Candidate School applicants, not just potential aviators.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/01754.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre41" /></p>
<p class="indentt">Unless you are deployed aboard a ship, the ASTB-E is administered on the secure web-based testing platform known as Automated Pilot Examination (APEX); APEX platforms are also equipped with headphones and a video-game-like joystick. If you are deployed aboard a ship at sea, there are paper testing options, but you will need to contact your ship’s testing or education officer to get details on what is available in your situation.</p>
<p class="indent">The first four ASTB-E subtests are all adaptive. The PBM is an interactive multimedia test that assesses motor skills, spatial ability, reaction time, and multitasking abilities. The BI-RV may be taken on any web-enabled computer by an examinee with a user name and password provided by an examiner. This may be (but is not required to be) an APEX-equipped workstation.</p>
<p class="indent">The Math Skills Test (MST) has 20&ndash;30 questions. You have up to 40 minutes to complete this subtest, which assesses your knowledge of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry skills and knowledge, as well as statistics, probability, and exponents (including negative and fractional). Some questions will be word problems, and some will involve equations. There will also be questions that require solving for variables, time/rate/distance calculations, fractions, square roots, and the calculation of geometric shapes’ areas, angles, and perimeters. <a id="calibre_link-3321" class="calibre3"></a>You will not be allowed to use a calculator for either the paper or computerized version of the MST.</p>
<p class="indent">The RCT has 20&ndash;30 questions, and you will have up to 30 minutes to answer them. The questions will present you with a short passage to read, and then you will have to select the answer choice that can be deduced or inferred from the information given to you in the passage.</p>
<p class="indent">The MCT has 20&ndash;30 questions, which you will have up to 15 minutes to solve. It tests your ability to comprehend and reason with mechanical applications and simple physics rules.</p>
<p class="indent">The ANIT has up to 30 questions, and you will have up to 15 minutes to answer those questions. This subtest measures your knowledge of aviation history, nautical terminology and procedures, and aviation-related concepts such as aircraft components, aerodynamic principles, and flight rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="indent">The NATFI is a “forced-choice” computer-adaptive personality inventory consisting of 88 questions. “Forced choice” means that you have to pick one of the pairs of alternatives offered as being more applicable to you&mdash;what you like, what you would do, how you are. The actual questions are not released by the Navy, and, as a result of this, no practice questions are included here.</p>
<p class="indent">The PBM is a set of interactive, multimedia, performance-based tests that are similar to some video games. It tests your motor skills, spatial abilities (how well you think in three dimensions), reaction time, ability to concentrate despite distractions, multitasking abilities, physical dexterity, and hand-eye coordination. When taking the PBM, you will use a joystick and throttle combination (sometimes known as a “hands-on throttle and stick” setup) and headphones. All of these will be provided to you by the test site. Due to its hands-on nature, this subtest cannot be tested here in this book.</p>
<p class="indent">The Biographical Inventory with Response Verification (BI-RV) is an unproctored (unsupervised) subtest taken outside of the APEX environment as a separate testing session. It takes anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours to complete, and it does not have to be completed in a single session. The Navy actually recommends that you get it done before you take the rest of the ASTB-E if you can; your recruiter can help you with this. Again, due to its nature&mdash;it’s not a test, it’s a listing of what you’ve done in certain areas up to this point in your life&mdash;practice questions are not included here.</p>

<p class="noindent">Specialized warships, even ships suitable for war, are relatively recent in origin. They have always been expensive to build and they require handling by specialist crews. Their construction and operation therefore demand considerable disposable wealth, probably the surplus of a ruler’s revenue; and if the earliest form of fighting at sea was piratical rather than political in motive, we must remember that even the pirate needs capital to start in business. The first navies may or may not have been anti-piratical in purpose&mdash;the advantages conferred by the ability to move forces or supplies along rivers or coasts may have first prompted rulers to maintain warships&mdash;but navies are, by definition, more costly than individual ships. Whichever way it is looked at, fighting on water has cost more than fighting on land from the start.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Dr. Albert Mehrabian, a noted researcher in the field of nonverbal communication (UCLA), found that only 7 percent of our feelings and attitudes are communicated with words, 38 percent via tone of voice, and a whopping 55 percent through nonverbal expressions. These numbers are astonishing, but that’s only part of the picture . . . the communications channels over which we have the most control, and understand the best, have the least amount of impact. And the channels over which we have the least control, and understand the least, have the most impact.</p>

<p class="noindent1">The way the Roman legions came to serve so far from the Roman army’s birthplace and to embrace so wide a range of recruits began during the Punic Wars with Carthage. That city, a Phoenician colony, first fell into conflict with the Romans when the latter’s success in subduing their Italian neighbors drew them south to Sicily, which Carthage regarded as within its sphere of influence; Rome’s confrontation with Pyrrhus, also an enemy of Carthage, weakened its position on the island. In 265 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> the two powers found themselves at war over Sicily, and the war rapidly expanded, by both land and sea, until the Carthaginians had to concede defeat and the Romans established control over Sicily. While Rome added Corsica and Sardinia to these beginnings of its overseas empire, and made its first inroads into the land of the Gauls, Carthage responded by campaigning along the Mediterranean coast of Spain against cities that were Rome’s allies. The siege of Saguntum in 219 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> brought war on afresh; it lasted 17 years, ended in Carthaginian defeat only after Rome barely avoided catastrophe, and established the Romans as the dominant Mediterranean power.</p>

<p class="noindent1">In any planning, especially strategic planning, it is vitally important to select the “right” objectives. In fact, some would suggest that this is the primary role of strategic planning. In addition to setting the “right” objectives, part of the job of planning is to determine the best means of achieving the objectives and, further, to facilitate effective communication and review of the means as the plan is executed. In order to select the “right” objectives, the planners must, among other things, do their work in the context of the higher-order purposes of the organization.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><a id="calibre_link-3329" class="calibre3"></a>The traditions of Freemasonry have evolved over many centuries and from many sources. They are a powerful source of the cement that gels a Lodge and Freemasons into one sacred band. Often, the traditions are never codified into law but are taught from mouth to ear. They can be modified (slowly) to fit the needs of the organization. Most Lodges adhere to the same traditions, but some may have adopted some of their own. As members become aware of the traditions, they soon learn that they are part of something larger than themselves.</p>

No modern athletic hero has exceeded Ruth’s capacity to project multiple images of brute power, the natural, uninhibited man, and the fulfillment of the legendary American success formula. Ruth was living proof that the lone individual could still rise from mean, vulgar beginnings to fame and fortune, to a position of public recognition equaled by few men in American history. His mighty home runs represented a dramatic finality, a total clearing of the bases with one mighty swat.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Most drivers try to drive safely. A major part of safe driving is driving at the right speed. But what is the “right” speed? Is it 20 miles per hour, or 35, or 60? That question may be hard to answer. On some city streets and in heavy traffic, 20 miles per hour could be too fast, even if it’s within the posted speed limit. On a superhighway, 35 miles per hour could be too slow. Of course, a good driver must follow the speed limit, but he must also use good judgment. The “right” speed will vary depending on the number of cars, the road surface and its condition, and the driver’s visibility.</p>

<p class="noindent1">There are a number of different varieties of quarks: there are thought to be at least six “flavors,” which we call up, down, strange, charmed, bottom, and top. Each flavor comes in three “colors”: red, green, and blue. (It should be emphasized that these terms are just labels: quarks are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light and so do not have any color in the normal sense. It is just that modern physicists seem to have more imaginative ways of naming new particles and phenomena&mdash;they no longer restrict themselves to Greek!) A proton or neutron is made up of three quarks, one of each color. A proton contains two up quarks and one down quark; a neutron contains two down and one up. We can create particles made up of the other quarks (strange, charmed, bottom, and top), but these all have a much greater mass and decay very rapidly into protons and neutrons.</p>

<p class="noindent1">The War of 1812 was in many ways one of the most unfortunate events in American history. For one reason, it was needless; the British Orders in Council that had caused the worst irritation were being unconditionally repealed just as Congress declared war. For another, the United States suffered from internal divisions of the gravest kind. While the South and West favored war, New York and New England in general opposed it, and toward its end important New England groups went to the very edge of disloyalty. For a third reason, the war was far from glorious in a military sense: the American army was in wretched shape to fight.</p>

<p class="ans-top">The tactical effect of speech is not only that it improves cohesion&mdash;from which comes unified action&mdash;but that it is the vital spark in all maneuver. Speech galvanizes the desire to work together. It is the beginning of the urge to get something done. Until there is speech, each soldier is likely to think of his situation in purely negative terms; with the coming of speech, he starts to face up to it. If you doubt this, put yourself in the middle of a group of men who have just been pinned down by close-range sniper fire. What happens? These men will hug the dirt or snuggle up to the nearest log or boulder or building remnant, but they won’t do anything constructive about their situation until one of them makes a specific suggestion: “It’s too hot; let’s get out of here,” or “You cover me while I work my way up to that treeline.”</p>

<p class="ans-top">By September 23, the Communists were in obvious retreat. The 1st Cavalry Division received the mission of pushing up the central corridor toward the X Corps beachhead at Inchon. The division commander organized Task Force 777 (built mostly around elements of Custer’s onetime unit, the 7th Cavalry), which was to drive north&mdash;disregarding flanks and lateral contact&mdash;avoid decisive engagement with the retreating enemy, and move night and day to effect a linkup. The 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, under Lt. Col. James H. Lynch, was reinforced and designated “Task Force Lynch”&mdash;this was the pointy end of the 1st Cavalry Division’s spearhead. By midmorning of September 26, with little more than a hundred miles to go, Lynch’s troopers were bypassing gaggles of disorganized, leaderless North Korean People’s Army soldiers, and were cheered by villagers whose homes were still on fire in the wake of the retreating invaders. Lynch’s lead group of three Pershing tanks plowed ahead so far and so fast that they outran even radio contact. By ten that night, they had made contact with the 31st Infantry Regiment north of Osan&mdash;but only after a blaze of hair-trigger American antitank fire at the unexpected visitors took off the head of a tank crewman in one of the Pershings.</p>

<p class="ans-top">A credibility check has its roots in a leader’s history as it is known by other people; it has to do with reputation. Reputation is human collateral&mdash;the security we pledge to guarantee the performance of our obligations as leaders, friends, colleagues, and citizens. It is what supports the (usually natural) human instinct to <span class="italic">want</span> to trust.

<p class="ans-top"><a id="calibre_link-3351" class="calibre3"></a>During the Battle of the Bulge, the town of Bastogne was occupied by the American 101st Airborne Division to control the vital crossroads there, but surrounded by the German Army as it tried to unexpectedly slice through a lightly held sector to the port of Antwerp. On December 22, 1944, four Germans under a flag of truce, carrying a surrender demand, approached the lines of the 327th Infantry Regiment on the outskirts of Bastogne. The message cited the progress of attacking German forces farther west as evidence of the futility of holding out at Bastogne, and demanded the surrender of the encircled town within two hours. The surrender demand was delivered to acting division commander Brig. Gen. Anthony C. McAuliffe as he was about to leave his headquarters to congratulate the defenders of a roadblock who had driven off a heavy attack. He dropped the message on the floor, said “Nuts,” and left. When he returned, his staff reminded him of the message, which he at first had not taken seriously; McAuliffe asked his staff what they thought should be the reply. The division operations officer said, “That first remark of yours would be hard to beat.” So the message delivered to the Germans read, “To the German Commander: Nuts! The American Commander.” The confused German major asked if this was affirmative or negative; he was told by the 327th’s regimental commander that it was “decidedly not affirmative.”</p>

<p class="ans-top"><a id="calibre_link-3352" class="calibre3"></a>Our current understanding of the motion of objects dates back to Newton and Galileo. Before then, people held to Aristotle’s ideas that the “natural state” of an object was to be at rest, and that it moved only if it was caused to move by some force. Aristotle also thought one could figure out all the principles governing the universe by reason alone; there was no need to physically verify those conclusions by experimentation or observation&mdash;so no one until Galileo checked to see if bodies of differing weights <span class="italic">actually</span> fell at different velocities. The story goes that Galileo dropped weights from the leaning tower of Pisa, but whether or not this is actually true, we know that he did roll balls of differing weights down a smooth slope (an easier experiment because the speeds are less). Galileo’s experiment showed that each body increased its speed at the same rate, no matter what its weight. His work was then used by Newton to deduce his three laws of motion.</p>

The biggest problem happens when the student who is attacked gets swept up in the punishment net along with the one who started the fight&mdash;unless he doesn’t fight back and lets himself get pummeled. It is morally wrong to teach our kids that the attacked person is invariably as much in the wrong as the attacker. The correct solution, instead, is a balanced application of reasonable judgment by administrators, backed up by a determination to tell the truth to parents. Parents, too, have an obligation&mdash;to recognize that their little angel may not be perfect, and not to sue the school because a teacher or principal told them an unpleasant truth.</p>

Perfect information seldom if ever exists even in non-adversarial situations, much less when the adversary is actively trying to deny you the facts&mdash;or sell you the wrong ones.

In 1839, the Texas House passed a law calling for three leagues (13,285 acres) to be set aside in each county for a “primary school or academy,” and 50 leagues to be set aside for two colleges. However, the official system of public schools did not even begin to become a reality until after Texas was admitted to the Union as a state in 1845.</p>

First, the 1.5 million inhabitants of the British colonies in 1754 were tenacious, resourceful, and growing quickly&mdash;while New France had fewer than 100,000 people, brave but scattered and deficient in initiative. Second, the British held a better strategic geographical position. While operating on interior lines of communication and transportation, they could effectively strike westward at what is now Pittsburgh, northwestward toward Niagara, and northward toward Quebec and Montreal. They also had a better navy, could more quickly reinforce and supply their troops, and could lay siege to Quebec by water.

This resulted in self-imposed inhibitions on political speech to avoid federal prosecution, as well as loss of income by trying to comply. By 1987, however, it was recognized that the Doctrine was “antagonistic to the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment,” and the speech-stifling regulation was itself stifled&mdash;or rather, gleefully strangled by those who were willing to engage in the give-and-take of a fair public debate.</p>

<p class="answ"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2582" href="#calibre_link-1072" class="calibre3">1</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> GLOVE is to HAND as SHOE is to <span class="bold">FOOT</span>. This is a “tool to user” analogy; a shoe is a protective, warming cover for the foot in the same way that a glove performs the same functions for the hand.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2583" href="#calibre_link-1073" class="calibre3">2</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> AIRCRAFT is to FLY as BOAT is to <span class="bold">SAIL</span>. This is an “object to function” analogy; an aircraft is a means of conveyance or transportation used to fly, just as a boat is a means of transportation used to sail.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2584" href="#calibre_link-1074" class="calibre3">3</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> PLAN is to STRATEGY as FIGHT is to <span class="bold">BATTLE</span>. This is an “action to result” analogy; one does the first to make the second happen or come into being.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2585" href="#calibre_link-1075" class="calibre3">4</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> TRAVEL is to DESTINATION as WORK is to <span class="bold">GOAL</span>. This is another “action to result” analogy&mdash;you travel to reach your destination, and you work to get to or achieve your goal.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2586" href="#calibre_link-1076" class="calibre3">5</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> PLOW is to FIELD as RACQUET is to <span class="bold">COURT</span>. A plow is a tool or implement to be used on a field, just as a racquet is an implement used on a court.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2587" href="#calibre_link-1077" class="calibre3">6</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> SALUTE is to RESPECT as HUG is to <span class="bold">AFFECTION</span>. This is a form of a “result to cause” analogy; a salute is a physical gesture resulting from respect held for another, and a hug is a physical symbol of affection (the cause of the result or physical action).</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2588" href="#calibre_link-1078" class="calibre3">7</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> GRAVITY is to PLANET as ODOR is to <span class="bold">SKUNK</span>. Another “result to cause” analogy; gravity is caused by the presence of a planet in roughly the same way that odor is caused by or comes from a skunk.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2589" href="#calibre_link-1079" class="calibre3">8</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> FISHING ROD is to HOOK as KNIFE is to <span class="bold">BLADE</span>. This is a “whole to part” analogy. A hook is the part of a fishing rod that actually enables the rod’s function to be fulfilled (to catch fish), in the same way that the blade is the part of a knife that fulfills the function of a knife (to cut). Choice (E) is not correct because, even though a handle <span class="italic">is</span> part of a knife, it is not the part that performs the primary function of the tool in the way that the blade is.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2590" href="#calibre_link-1080" class="calibre3">9</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> BOOT is to HIKE as VISOR is to <span class="bold">WELD</span>. In the same way that a boot protects and helps the hiker, a visor protects and helps the welder&mdash;an “object to function” analogy.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><a id="calibre_link-3392" class="calibre3"></a><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2591" href="#calibre_link-1081" class="calibre3">10</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> PUSH is to SHOVE as CLIMB is to <span class="bold">CLAMBER</span>. This is an analogy of language; <span class="italic">push</span> and <span class="italic">shove</span> mean nearly the same thing, as do <span class="italic">climb</span> and <span class="italic">clamber</span>.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2592" href="#calibre_link-1082" class="calibre3">11</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> GROW is to MATURE as BLOOM is to <span class="bold">BLOSSOM</span>. <span class="italic">Grow</span> and <span class="italic">mature</span> mean very nearly the same thing, as do <span class="italic">bloom</span> and <span class="italic">blossom</span>&mdash;another language-based analogy.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2593" href="#calibre_link-1083" class="calibre3">12</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> FUSELAGE is to BODY as <span class="bold">TURRET is to</span> <span class="bold">TANK</span>. This is a “part to whole” analogy. <span class="italic">Fuselage</span> is a specific term for the main part of the body of an airplane; <span class="italic">turret</span> is a term for the main part of a tank.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2594" href="#calibre_link-1084" class="calibre3">13</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> CLIMB is to RISE as DIVE is to <span class="bold">FALL</span>. Although it may at first appear to be a language analogy&mdash;these word pairs almost seem like synonyms&mdash;this is actually an “action to result” analogy. A pilot causes his airplane to climb in order to rise, whereas he causes the plane to dive in order to fall or lose altitude.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2595" href="#calibre_link-1085" class="calibre3">14</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> ROPE is to KNOT as THREAD is to <span class="bold">FABRIC</span>. This is a “part to whole” analogy; a rope is used to make a knot, just as a thread is manipulated to make fabric.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2596" href="#calibre_link-1086" class="calibre3">15</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> WATCH is to OBSERVE as SWITCH is to <span class="bold">REPLACE</span>. Here we have an analogy of language&mdash;both these pairs of words are synonyms.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2597" href="#calibre_link-1087" class="calibre3">16</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> OBEY is to COMPLY as REPLY is to <span class="bold">ANSWER</span>. Both these pairs of words are synonyms&mdash;another language analogy.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2598" href="#calibre_link-1088" class="calibre3">17</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> HONOR is to HONESTY as TRUST is to <span class="bold">DEPENDABILITY</span>. This is an “action to result” analogy; honor is a result of consistent honesty, just as trust is a by-product of consistent dependability.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2599" href="#calibre_link-1089" class="calibre3">18</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> SPEED is to DECELERATION as VELOCITY is to <span class="bold">BRAKING</span>. This is an “action to result” analogy. When an automobile driver, for instance, decreases his speed in a car (usually by stepping on the brake pedal), it is called <span class="italic">deceleration</span>; decreased velocity, similarly, is usually caused by braking.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2600" href="#calibre_link-1090" class="calibre3">19</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> COMPRESSION is to RAREFACTION as DENSE is to <span class="bold">THIN</span>. Sound is made up of successive compression and rarefaction waves in the air&mdash;respectively, thickened and thinned areas resulting from the source of the sound. This is an analogy of language&mdash;these are opposites, or antonyms.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2601" href="#calibre_link-1091" class="calibre3">20</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> DELAY is to POSTPONE as PREVENT is to <span class="bold">DETER</span>. <span class="italic">Delay</span> and <span class="italic">postpone</span> mean the same thing, to put something off or do it later; <span class="italic">prevent</span> and <span class="italic">deter</span> both mean to stop something from happening. This is another analogy of language, since these are basically synonyms.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2602" href="#calibre_link-1092" class="calibre3">21</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> ADD is to SUBTRACT as GROW is to <span class="bold">SHRINK</span>. <span class="italic">Add</span> and <span class="italic">subtract</span> are opposite concepts, as are <span class="italic">grow</span> and <span class="italic">shrink</span>. This is an analogy of language, since they are antonyms.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2603" href="#calibre_link-1093" class="calibre3">22</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> LEFT is to PORT as RIGHT is to <span class="bold">STARBOARD</span>. This is an analogy of language; <span class="italic">port</span> is an aviation and nautical term for <span class="italic">left</span>, and <span class="italic">starboard</span> refers to the right side or direction.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2604" href="#calibre_link-1094" class="calibre3">23</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> ODOMETER is to DISTANCE as ALTIMETER is to <span class="bold">ALTITUDE</span>. In the same way that an odometer measures road distance traveled, an altimeter measures an aircraft’s altitude above Earth.

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Check your answers below</span></p>
<p class="answ"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2682" href="#calibre_link-1172" class="calibre3">1</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> The primary purpose of this passage is to <span class="bold">identify some of the results of both successful and unsuccessful American joint military operations</span>. Although the passage does mention historical examples of American joint military operations from the Revolutionary War through World War I, it does not discuss the evolution of doctrine (how operations are conducted) (choice (A)), nor does it compare American and European joint operations (choice (B)). The passage is also too short to provide a comprehensive historical account (choice (D)) or summarize lessons learned from American joint military operations (choice (E)).</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2683" href="#calibre_link-1173" class="calibre3">2</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> In the first paragraph, the word “autonomously” most nearly means <span class="bold">independently</span>. The context gives strong clues, since the end of that sentence says that the president was the Army and the Navy’s “only common superior”&mdash;i.e., the only higher authority they shared was the very top of the pyramid&mdash;and the very next sentence mentions the “outward independence” of the Army and the Navy. Additionally, the root <span class="italic">auto</span> means “self,” as in the <span class="italic">automobile</span> that doesn’t need horses or oxen to pull it.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2684" href="#calibre_link-1174" class="calibre3">3</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> You can infer from the passage that <span class="bold">there was no standardized way of coordinating joint operations during the first century of American military operations</span>. You can deduce this from the fact that it took until 1903 to form any kind of organization or office responsible for coordinating Army and Navy operations. The numerous failures cited show that joint operations were not easy (choice (B)), and those same failures demonstrated that American military operations did not in fact become continually more effective over time (choice (C)). The increasing complexity of warfare during the 1700s and 1800s is not mentioned in the passage, although it is true&mdash;and that increasing complexity made joint operations more necessary, not less necessary (choice (D)). Since joint operations means “operations involving more than one service,” the idea of joint operations being primarily an Army responsibility is a contradiction in terms (choice (E)).</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2685" href="#calibre_link-1175" class="calibre3">4</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> As used throughout the passage, the term “joint” means <span class="bold">involving more than one service</span>. The third sentence of the first paragraph parenthetically defines “joint” as “multi-service.”</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2686" href="#calibre_link-1176" class="calibre3">5</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> This passage’s author would most likely agree with the statement that <span class="bold">“Joint military operations have been important throughout history</span>.<span class="bold">”</span> The passage cites multiple instances of joint operations before the airplane was invented (choice (A)), and the unsuccessful examples illustrate that joint operational principles were neither well <a id="calibre_link-3406" class="calibre3"></a>established nor well known throughout history, much less since ancient times (choice (B)). The joint fumbles involving American forces, as listed in the passage, demonstrate that there was no such thing as a clear view of the importance of joint operations (choice (C)), and the last paragraph specifically refutes the statement in choice (E).</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2687" href="#calibre_link-1177" class="calibre3">6</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> The primary purpose of the passage is to <span class="bold">discuss the connections between organizational culture and leadership</span>. This is summed up neatly in the last sentence of the passage that calls leadership and culture “two sides of the same coin.”</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2688" href="#calibre_link-1178" class="calibre3">7</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> Throughout the passage, the term “culture” is used to mean <span class="bold">the attitudes and behaviors characteristic of a particular group or organization</span>. This is demonstrated by the discussion of culture’s role in the first paragraph, which notes that culture largely determines “how we are supposed to perceive, feel, and act in a given society.”</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2689" href="#calibre_link-1179" class="calibre3">8</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> In the last paragraph, the word “dysfunctional” most nearly means <span class="bold">deviating from the norms of social behavior in a way that is regarded as bad or ineffective</span>. You can infer the word’s meaning from the rest of the sentence, where “dysfunctional” cultural elements are cited as the impetus that causes the need for leaders to make changes.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2690" href="#calibre_link-1180" class="calibre3">9</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> You can infer from the passage that <span class="bold">both leaders and members of an organization have an impact on its culture</span>. The passage repeatedly mentions the impact that both leaders and group or organizational members have on the organization’s culture&mdash;how members of the group are supposed to perceive, feel, and act.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2691" href="#calibre_link-1181" class="calibre3">10</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> The statement with which the passage’s author would most likely agree is <span class="bold">“Leadership that is attuned to its organization’s culture is the most likely to be successful</span>.<span class="bold">”</span> While this is implied in several places throughout the passage, the last paragraph’s discussion of leadership and culture being two sides of the same coin is the most obvious.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2692" href="#calibre_link-1182" class="calibre3">11</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> The primary idea of this passage is to <span class="bold">provide an overview of U.S. national-level intelligence efforts since the nation’s founding</span>. Although the other answer choices are touched on in the passage, they are not examined in detail.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2693" href="#calibre_link-1183" class="calibre3">12</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> In the sixth paragraph, the word “vested” most nearly means <span class="bold">fully or significantly involved or engaged</span>. This term originated in the financial world, frequently relating to matching retirement fund contributions from an employer. However, as is done in this passage, its usage has expanded to show acknowledged and demonstrated interest in a subject by an individual or an organization.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2694" href="#calibre_link-1184" class="calibre3">13</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> From the information in the passage, you could infer that <span class="bold">the Axis Powers wanted to change the international status quo</span>. The Axis Powers are mentioned in the sixth paragraph among the list of foreign powers “whose policies directly threatened the status quo.”</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2695" href="#calibre_link-1185" class="calibre3">14</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> The threat of terrorism in the 21st century is mentioned mainly to bring the narrative of U.S. national-level intelligence up to the present day and to compare and contrast intelligence efforts against terrorism versus those against nation-states (<span class="bold">both choice (A) and choice (B)</span>). The passage does not discuss terrorist groups’ reasons for existence.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2696" href="#calibre_link-1186" class="calibre3">15</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> The passage’s author would likely agree with the following statement: <span class="bold">“Although started relatively late in its national history, the U.S. national intelligence program is trying to make up for lost time.</span><span class="bold">”</span> All the other statements are directly contradicted by information in the passage.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><a id="calibre_link-3407" class="calibre3"></a><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2697" href="#calibre_link-1187" class="calibre3">16</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> The primary purpose of this passage is to <span class="bold">identify the essential professional qualities of U.S. joint military leaders and service members</span>. The militaries of other nations are not mentioned (choice (A)). The passage only directly discusses professional conduct, not personal conduct (choice (C)). The passage neither praises the courage of U.S. service members (choice (D)) nor encourages joint leaders to be students of the art and science of war (choice (E))&mdash;it states these conditions as requirements, not just as something to be encouraged.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2698" href="#calibre_link-1188" class="calibre3">17</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> In the passage’s next to last paragraph, the word “epitomizes” most nearly means <span class="bold">to be a perfect example of something</span>; in this case, selfless service perfectly embodies “putting our nation, our military missions, and others before ourselves.”</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2699" href="#calibre_link-1189" class="calibre3">18</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> Based solely on the information in the passage, it would be reasonable to infer that <span class="bold">military leaders who do not embody the values mentioned in the passage would have difficulty being effective in the American military</span>. Since the passage makes it clear that these values are the standards and requirements of the American military, someone who does not embody these values would be judged as not meeting the appropriate standards. Not only would that individual have a hard time being effective, but he or she would likely be asked to leave.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2700" href="#calibre_link-1190" class="calibre3">19</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> Fellow citizens being referred to as resources to be expended is meant to <span class="bold">illustrate the costs associated with the responsibility of military leadership</span>. This statement is meant to emphasize the potentially high cost of the loss of human life. People are the most important resources in any organization, especially in the military&mdash;and part of leadership is balancing risk (including the potential loss of life) with the potential for mission accomplishment.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2701" href="#calibre_link-1191" class="calibre3">20</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> The passage’s author would likely agree with the following statement: <span class="bold">“All service members, but especially officers, are expected to have and maintain strong character and values.”</span> Courage is not the absence of fear, but its mastery (choice (A)), and the passage specifically makes the points that character and values can and must be learned (choices (B) and (C)). The passage also makes the point that all service members&mdash;not just leaders&mdash;are required to have and maintain strong character and values (choice (D)).</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2702" href="#calibre_link-1192" class="calibre3">21</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> The primary purpose of the passage is to <span class="bold">define U.S. Air Force leadership</span>. The first sentence of the passage lays out the framework, and then goes into more detail about the elements of U.S. Air Force leadership and how they are or should be applied. The other answer choices are touched on in the passage, but only in support of the passage’s primary purpose, defining U.S. Air Force leadership.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2703" href="#calibre_link-1193" class="calibre3">22</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> Based on the information in the passage, you could infer that <span class="bold">different organizational levels require different leadership styles</span>. The last paragraph discusses the differences and similarities of junior, mid-level, and senior leaders.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2704" href="#calibre_link-1194" class="calibre3">23</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> According to the passage, successful leaders must <span class="bold">continually ensure that the needs of their unit’s people are met promptly and properly</span>. This is laid out in the last sentence of the fourth paragraph.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2705" href="#calibre_link-1195" class="calibre3">24</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> In the passage’s sixth paragraph, the word “ethos” most nearly means <span class="bold">the distinguishing character or guiding beliefs of a group</span>. The distinguishing characteristics and attitudes of the warrior ethos are laid out directly in the sixth paragraph, and indirectly <a id="calibre_link-3408" class="calibre3"></a>throughout the passage. While these attitudes and characteristics are backed up by both emotions and logic, and require correct technical decisions in support of mission accomplishment, the warrior ethos encompasses all of these and more.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-2706" href="#calibre_link-1196" class="calibre3">25</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> The quote that the passage’s author would likely agree with is: <span class="bold">“</span><span class="bold">Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It’s about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it.”</span> While the other quotes may be interesting for their metaphors or hard-nosed pithiness, they run counter to all the ideas expressed in the passage, while choice (E) encapsulates those ideas.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (D) is the most effective choice.</span> When members of the chain of command are elsewhere, a subordinate (usually the most senior person) steps up to fill in. Also, people sometimes act differently one-on-one than when they are in a group; showing the senior NCO’s acting replacement that you trust him or her will likely help you get an informative response. Ideally, the superior who assigned you to lead the section would already have given you an idea of its mission and daily routine (choice (C)); since he or she didn’t (and since you didn’t ask when you got the job), it makes sense to find out what you can before going back to that superior. The section’s situation may have changed since the previous section leader departed (choice (A)), but whether it has or not, it makes more sense to save this option for later when you have specific questions. Likewise, calling a section meeting to let the section know what changes you want (choice (E)) should happen <span class="italic">after</span> you find out what the section’s mission and routine are&mdash;and probably long after even that, when you have had time to gather enough information to make a solid assessment. <span class="bold">Calling the senior section NCO while he is on emergency leave (choice (B)) is the last thing you want to do if you can avoid it</span>&mdash;his mind will be focused on the reason he is on emergency leave (not the job), and you have plenty of other options to try first.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">The most effective action is choice (B).</span> You are in charge of the project, so go directly to the source of the problem, the engineer. You want to do this privately so that you can both be frank but professional, without the obstacles to communication caused by addressing the issue in an open meeting. Choices (C), (D), and (E) are all in a race to be the least effective action, but the “winner” <span class="bold">(i.e., least effective) is choice (E)</span>, which violates two tenets of leadership. Problems should be handled at the lowest level possible, but in this action, not only did you not try to deal with it yourself, but you bypassed both the engineer and your own supervisors when you went directly to the commander. One of the major parts of a subordinate leader’s role is to handle problems at his or her level so that the next level up does not have to. When those subordinate leaders don’t even get the chance to do their job and solve problems at their level, nothing good happens&mdash;after you present the full, unfiltered information to the commander, he is going to go back to the engineer’s supervisor to set him straight and to your supervisor to teach you about the chain of command&mdash;or maybe find a replacement.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (B) is the most effective action</span>, as it will get the tent put up the quickest with the fairest distribution of work. <span class="bold">Choice (A) is the least effective action</span> since it does not take care of the section’s personnel, exposing them unnecessarily to the risk of sleeping in the rain and abdicating your responsibility as a leader&mdash;regardless of the section members’ lack of willingness to do what is not only the right thing, but also an easy right thing.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (D) is the most effective action.</span> It is tactful and professional, but does not sweep the problem under the rug. The briefer would probably appreciate honest feedback from someone she knows at least a little, directly and sooner, instead of second-hand criticism later. Adapting one’s briefing/communication style is very important in the increasingly common circumstance of a video or audio teleconference. In this case (as in most cases), it’s important to be honest but tactful at the same time. Choice (A) would likely be perceived as talking badly about someone behind his or her back; while your intentions might be honorable, it undermines a colleague and will likely be seen by others as unprofessional. It’s also likely that a distorted version of your comments will make it back to the briefer. In choice (B), it may seem like you are doing the briefer a favor by immediately but discreetly bringing the issue to her attention, but doing it during the call is more likely to throw her off balance than help her. Additionally, using text messaging instead of speaking to her directly can lead to misinterpretation; she may not take your comments in the constructive manner you intend them to be. Choice (C) does not use your own communication skills to their best advantage and may be seen as just complaining. <span class="bold">Choice (E) is the least effective action.</span> Although it provides timely, direct feedback, it is also unnecessarily embarrassing to the briefing officer involved and is therefore unprofessional. It may get the briefing officer to slow down, but you (and your unit) will reap far more negative consequences than that action is worth.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (B) is the most effective action</span> because it maintains your integrity but creatively seeks a solution that will improve the situation. <span class="bold">Choice (A) is the least effective action</span>, as it <a id="calibre_link-3411" class="calibre3"></a>gives away your integrity, shows your Airmen that you are more interested in doing the easy thing than doing the right thing, and does not seek to improve the situation. The qualification manual’s standards were put in place for a reason; it is unwise to disregard them and cover it up as your Airmen will not be operationally trained and ready at the level you are reporting them to be.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (E) is the most effective action</span>; many times noncompliance with a leader’s directions results from not knowing how, or not knowing why, compliance is important. <span class="bold">Choice (B) is the least effective action</span>, as it ignores the possible training/knowledge shortfall in the section leaders, and it also demonstrates a “do as I say, not as I do” attitude on your part. There’s also an old saying: “If it’s not written down, it didn’t happen.”</p>

<p class="noindent1">The seemingly unconventional <span class="bold">choice (C) is actually the most effective action</span>, while <span class="bold">choice (A) is the most strikingly ineffective action</span> of the other bad choices listed. This situation is based on an actual occurrence in Najaf, Iraq, in 2003. Army Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Christopher P. Hughes was leading soldiers from his battalion toward Najaf, one of Iraq’s holy cities, to secure the town and protect both the mosque and a Muslim cleric who had been put under house arrest by deposed dictator Saddam Hussein. However, Ba’athist agitators started to spread the rumor that the Americans were coming not to protect the mosque and its associated Shrine of Ali, but to invade it. The previously friendly Iraqis around the patrol turned angry and started shouting and throwing rocks. The American troops were hot in their chemical protective suits and hadn’t slept in two to three days; tempers began to fray. However, LTC Hughes held his rifle upside down&mdash;showing that he had no intention of using it&mdash;and moved among his troops, ordering them to take a knee, lower their weapons, and smile. He also told them to take off their sunglasses, which made them more human to the surrounding Iraqis. Once the crowd quieted, he told his men to back up, turn around, and walk away, rather than backing away&mdash;which in Arab culture shows fear. The next day, after the agitators were removed and confusion cleared up, the same unit entered Najaf peacefully.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (C) is the most effective action</span> here&mdash;when the leader does not have experience in an area but has experienced subordinate leaders, it’s almost always a good idea to get their input; it also reinforces an attitude of professional respect in the unit that will pay big dividends. <span class="bold">Choice (A) is the least effective action</span>, as it abdicates your duty as a leader. Even if a leader doesn’t have any idea what to do, the leader’s job is to <span class="italic">figure out</span> what to do.</p>

<p class="noindent1">This situation illustrates some of the potential difficulties romantic relationships between service members with different ranks or levels of influence can cause. <span class="bold">Choice (D) is the most effective action</span> because it gives the appropriate level of importance to professional and personal concerns: you did not try to use undue influence to get Lieutenant Davidson out of a mission (choices (A) and (E)), and you did not allow an unforeseen change to damage your <a id="calibre_link-3412" class="calibre3"></a>relationship (choices (B) and (C)). Of these unethical and ill-advised options, <span class="bold">choice (E) is the least effective action</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (E) is likely the most effective action</span> here. Since you have not been initially successful in helping the new unit member, a colleague may be more successful in reaching him&mdash;and you do have your own report to do on your own deadline. One note here: it’s a good idea to explain to the new unit member what you are doing and why, so that he can see he is not being pushed aside as unimportant, while at the same time freeing yourself up to fulfill your individual responsibility. <span class="bold">Choice (D) is the least effective action</span>, as it tells the new unit member that he is not important in your eyes when you make no effort to balance competing needs or bring in new resources to help everyone accomplish their missions.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (C) is the most effective action.</span> Willingness to help other sections of the unit is important, but this should be coordinated with your flight leader since your flight is not only shorthanded but also unusually busy; your flight leader also might have other work scheduled that you don’t know about yet, so it’s important to give the leader a chance to do his or her job. Coordination between the two flight leaders also makes possible rearranging more than one person’s workload in case that is the best solution. Choices (B) and (E) are both ineffective choices, but <span class="bold">choice (E) is the least effective</span> because it denies your flight leader the chance to do his or her job and manage your flight’s overall workload.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (A) is the most effective action</span>; using your initiative to work around problems is beneficial (the opposite of choice (E)). It’s important to make others involved fully aware of any potential challenges or problems (choices (B) and (C)), while making sure you are actually taking the most appropriate practical steps to prevent the problem from occurring. Telling the traveler that his request is impossible without even trying to arrange it <span class="bold">(choice (D)) is the least effective action</span>.</p>

Choice (E) puts the injured Airmen and the other two team members in unnecessary, possibly severe, danger by leaving this small element by itself with no guarantee of when help is going to arrive; it also unnecessarily increases the danger to the rest of the convoy by leaving it with two fewer Airmen. Likewise, just abandoning the damaged vehicle (choice (A)) is the same as donating it to the enemy, while calling the commander to ask for instructions (choice (B)) requires him to do his job and yours also&mdash;he will be informed of your status, and if he wants you to do something different, he will tell you.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (C) is the most effective action</span>, while <span class="bold">choice (E) is the least effective action</span> you can choose here, although choice (D) is a close second for the least effective option. When a junior service member says, “I have a problem,” it is vital, if there is any way possible, to stop and give that individual your full attention as his leader&mdash;solving problems is the leader’s job. This tells Airman Belton that he matters, that he is part of the team, and that team members help each other. What may seem like an obvious problem to an experienced person isn’t necessarily so obvious to an inexperienced individual. Although Airman Belton’s problem may seem funny or even ridiculous, you don’t laugh, and you make sure&mdash;nonverbal cues are important&mdash;that your tone of voice and facial expressions don’t convey contempt or disregard for Airman Belton. It’s acceptable to delay the full conversation for a short time to allow you to gather resources that will help him, but waiting till tomorrow (choice (A)) tells him that he is not important and that you are not interested in helping him solve his problem&mdash;plus, he could go somewhere else tonight, write some hot checks, and get into trouble. It’s also not a good idea to send him to someone else or call someone else over (choice (B)) to tell him or her about Airman Belton’s situation. Not only is it your job to help, but you are opening Airman Belton up to unnecessary embarrassment and even humiliation&mdash;not a good way to inspire loyalty, and it still doesn’t guarantee that the problem will be solved.</p>

Any organization is made up of people, and arguments due to individual instead of section focus mean time lost and performance reduced. Not getting involved ignores the problem, and isolating SSgt Nelson (choices (D) and (E)) may reduce day-to-day sparks, but it will probably make the problem worse in the long run. Asking the rest of the section to go along with her behavior (choice (C)) will only pour gas on the fire.</p>

Putting your weekend time in to help this team with their documentation sends a powerful message about maintaining standards and that you are more interested in results than recrimination.

SA Mitchell has in fact completed the tasks given to him for today, and, being brand new, is not aware of your extra emphasis on maintaining work hours. Choice (C) balances mission accomplishment (studying the material you gave him) with personal needs (the wedding) but informs him about unit standards in a timely manner. Choice (A) (and choice (D), for that matter) emphasize your power to keep him in the workplace, but without any particular reason. Choice (E) might be effective, but it would require your instructions to him about what to do in that early hour, and it would require someone else to come in early, too&mdash;again, without a particular associated benefit or need.</p>

Enforcing the section-wide requirement maintains standards and prevents degrading the workshop’s effectiveness, since <a id="calibre_link-3414" class="calibre3"></a>it’s hard to synchronize tasks with a team who isn’t there. Explaining the importance of the workshop and its benefit to the entire section enables the team leader to present the requirement to his team as if it was his own. Choice (E) is an arbitrary enforcement of your authority and presents a penalty for noncompliance that may be excessive&mdash;and, what’s more, could be prevented by a little reasoning with the team leader.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (A) is the most effective action</span>&mdash;if you don’t have the appropriate equipment to do your job, speaking to your first-line supervisor (who is responsible for seeing that you get your job done) is the right thing to do. <span class="bold">Choice (E) is the least effective action</span>, although the other remaining choices aren’t too far behind. Filing a complaint might be appropriate if your supervisor told you to shut up and deal with the situation, but it’s more appropriate (and usually more effective) to ask your question to successive levels of your chain of command rather than jumping all the way up to the base Inspector General. Asking for a transfer (choice (D)) is a permanent solution to a short-term problem that may not even exist, since it assumes (like choice (B)) that you are being treated unfairly without even asking. You may be next on the list to get a new system.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">The most effective action is choice (E)</span>, and <span class="bold">the least effective action is choice (C)</span>. Asking your coworker gives you a direct but non-confrontational option&mdash;for example, you might learn that the coworker you suspect may have actually started going to the gym after work&mdash;that goes directly to the issue at hand. Ignoring the problem does not resolve it, and it may continue indefinitely. Spying on your coworker (choice (B)) does not qualify as taking solution-oriented action, but it does qualify as wasting your own time&mdash;and if your suspicions are unfounded, maybe even a little creepy. Relaying your suspicions to your supervisor (choice (A)) leverages the chain of command, but you haven’t given your coworker the opportunity to even answer a question, much less explain. Asking your other coworkers if they have noticed anything suspicious lately (choice (D)) might uncover something, but it could start destructive rumors just as easily.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Choice (B) is the most effective action</span>, and <span class="bold">choice (E) is the least effective action</span> in this scenario. Since you have a different idea of the standard than your supervisor does, waiting a few days means you are in unknown territory until then, which puts you at risk of making the situation worse. Asking how you can do better is a good idea&mdash;remember, it is your supervisor who understands and must maintain performance standards, not you or your coworker. Arguing that your performance was acceptable without more information is unproductive at best, and doing it over email is even worse, since email is not a conversation and also denies you the nonverbal cues (as opposed to the face-to-face meeting) that can help you better understand your situation.</p>

The best outcome is to meet both deadlines with a quality product, and the worst outcome is to miss one or both deadlines, especially if the project owner doesn’t know your part will be late.

Choice (A) is the least effective action because, if you take this action, then you don’t communicate openly with your flight leader, but you do make him look bad and demonstrate your own unprofessional behavior (and possibly lack of understanding of the project) by going to his boss without consulting him.</p>

This effectively increases the wing camber or curvature, resulting in <span class="bold">increased lift and increased drag</span>; this allows the airplane to climb or descend at a steeper angle or a slower airspeed.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2824" href="#calibre_link-1314" class="calibre3">2</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> <span class="bold">Heavily loaded aircraft</span> are slower and therefore take longer to achieve flying speed, so a longer runway is needed to develop the lift required for takeoff. Also, a takeoff in <span class="bold">calm</span> or <span class="bold">nearly calm</span> air takes away the increased wind speed advantage derived from taking off into the wind. Therefore, many municipal or regional airports have a longer runway to accommodate airplanes needing a longer takeoff roll because of one or both of these conditions.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2825" href="#calibre_link-1315" class="calibre3">3</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> The small hinged section on the elevator of most airplanes is called the <span class="bold">trim tab</span>. The trim tab helps prevent or minimize pilot fatigue by relieving control pressure at the desired flight angle&mdash;in other words, the pilot does not have to spend physical and mental energy keeping the elevator at a certain angle to maintain a certain attitude (climbing, level flight, or diving).</p>

<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-2830" href="#calibre_link-1320" class="calibre3">8</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> The ramjet engine consists of <span class="bold">an inlet, a combustion zone, and a nozzle</span>. The ramjet does not have a compressor and turbine as the turbojet does. Air enters the inlet, where it is compressed; it then enters the combustion zone, where it is mixed with fuel and burned. The hot gases are then expelled through the nozzle, developing thrust. Ramjet operation depends on the inlet to decelerate the incoming air to increase the pressure in the combustion zone. The pressure increase makes it possible for the ramjet <a id="calibre_link-3421" class="calibre3"></a>to operate: The higher the velocity of the incoming air, the more the pressure increase. It is for this reason that the ramjet operates best at high supersonic velocities. At subsonic velocities, the ramjet is inefficient, and, to start the ramjet, air must first enter the inlet at a relatively high velocity.</p>

If the pilot wishes to <span class="italic">change</span> pitch or yaw, he uses the elevators and rudder, respectively.</p>

The four factors that affect density altitude are altitude, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature.</p>

Although this has been the widely accepted explanation for many years, emerging research is beginning to account for inconsistencies between theoretical and actual airfoil pressures and other performance results. However, the still widely recognized Venturi theory is correct in many major aspects and does accurately describe some airfoil performance characteristics.</p>

<p class="answ"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-4" href="#calibre_link-1333" class="calibre3">1</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> CROWDED is to URBAN as SPARSE is to <span class="bold">RURAL</span>. This can be viewed as an analogy of description or an analogy of association; an urban area can be described as crowded with people in the same way that a rural area has only a sparse amount of people. Stated another way, an urban area is commonly associated with being crowded, whereas a rural area is usually associated with being sparsely populated. Both descriptive words (adjectives) refer to the amount of people in a given area, but the other adjective choices (slower, industrial, calm) describe other possible conditions of an urban or rural area. A suburban area is another category altogether, in between urban and rural.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-5" href="#calibre_link-1334" class="calibre3">2</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> WATCH is to WATCHED as THROW is to <span class="bold">THREW</span>. This is an association of language; <span class="italic">watched</span> is the past tense of <span class="italic">watch</span>, so the correct choice to complete the analogy with <span class="italic">throw</span> is its past tense, <span class="italic">threw</span>. THROWED is not a standard conjugation of the verb <span class="italic">throw</span> (or <span class="italic">to throw</span>)&mdash;otherwise known as “improper English,” and therefore not a correct choice. <span class="italic">Thrown</span> is the past participle form of <span class="italic">throw</span>&mdash;it needs the auxiliary or helping verb <span class="italic">has</span> to be used properly. A <span class="italic">thrower</span> is the person who throws&mdash;not a form of the verb itself&mdash;and <span class="italic">tossed</span> is not a form of <span class="italic">throw</span> at all, just a word that is close in meaning.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-6" href="#calibre_link-1335" class="calibre3">3</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> WRENCH is to PLUMBER as HAMMER is to <span class="bold">CARPENTER</span>. This is a “tool to user” analogy. Pliers are the plumber’s primary tool in the same way that a hammer is one of the carpenter’s primary tools. A nail is used by a carpenter, but it becomes part of the structure the carpenter builds, as opposed to being a tool used on many different jobs. None of the other choices is a tool used by anyone.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-7" href="#calibre_link-1336" class="calibre3">4</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> NATURAL is to ARTIFICIAL as <span class="bold">CREATE is to DESTROY</span>. This is an analogy of language&mdash;in this case, we have opposites or antonyms. <span class="italic">Cook</span> to <span class="italic">waiter</span> is a relationship, but not one of opposites. <span class="italic">Birth</span> and <span class="italic">maturity</span> are at different places on the spectrum of age, but not completely opposite ends of that spectrum. <span class="italic">Cut</span> and <span class="italic">dissect</span> are basically synonyms, and a <span class="italic">tear</span> is partially made out of <span class="italic">water</span>, so they can’t be anything approaching opposites.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-8" href="#calibre_link-1337" class="calibre3">5</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> BACON is to PIGS as HAMBURGER is to <span class="bold">CATTLE</span>. This is a “part to whole” analogy. Bacon comes from pigs and hamburger comes from cows or cattle; both are a certain way to prepare meat from the source animal. <span class="italic">Veal</span> is a special kind of beef, coming as it does from young cows (i.e., calves). <span class="italic">Beef</span> is a general term for the meat that comes from <a id="calibre_link-3424" class="calibre3"></a>cattle; <span class="italic">fowl</span> is another word for birds (the implication is edible ones in this case); horses are animals, but are not normally used as a meat source.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-9" href="#calibre_link-1338" class="calibre3">6</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> KANGAROO is to POUCH as <span class="bold">BUTTERFLY is to COCOON</span>. This is an analogy of association, although it may seem to be a “part to whole”&mdash;the pouch and the cocoon are protective coverings that help the kangaroo and butterfly, respectively, to develop physically and mature. A <span class="italic">bear</span> can enter a <span class="italic">cave</span>, but the cave is a shelter or hiding place, not a covering. A <span class="italic">ball</span> can go into a <span class="italic">glove</span>, but this analogy is not equivalent because neither the ball nor the glove is living, and therefore the glove can’t be a developmental aid. The <span class="italic">web</span> is something made by the <span class="italic">spider</span> to catch its prey, and a <span class="italic">fish</span> can be a member of a <span class="italic">school</span>&mdash;but that’s a group, not a covering.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-10" href="#calibre_link-1339" class="calibre3">7</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> BEHAVE is to CANDY as DISOBEY is to <span class="bold">REPRIMAND</span>. This is an “action to result” analogy: if a child, for instance, behaves well, he or she may be rewarded with candy&mdash;whereas a child who disobeys will likely receive a reprimand. <span class="italic">Relinquish</span> means to let go of something, which doesn’t make sense as a result of disobedience. An <span class="italic">argument</span> may ensue if directions are disobeyed, but the weak correlation (i.e., relationship) between cause and effect (it may or may not happen, very uncertain) makes this answer not nearly as strong as reprimand; besides, the implication is strong in the first analogy of a parent- or adult-to-young-child relationship, which doesn’t really fit with the <span class="italic">argument</span> answer. <span class="italic">Dishonesty</span> and <span class="italic">disruption</span> may in fact be associated with disobedience, but there is again not nearly as clear a path of relationship as between disobey and reprimand.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-11" href="#calibre_link-1340" class="calibre3">8</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> XXII is to IXXX as 22 is to <span class="bold">29</span>. This is a very easy numerical or mathematical analogy; all we are really asked to do is reproduce the relationship of XXII (22) to IXXX (29) in Arabic numerals rather than Roman.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-12" href="#calibre_link-1341" class="calibre3">9</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> AMUSING is to FUNNY as ODD is to <span class="bold">UNUSUAL</span>. This is an association of language, since amusing and funny are basically synonyms. <span class="italic">Even</span> is an antonym (opposite) of odd, even though it is an opposite of a different meaning of odd. <span class="italic">Extra</span> is almost a synonym for yet another meaning of odd&mdash;as used in, “He picked up the odd scrap of bread here and there”; in this context, odd means <span class="italic">occasional</span> or <span class="italic">scattered</span>. <span class="italic">Fellow</span> has no relevant relationship to odd except as a distraction, because of the common phrase or cliché of <span class="italic">odd fellow</span>. <span class="italic">Distinct</span>, like <span class="italic">fellow</span>, is only a distracting filler choice&mdash;so don’t fall for it.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-13" href="#calibre_link-1342" class="calibre3">10</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> HONOR is to COURAGE as <span class="bold">SELFISHNESS is to GREED</span>. You can look at this analogy either as one of association or as “action to result”&mdash;when one has honor in one’s character, one is likely to exhibit courage; in the same way, when a person has selfishness as part of their internal makeup, they will probably show some degree of greed. <span class="italic">Light</span> and <span class="italic">darkness</span> are opposites, rather than such associated qualities as honor and courage. <span class="italic">Knowledge</span> and <span class="italic">wisdom</span> are without doubt associated qualities, but <span class="italic">knowledge</span> is not a character trait&mdash;it is something one either has or doesn’t. By the same token, <span class="italic">duty</span> is usually viewed as an externally imposed obligation; even if one feels <span class="italic">duty</span> to one’s <span class="italic">country</span>, that is the object of the obligation, not the external manifestation of the inner quality. And, of course, a <span class="italic">key</span> does go into an <span class="italic">ignition</span> to start a car, but these are inanimate objects, not qualities of living beings.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-14" href="#calibre_link-1343" class="calibre3">11</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> ATLANTA is to GEORGIA as DALLAS is to <span class="bold">TEXAS</span>. This is a geographical analogy (city-state/city-state); Atlanta is a very large metropolitan city in Georgia, just as Dallas is a very large metropolitan city in Texas. <span class="italic">Fort Worth</span> is another city in Texas, but this doesn’t <a id="calibre_link-3425" class="calibre3"></a>fit the city-state/city-state pattern; <span class="italic">Birmingham</span> is a large city in Alabama; <span class="italic">cowboys</span> (either the real kind or the football team) are associated with Dallas but don’t fit the pattern; and <span class="italic">Louisiana</span>, although adjacent to Texas, does not fit the pattern, either.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-15" href="#calibre_link-1344" class="calibre3">12</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> CLOCK is to WATCH as <span class="bold">LAKE is to POND</span>. This is an analogy of association; a clock is a larger version of a watch in much the same way that a lake is a larger version of a pond. <span class="italic">Stream</span> does not properly complete the analogy pattern, since it has a current and can be said to move “from” one place to another, whereas a <span class="italic">lake</span> does not have an appreciable current and stays in one place, so to speak. Viewed another way, a stream is a linear feature, whereas a lake is not; either way, <span class="italic">stream</span> is an incorrect choice. For much the same reasons, <span class="italic">ocean</span> and <span class="italic">river</span> are incorrect choices. <span class="italic">Water</span> and <span class="italic">fish</span> fit the pattern even less, since <span class="italic">fish</span> is either a verb or denotes a living thing&mdash;and <span class="italic">boat</span> and <span class="italic">sail</span> fit the pattern even more poorly (a <span class="italic">sail</span> is either part of a boat or it is a verb), even though they are associated terms.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-16" href="#calibre_link-1345" class="calibre3">13</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> STABLE is to HORSE as <span class="bold">HOUSE is to HUMAN</span>. This is an analogy of association; for the second pair, we are looking for something that is a dwelling place or shelter for a living thing. The only choice here that is even close is house and human. <span class="italic">Water</span> and <span class="italic">duck</span> are the closest contenders, but, although water is certainly associated with ducks, it is not a shelter or dwelling for them.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-17" href="#calibre_link-1346" class="calibre3">14</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> SQUIRREL is to TREE as GOPHER is to <span class="bold">GROUND</span>. Here we have yet another analogy of association; a squirrel lives in a tree, so we are looking for where in the wild a gopher lives.

In addition to the fact that this sentence discusses DoD (and therefore high-level) planning over the next five years, the word <span class="italic">strategic</span> usually means something at a high level, or with great impact, or both.</p>

The use of the word <span class="italic">back</span> clearly implies that people at least sometimes deviate from the path laid out by these values&mdash;you can’t go back to something if you haven’t left it.

The passage does not prioritize or say that one should strike a balance between the three core values mentioned, eliminating choices (B) and (E). The second bullet paragraph states that the core values “point to what is <span class="italic">universal</span> and <span class="italic">unchanging</span> in the profession of arms” [emphasis added], citing the values as road signs illuminating key features, but noting that they cannot “point to or pick out everything.” This eliminates the “specific standards and requirements” mentioned in choice (C).</p>

In physics, a vector has both a direction and a magnitude; in Air Force parlance, a vector is a direction of travel to reach a desired destination. It does not push&mdash;eliminating choice (A)&mdash;nor is it stationary like a standard, eliminating choice (C). The word’s usage implies a change of direction from the current one, ruling out choice (D), and choice (E) is the opposite of this word’s meaning in any context.</p>

<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-123" href="#calibre_link-1452" class="calibre3">20</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> <span class="normal">The passage’s author would likely agree with the following statement:</span> <span class="bold">“</span><span class="bold">The 15th Air Force made a major contribution in the Allied liberation of Italy.”</span> <span class="normal">The passage does not discuss the Allied landings at Normandy in France (choice (A)). The decrease in Axis oil production due to 15th Air Force bombing was in facilities in Romania, Silesia, and Poland, not southern Italy, thus eliminating choice (B). While the 15th Air Force’s role was important, its 23 months of regional operations in the 45 months of global war probably don’t qualify it as a “major” contributor to the overall Allied victory, ruling out choice (C). <a id="calibre_link-3442" class="calibre3"></a>Finally, there was no Allied</span><span class="normal"></span> <span class="normal">“reconquest” of Italy, as the Allies had not conquered it before and were only interested in defeating the expansionist Italian dictatorial government that was one of the Axis powers.</span></p>

The passage discusses SMCs as a category of colleges and universities that go beyond just having ROTC programs, and it gives some specific information about each school. The other choices are too specific to address the overall purpose of the passage.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-125" href="#calibre_link-1454" class="calibre3">22</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> In the first paragraph, the word “precommissioning” most nearly means <span class="bold">in preparation for being commissioned as an officer</span>. “Commissioning” is what happens when a student or cadet first becomes an officer, regardless of service. Choice (B) is both too narrow and too broad: it mentions only service in the Navy, not in the Army, and the naval service it mentions does not specify service as an officer. Receiving a security clearance is not a matter of training, but instead involves an outside agency evaluating an individual’s risk and reliability factors, ruling out choice (C). Neither choice (D) nor choice (E) addresses training that happens before a cadet becomes an officer.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-126" href="#calibre_link-1455" class="calibre3">23</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> From the information in the passage, you can infer that <span class="bold">some of the graduates from The Citadel may have fought in the Civil War</span>. Since The Citadel was established in 1842&mdash;19 years before the outbreak of the Civil War&mdash;its graduates would indeed have been likely to have been involved in Civil War campaigns. In fact, after it seceded, South Carolina even called The Citadel’s cadets into wartime service multiple times. Both Virginia Tech and Texas A&amp;M were established after the Civil War, eliminating choices (A) and (C). The University of North Georgia only has Army ROTC, thereby making it unlikely that any future admirals are there right now, so you can rule out choice (D). The passage specifically mentions that many SMC alumni did not graduate because service in wartime interrupted their enrollment, and that some did not return, so choice (E) is incorrect.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-127" href="#calibre_link-1456" class="calibre3">24</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> According to the passage, the following statement is not true: <span class="bold">“The SMCs focus more on military excellence and precommissioning training than on academic programs.”</span> The passage specifically states that the SMCs share a dedication to academic excellence and supports that statement with information about high academic rankings for some SMCs. The other choices are statements that are all specifically mentioned in the passage.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-128" href="#calibre_link-1457" class="calibre3">25</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> The author would most likely agree with the following statement: <span class="bold">“The benefits of the SMCs more than compensate for the extra investment they require.”</span> The writer of the passage offers many examples of high standards and high academic rankings for the SMCs as well as high accomplishments by their alumni&mdash;the apparently disproportionate number of generals, admirals, and Medal of Honor winners, for example. The overall tone of the passage does not support the statements in choices (A), (B), and (D). The passage specifically mentions the high academic rankings for several SMCs, refuting choice (E).</p>

Respectfully asking your supervisor in person how he thinks you are doing, while expressing gratitude for his extra coaching during the first few months, will give you useful feedback, regardless of how he answers. It also <a id="calibre_link-3445" class="calibre3"></a>has the advantages of being clear and direct. If he expresses an increasing level of satisfaction, it will open the door for you to ask for more elbow room, and it doesn’t present you as a know-it-all. Sending an e-mail is acceptable for short, factual messages or things that have to be communicated to many people at once. However, since this is a <span class="italic">relationship</span> question, it deserves a face-to-face meeting that directly addresses your desire for looser supervision&mdash;and gets you feedback, which is always beneficial whether you like it or not.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Choice (C) is the most helpful way</span> to meet section deadlines, and <span class="bold">choice (E) is the least helpful or effective way</span>. Scheduling work assignments transparently&mdash;where everyone has visibility not only of tasks, but also of progress and deadlines&mdash;and having the team leaders keep you regularly updated would be the best way to handle things, even if everyone was new to each other; it will be even more effective in this environment. Sending e-mail deadline reminders as your primary method of leadership and management would waste the advantage of the good personal relationships you already have, and it would also undercut the subordinate team leaders (also a problem with choice (B)).</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Choice (C) is the most effective action</span> in this scenario, and <span class="bold">choice (A) is the least effective action</span>. Although it’s clear that firm enforcement will be necessary to meet the standard, weapons this bad will take some time to clean properly, so another inspection at 1700 or even 1800 will likely not be productive. By the same token, just talking about the importance of clean weapons with no follow-through will not likely be productive, either.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Choice (D) is the most effective action</span> here, and <span class="bold">the least effective action is choice (A)</span>. Choice (D) shows your supervisor that you are paying attention to the situation as it changes and that you can see how it will affect your unit’s scheduled tasks, and it demonstrates initiative on your part by offering to finish the project on your own. It also allows your supervisor to do his or her job, which is to manage your unit’s projects and make decisions about how to allocate resources&mdash;which choice (C) does not allow since you would inappropriately bypass your supervisor to work directly with the “customer” unit. Choice (B) is the next most effective action, but it does not show any willingness on your part to do more than the minimum requirements. Choices (E) and (A) are successively less positive choices, as they demonstrate a bigger deficit in initiative and willingness to work hard on your part.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><div class="pgb"></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Choice (D) is the most effective action</span>, while <span class="bold">choice (C) is the least effective action</span>. You have two major managerial tasks here: use the experience and supervisory skills of your team leaders, and get the whole section enthusiastic about the project. You do this by first meeting with the team leaders to rough out the plan, and then meeting with the entire section to ensure that everyone understands the project’s full scope, importance, and impact. Only then can you turn it back over to the team leaders to keep track of their team’s tasks, making sure that the appropriate type and amount of progress is being made. Taking it all on yourself and leaving the “less important” routine tasks to your subordinates cuts your team leaders out of the loop and tells them that you don’t trust them&mdash;and it will probably overload what you can reliably accomplish. While choice (C) is in fact the worst option, any option that bypasses the team leaders or doesn’t help the section understand the importance of the project is not destined for success either.</p>

By upholding the standard but offering to help MSgt. McCann brush up on his skills, you have balanced two strong but competing forces pulling you in different directions.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this situation, <span class="bold">choice (B) is the most effective action</span>, although parts of choices (C) and (D) may have merit. <span class="bold">Choice (E) is the least effective action</span>, although choice (A) is not far behind in lack of wisdom. In any problem or challenge, you should first seek to understand not only what the problem is, but what is causing it&mdash;hence your discussion with the two team members who are having difficulties. Only then can you realistically hope to come up with <a id="calibre_link-3446" class="calibre3"></a>an effective action plan; the actions in choices (C) and (D) may be part of that action plan, but they are not solutions by themselves. Likewise, asking for an extension of the project deadline when you haven’t found out what’s causing the delay&mdash;much less taken any actions to solve the problem at your level, with your resources, and still on time&mdash;does not address your obligation to solve things at your level when possible.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">The most effective action is choice (A)</span>, and <span class="bold">the least effective action is choice (C)</span>. If the disruption was less than what is described here, it might be best to talk to the individual privately. However, if the disruption is keeping the meeting from accomplishing its purpose, direct action&mdash;although still professional&mdash;is justified. Leaving the disruptor alone would not solve the problem and would probably encourage continuation. Telling your supervisor implies not taking action during the meeting, and, unless you and the disruptor work for the same supervisor, wastes your supervisor’s time. Telling the disruptive individual’s supervisor again implies action after the fact and could very well be perceived as grade school tattling.</p>

Using your chain of command, with documentation of the necessary changes in hand, is the right way to address this issue and possibly become part of the solution. Bypassing your supervisor and announcing the problem outside your unit is neither wise nor your responsibility, and it will reflect poorly on you, your supervisor, and your unit. However, if addressed correctly, and if your supervisor is a good leader, she may even put a positive spotlight on you when she tells her supervisor and the rest of your unit that procedures have to change.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Dealing with other cultures in joint (multi-national) situations is often tricky, especially for U.S. personnel without much experience in doing so. Here, <span class="bold">the best action is likely choice (E)</span>, and <span class="bold">the least effective action is certainly choice (D)</span>, although choices (A), (B), and (C) are also pretty bad options. Many cultures place very high importance on maintaining their dignity and not being embarrassed, and sensitivities to criticism can be further aggravated by U.S. forces having visibly more resources or the like. “Just feedback” or “constructive criticism” can be perceived as a serious insult with long-lasting international implications. Chances are that the partner nation guard force commander knows about the lapses and is frustrated by them. Offering a face-saving way to provide U.S. help, without creating a “know-it-all U.S. big brother helping out the poor incompetent partner nation little brother” impression, can be a workable solution for all concerned.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Choice (A) is the most effective action</span> in this situation, since problems should be solved as directly as possible and at the lowest level possible. <span class="bold">Choice (D) is the least effective action</span> of the actions listed because it does nothing and assumes that the problem will go away on its <a id="calibre_link-3447" class="calibre3"></a>own&mdash;never a good idea. However, choice (C) is almost as bad since you don’t approach your colleague directly to discuss the situation before bringing it up to a supervisory level&mdash;there’s almost always some part of the situation you don’t know about, and you are likely to both build ill will and pick up a reputation as a backstabber.</p>

Using the planks to distribute your weight balances speed (remember, you have to guide ammunition and resupply back to your unit as soon as possible) with mitigating the risk of the ice breaking. Walking slowly and running rapidly are both great ways to break through the ice, and seeing how deep the stream is doesn’t really matter&mdash;it’s how thick the ice is that matters. Likewise, walking two miles downstream to the bridge is the worst option because it reduces your risk but almost certainly means that other members of your unit will die because you took so long to get the ammunition and medical resupply back to them.</p>

An after-action review (AAR) is a forum where even the most junior person can respectfully express his or her opinion about the conduct of an exercise or event. No one gets better without feedback&mdash;if the class was substandard, the section leader needs to know it. If the criticism was unfounded, misdirected, or otherwise not completely valid, the people offering those opinions should have the opportunity to come to that understanding themselves.</p>

Discussing your concerns with your coworker as a first step is a good idea because you have knowledge of your friend/coworker’s situation, and you may be able to offer a more objective perspective. Choice (D) is not a bad choice, but it shouldn’t be the first step&mdash;your friend/coworker may have already talked with a financial consultant or with one of the various military financial counseling resources. Lending him money (choice (A)) is certainly not the first step&mdash;he hasn’t asked, and it won’t solve his problem. Choice (E) is not a good idea because it is meddling too far into a private situation, but it is not as bad as choice (C), which makes what is, after all, your coworker’s issue visible to the chain of command before your coworker has a chance to solve it himself.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Choice (C) is the most effective action</span> in this situation, and <span class="bold">choice (B) is the least effective action</span>. Direct, respectful communication is almost always the answer if it is not bypassing levels of the chain of command.

Again, direct but respectful conversation at the lowest level possible to address the issue is the preferred course of action. Choices (C) and (E) are not only unlikely to succeed, but both will make you look like a know-it-all or worse to either your supervisor or to the rest of the team. Choice (B), however, makes you appear to be the opposite of a team player as well as a know-it-all to both your teammates and the next two levels up at the same time.</p>

You should have had a face-to-face meeting, laying out your expectations, soon after her assignment, but it’s never too late to start doing the right thing. If she straightens up and performs better&mdash;even if it takes a while and much effort&mdash;your section will gain a valuable member; if she doesn’t perform better, you will have a written basis to request her transfer or recommend other action. Supporting her school attendance may get her out of your hair, but she will then be inflicted on another unit at a higher level than she is now&mdash;and you will have failed by intentionally avoiding your responsibilities as a leader. Although it’s not the absolute worst possible choice of those presented, copying a subordinate on a negative e-mail message to your leadership, especially without an explanation or a prior discussion, is highly unprofessional. This kind of discussion must be face-to-face, both with your flight leader and with your assistant section leader.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">The most effective action is choice (C)</span>, and <span class="bold">the least effective action is choice (D)</span>. While it’s important to maintain standards and the flow of the chain of command, if that section leader went around you to the squadron commander, he apparently feels pretty strongly about his objections. You need to understand why this experienced NCO went around you (he knows better), and you also need to consider whether your leadership or communication style or other attributes are contributing to the objections. It’s very seldom necessary (and often counterproductive) to hammer down objections or point out procedural fouls in a group setting, and firing an NCO is something that should only be done after a series of documented, unresolved issues, and only after consultation with your boss.</p>

By prioritizing something that greatly affects the entire headquarters ahead of your other tasks, you are being a team player. By going over your thoughts on it with your supervisor, you are not only multiplying the quality that your section adds to the order, but you are also demonstrating your trust in and support of your chain of command, which will be reciprocated. Pushing the task off until the end of the day&mdash;when you are no longer at your best and when you may not get to it at all&mdash;puts your individual tasks above something that greatly affects the whole headquarters, which is inappropriate at best. Being afraid to take a swing at it because you might miss something misses the opportunity for both you and the order to be improved.</p>

Ideally, you would want to reinforce the chain of command&mdash;as well as training your team leaders&mdash;by finding the team leader and having him make the correction. However, since this is a safety situation, and the Airman might be hurt while you are looking for the team leader, you need to make an on-the-spot correction. Sending an e-mail to the whole section does not solve the immediate problem, does not reinforce the chain of command, and will possibly be ignored.</p>

As section leader, you are responsible for both accomplishing the mission and taking care of your people&mdash;this includes prioritizing their work, setting deadlines, and checking results. Major deficiencies, by definition, are more important than minor deficiencies&mdash;but the fact of the matter is that you will have to address both at the same time to some extent. You may want to prioritize working on deficiencies related to safety and readiness above other areas, or you may not, depending on the details&mdash;but you are responsible for the results. Don’t confuse results with “making progress” or “making an effort.”</p>

Unit cohesion and loyalty are important and can be reinforced by overcoming obstacles together. Avoidance of hardship or challenges should not be rewarded with easier duties or a three-day pass just to hide these three below-average physical specimens for the purposes of the competition. The leader is responsible for communicating his or her vision of where the unit needs to go to its members and for getting their buy-in when possible. The leader is also responsible for setting and enforcing standards&mdash;and once you make one exception, especially to “game” a competitive result, you are sliding off that mountain at high speed.</p>

<p class="answ"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-154" href="#calibre_link-1483" class="calibre3">1</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> The most accurate description of Earth’s atmosphere is that it is made up of <span class="bold">21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, .03% carbon dioxide, trace amounts of rare gases, water vapor, and some dust particles</span>.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-155" href="#calibre_link-1484" class="calibre3">2</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> Since sound consists of vibrations passed through a medium such as air, in an environment where there is nothing to transmit the sound there will be no sound&mdash;so the tuning fork will <span class="bold">be inaudible</span>.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-156" href="#calibre_link-1485" class="calibre3">3</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> Most plants need <span class="bold">nitrogen</span>; they also need <span class="bold">phosphorus and potassium</span>. Plants need only traces of other elements, so they are not a priority for companies that produce fertilizers.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-157" href="#calibre_link-1486" class="calibre3">4</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> The barometric pressure at a particular location directly depends on <span class="bold">its temperature and humidity</span>. Solar flares and wind speed have nothing to do with barometric pressure.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-158" href="#calibre_link-1487" class="calibre3">5</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> “Dry ice” is solid carbon dioxide (<span class="bold">CO</span><span class="bold"><sub class="sub1">2</sub></span>), made by cooling this gas to &ndash;80 degrees Celsius. In this case, CO<sub class="sub1">2</sub> goes directly from a gaseous state to a solid&mdash;and then, when it warms above the temperature needed to keep it a solid, it goes directly back to a gas.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><a id="calibre_link-3451" class="calibre3"></a><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-159" href="#calibre_link-1488" class="calibre3">6</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> An airplane wing is curved on the top and relatively flat on the bottom (this shape is called an airfoil). Because nature avoids having a vacuum whenever possible (the cliché is that “nature abhors a vacuum”), air flowing over the top surface is forced to flow faster over the top of the wing than under the bottom surface to avoid having a partial vacuum at the trailing (back) edge of the wing. This faster-flowing air results in less air pressure on the top surface of the wing than underneath. The scientific principle behind this was first described by Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700&ndash;1782): in any flowing fluid, as the speed of the fluid becomes greater, the pressure becomes less.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-160" href="#calibre_link-1489" class="calibre3">7</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> Radio waves and visible light waves are two forms of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, they have the same <span class="bold">speed</span> as all electromagnetic waves in a vacuum&mdash;that is, the speed of light.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-161" href="#calibre_link-1490" class="calibre3">8</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> Inertia is the property of matter to <span class="bold">resist a change of position or motion</span>. This is addressed by Newton’s First Law of Motion, which states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion (at the same speed and in the same direction) unless acted on by an unbalanced force.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-162" href="#calibre_link-1491" class="calibre3">9</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> The density of a substance is determined by <span class="bold">dividing its mass by its volume</span>. For any particular substance, there’s a linear relationship between its mass and its volume: when one increases, so does the other, and vice versa.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-163" href="#calibre_link-1492" class="calibre3">10</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> Parallel light rays each strike the mirror at a different point. Because the mirror has a plane (flat) surface, the rays are still <span class="bold">parallel</span> after reflection.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-164" href="#calibre_link-1493" class="calibre3">11</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> All freely falling objects, regardless of their mass, fall toward Earth with equal acceleration. Any two objects that begin to fall at the same instant will have equal velocities at the end of four seconds, or at any other time interval. Therefore, the ratio of their speeds will be <span class="bold">1:1</span>.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-165" href="#calibre_link-1494" class="calibre3">12</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> On the basis of their atomic structure, atoms are considered <span class="bold">metals</span> if they can lend electrons and <span class="bold">nonmetals</span> if they borrow electrons. The periodic table is organized so that elements with similar chemical and physical properties are aligned in columns or groups. Metals that form the left-hand two-thirds of the periodic table tend to form compounds by losing or “lending” electrons.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-166" href="#calibre_link-1495" class="calibre3">13</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons. Neutral atoms have the same number of <span class="bold">electrons and protons</span> (protons are inside the atom’s nucleus, and electrons are outside of it). Atoms of the same element may differ in the number of neutrons.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-167" href="#calibre_link-1496" class="calibre3">14</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> <span class="bold">Soil</span> is eroded by the action of wind, water, and ice; it can also be depleted by the removal of organic matter or minerals.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-168" href="#calibre_link-1497" class="calibre3">15</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> An insulator is a material that has tightly held electrons and very <span class="bold">few</span> (if any) <span class="bold">free electrons</span>. This means that it can be used to protect the conductor, since the insulator will not allow free electrons from the conductor to knock loose any tightly held electrons of the insulator material.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-169" href="#calibre_link-1498" class="calibre3">16</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> Combustion (<span class="bold">burning</span>) is a chemical process; the others listed are not.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-170" href="#calibre_link-1499" class="calibre3">17</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> A seesaw is an example of <span class="bold">a</span> <span class="bold">lever</span>. Specifically, a seesaw is an example of a first-class lever, where the fulcrum is placed between the applied force and the load. Which end has the load <a id="calibre_link-3452" class="calibre3"></a>and which end has the applied force changes as each person alternates using their legs to push off from the ground.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-171" href="#calibre_link-1500" class="calibre3">18</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> The <span class="bold">electron</span> is the negatively charged particle that circles the nucleus of an atom. A <span class="italic">neutron</span> is neutral (has no charge), and a <span class="italic">proton</span> is positively charged; a <span class="italic">meson</span> has both positive and negative charges. An <span class="italic">isotope</span> is an atom of the same element that has a different number of neutrons.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-172" href="#calibre_link-1501" class="calibre3">19</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> Light travels in a vacuum at 186,282 miles per second, and Earth is 92,955,807 miles from the sun. This means that light from the sun reaches Earth in about <span class="bold">eight minutes</span> and 19 seconds. (Even if you rounded off the speed of light to 186,000 mps and the Earth&ndash;sun distance to 93,000,000 miles, the result would be only one second different&mdash;eight minutes and 20 seconds.)</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-173" href="#calibre_link-1502" class="calibre3">20</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> A liquid has <span class="bold">definite volume</span>, and <span class="bold">takes the shape of its container</span>.</p>

<p class="answ"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-245" href="#calibre_link-1574" class="calibre3">1</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> In a level turn, the acceleration experienced by the aircraft and its pilot in the direction perpendicular to the wing is solely determined by the <span class="bold">bank angle</span>. Regardless of the aircraft type, its altitude, the density of the air, the temperature, or any other factor, the G-load (or load factor) experienced by the aircraft and pilot is related only to the bank angle. A Cessna 150 at 100 knots in a 60° bank will experience two Gs (twice the force of normal Earth gravity), just as an F-16 will at 500 knots at the same bank angle.</p>

<p class="image1"><img src="images/01802.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre25" /></p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-248" href="#calibre_link-1577" class="calibre3">4</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> The straight line joining the ends of the mean camber line is called the <span class="bold">wing chord</span>.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-249" href="#calibre_link-1578" class="calibre3">5</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> An <span class="bold">aerodynamic stall</span> is the point at which the airflow over the wings ceases to be a smooth (laminar) flow and the wing starts to lose lift.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-250" href="#calibre_link-1579" class="calibre3">6</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> The two basic types of drag are <span class="bold">parasitic drag and induced drag</span>. Parasitic drag is the resistance of the aircraft to the air through which it moves; it increases with the square of the object’s speed through the air. The second basic type of drag is called induced drag; it’s related to the wing’s production of lift. At low airspeed and high angles of attack, induced drag increases and becomes a large factor.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-251" href="#calibre_link-1580" class="calibre3">7</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> An airfoil’s efficiency, either a wing or a rotor blade, is <span class="bold">decreased</span> at high altitudes by the <span class="bold">lesser</span> air density.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-252" href="#calibre_link-1581" class="calibre3">8</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> The degree of movement of an aircraft around its lateral axis is known as <span class="bold">pitch</span>.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="tcn"><a id="calibre_link-253" href="#calibre_link-1582" class="calibre3">9</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> When the flaps are extended, the camber of the wing is <span class="bold">increased</span>. Effectively, the wing becomes larger and more curved. The flaps, mounted inboard of the ailerons, are probably the most commonly used lift device. They increase the lift capability of the airfoil <a id="calibre_link-3455" class="calibre3"></a>(wing) to its maximum potential, which means an aircraft can become or remain airborne at lower speeds. They also permit a shorter ground roll on landing when used as airbrakes.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-254" href="#calibre_link-1583" class="calibre3">10</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> A helicopter’s cyclic control is a mechanical linkage used to change the pitch of the main rotor blades <span class="bold">at a selected point in its circular pathway</span>. For instance, if the pilot adjusts the cyclic pitch so that the rotor blades have more “bite” into the air (i.e., more lift) when they pass over the tail than when they pass over the nose of the helicopter, the aircraft travels forward.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-255" href="#calibre_link-1584" class="calibre3">11</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(D)</span> When the rotor blades of a helicopter are spinning fast enough in a clockwise direction to generate lift, a phenomenon known as <span class="bold">torque</span> causes the body of the helicopter to have a tendency to turn in a counterclockwise direction.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-256" href="#calibre_link-1585" class="calibre3">12</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(E)</span> Pulling back (toward the pilot) on the control column or joystick of a fixed-wing aircraft will cause the aircraft to <span class="bold">pitch up</span>, that is, for the nose to rise.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-257" href="#calibre_link-1586" class="calibre3">13</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(B)</span> Contra-rotating propellers, a complex way of applying the maximum power of a single piston or turboprop aircraft engine, uses two propellers <span class="bold">rotating in opposite directions arranged one behind the other</span>. Power is transferred from the engine via a planetary gear transmission. When airspeed is low, the air mass going back through the propeller disk (thrust) causes a significant amount of tangential or rotational airflow to be created by the spinning blades; the energy of this tangential airflow is wasted in a single-propeller design. To use this wasted resource, the placement of a second propeller behind the first takes advantage of the already-disturbed airflow.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-258" href="#calibre_link-1587" class="calibre3">14</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> The abbreviation VTOL, applied to aircraft other than helicopters, means <span class="bold">Vertical Take-Off and Landing</span>.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-259" href="#calibre_link-1588" class="calibre3">15</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(C)</span> Delta wing aircraft have a wing in the form of a triangle, named after the Greek uppercase letter delta (Δ) and no <span class="bold">horizontal stabilizer</span>. The primary advantage of this design is that the wing’s leading edge remains behind the shock wave generated by the aircraft’s nose when flying at supersonic speeds, which is an improvement on traditional wing designs.</p>
<div class="calibre4"></div><p class="answpg"><span class="alp"><a id="calibre_link-260" href="#calibre_link-1589" class="calibre3">16</a>.</span> <span class="bold">(A)</span> The Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) is a system of lights designed to provide visual descent guidance information during a runway approach. The system uses <span class="bold">red</span> lights to indicate the upper limits of the glide path and <span class="bold">white</span> lights for the lower limits. It is visible from 3&ndash;5 miles during the day and up to 20 miles or more at night. The visual glide path of the VASI provides safe obstruction clearance within ±10 degrees of the extended runway centerline and to 4 nautical miles from the runway threshold.</p>

The “torque effect” is caused by the rotation of the main rotors, which gives the fuselage the tendency to rotate in the direction opposite that of the main rotor. The tail rotor counteracts the torque effect and pulls or pushes the tail in the direction opposite that of the rotors. In American helicopters where the main rotors rotate in a counterclockwise direction, the tendency is for the tail to spin around in a clockwise direction; the tail rotor either pulls or pushes the tail against that tendency.</p>

Apply up-collective pitch and apply pedal to maintain heading. As the downslope skid rises and the helicopter approaches a level attitude, move the cyclic stick back to the neutral position and take the helicopter straight up to a hover before moving away from the slope. The tail should not be turned upslope because of the danger of the tail rotor striking the surface.</p>

Okay, but thinking of all those numbers along a number line, if we move inward and add the next pair of “first and last,” 2 and 999, we still get 1,001.

Certain airfoils, such as rotor blades, combine some of these functions.

In some conditions, parts of the fuselage, such as the vertical and horizontal stabilizers, can become airfoils.</p>

As the blades cone upward, the center of pressures of the blades are almost in the same plane as the hub. Whatever stresses are remaining bend the blades for compliance.

Airspeed is the <a id="calibre_link-3494" class="calibre3"></a>speed at which a helicopter moves through the atmosphere and is unaffected by wind. Atmospheric wind affects only the groundspeed, or speed at which the helicopter is moving over Earth’s surface. Humidity alone is usually not considered an important factor in calculating density altitude and helicopter performance, but it does contribute. There are no rules of thumb used to compute the effects of humidity on density altitude, but some manufacturers include charts with 80 percent relative humidity columns as additional information. There appears to be an approximately 3&ndash;4 percent reduction in performance compared with dry air at the same altitude and temperature; it’s reasonable to expect a decrease in hovering and takeoff performance in high-humidity conditions. Although 3&ndash;4 percent may seem insignificant, it can cause an accident when the helicopter is operating at the edge of its performance envelope. Additionally, at higher gross weights, the increased power required to hover produces more torque, which means more antitorque thrust is required. In some helicopters during high-altitude operations, the maximum antitorque produced by the tail rotor during a hover may not be sufficient to overcome torque even if the gross weight is within limits.</p>

This is <span class="italic">implied</span> because the writer dwells on how the individuals who make up both active and reserve forces are different; therefore, if the people recruited are significantly different&mdash;if they “both are and are not the stuff of which legions were once made,” we may reasonably infer or deduce that recruiting methods are different. Although both the American military and American culture have, in fact, changed a great deal since WWII, the writer does not address American culture, and no inference is therefore possible.</p>

Wallenberg was in fact made an honorary American citizen in 1981 in an effort to resolve his status&mdash;but this was not mentioned in the passage. Soviet Army prisoner records may or may not have been classified, but the passage does not address this even by implication&mdash;and he would have been handed over to other, non-Army, Soviet authorities if he had in fact been sent to the Gulag archipelago and its infamous camps. Wallenberg was not in fact Jewish, nor did he have Hungarian relatives. He had, however, been an apprentice to a Hungarian Jewish import/export business owner in Sweden in 1936; when his boss found it too difficult to travel to Hungary, Wallenberg was given the reins of the firm’s foreign division.</p>

India was a British colony&mdash;not ally&mdash;at the time. Nowhere in the passage does it mention who Kipling’s father (most married women did not work at this time) worked for; in fact, he was an art teacher, illustrator, and museum curator.</p>

The writer says that “ ‘just showing up’ is <span class="italic">sometimes claimed</span> to be the majority of success”&mdash;which doesn’t sound like the writer agrees. Since the passage emphasizes the amount of effort needed to achieve excellent results&mdash;especially by quoting the maxim that “Nothing worthwhile is ever easy”&mdash;it does not follow that success has come easily to him or that he likes people who achieve things easily; probably just the opposite. The fact that the writer uses a metaphor of building a “monument to accomplishment” does not necessarily point to him being an architect or builder; he did not use specialized or technical terms indicating a high level of professional knowledge, and the building metaphor was only used toward the end of the passage.</p>

<p class="centern">50 + 50 = 100 degrees</p>
<p class="answ">To find the measure of the third angle, subtract 100 from 180, which is the total of the measures of the angles of any triangle:</p>

<p class="answ">Next, find the square footage of two of the facing or opposite walls&mdash;let’s start with the walls formed by the room’s length and height:</p>

So here we see that after one hour, Pump 1 by itself would have emptied 1/6 of the holding tank, and Pump 2 would have emptied 1/4 of it. However, since we are asked to find out how long it will take both pumps working together, let’s see how much of the tank the two pumps working together will have emptied after an hour:</p>
<p class="centern">Pump 1 = 1/6</p>
<p class="centern">Pump 2 = 1/4</p>

<p class="centern">Pump 1 = 2/12</p>

<p class="centern">After 1 hour = 5/12</p>
<p class="answ">Now for the second principle needed to solve this problem: If <span class="italic">x/y</span> of a task can be completed in one unit of time, then the completion of the entire task will take the reciprocal of the original fraction. That means that it will take 12/5 hours for both pumps to empty the tank&mdash;but we are asked for the answer in minutes, so we multiply by the 60 minutes in an hour:</p>
<p class="centern">12/5 × 60 = 720/5 = <span class="bold">144</span> minutes</p>

The good part about this is that we can pick a size, work things out, and in doing so come to understand the principles involved. So, if the sides of our first cube are 2 units long, the length of the second cube’s sides will be 4 units. Since the formula for the volume of a cube is simply the cube (<span class="italic">x</span><span class="sup">3</span>) of the length of the sides, the volume of the first cube will be 8 (2 × 2 × 2) cubic units, and the volume of the second cube will be 64 (4 × 4 × 4) cubic units&mdash;a ratio of 8 : 64 or 1 : 8 (if you want to have even more confidence that you are on the right track, pick another value for the length of the sides of the original cube and work things through again to confirm). This means that, since weight is proportional to volume, the weight of the second cube will be 5 × 8 = <span class="bold">40</span> lbs.</p>

Next, determine the amount of change in the aircraft part of the ratio:</p>
<p class="centern">1.737 &ndash; 0.514 = 1.223</p>
<p class="answ">Next, compare the difference to the 1950 number of aircraft and calculate it as a percentage; do this by using a proportion and cross-multiplying:</p>

<p class="answ">So, we see that even though there were nine times as many aircraft, it was still a <span class="italic">decrease</span> in the <span class="italic">ratio</span> of aviators to aircraft, because the number of aviators increased by more than 31 times. In other words, in 1950 there were almost two aircraft for every aviator, while in 1970 there were roughly two aviators for every aircraft.

The air flowing over the top of the wing has to go farther than the air underneath because it must meet again at the far side of the wing&mdash;physical laws act together to prevent or minimize vacuums in most cases. Because the air flowing over the top must go faster than that underneath, the pressure on the top of the wing is decreased, whereas the pressure underneath the wing remains relatively unchanged. Therefore, most of the lift on an aircraft’s wing is because of a decrease in pressure on the wing’s upper side.</p>
