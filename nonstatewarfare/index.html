<p class="co"><small class="calibre7"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2386">HOW DO MILITARIES FIGHT?</span></small><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2387"> What strategies, tactics, and operational methods will a given force employ in battle? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2388">A central theme in the last generation of research on military effectiveness has been the importance of nonmaterial variables for combat outcomes, and among the most important of these variables are the methods and behavior adopted by combatants on the battlefield.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2389">The methods of nonstate actors in particular warrant special attention. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2390">Nonstate fighters are widely expected to adopt a distinct military style very different from that of state armies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2391">Whereas interstate warfare is widely expected to feature uniformed, heavily armed formations employing massed firepower to destroy one another as a means to take and hold ground, nonstate actors are expected to wage irregular warfare using lethal but militarily unsophisticated “asymmetric” means such as suicide vests, roadside bombs, snipers, assassinations, and car bombings; to seek out densely populated areas and to intermingle indistinguishably with civilian communities; and to combine these tactics with sophisticated information strategies using the internet and transnational cable news networks to influence world and regional opinion rather than taking and holding ground or seeking decisive battle.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2392">This expected difference in methods underpins a widespread assumption that state and nonstate warfare are profoundly different phenomena with fundamentally divergent requirements for success. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2393">The category error of treating an internal war like an interstate conflict is often blamed for American defeat in Vietnam and the more recent struggles of the US military in Iraq. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2394">A generation of US military modernization, force design, doctrine development, and training after 2001 focused heavily on reorienting US forces away from the perceived needs of interstate war and toward those of intrastate conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2395">Academic research on civil warfare has expanded dramatically since 2001, creating a sub-subfield whose distinctiveness lies in the expectation that civil war is different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2396">At the heart of this categorical distinction is an assumed difference in military methods: if state and nonstate actors fought about the same way, </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-593" aria-label="xvi" title="xvi" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2397">the same military policies would mostly suit either conflict type, and academic studies of civil war would be based on a distinction without a difference.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2398">Yet this assumed distinction is overstated at best. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2399">Some nonstate actors do use methods similar to the standard assumption, but many do not, and almost none follow the expected playbook in all its particulars. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2400">The more closely one studies the actual behavior of nonstate actors, the less clear the ostensible category distinction with state conventional war making becomes.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2401">In fact there is nothing intrinsic to state status in the conduct of war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2402">All combatants, whether states or not, must respond to a common set of incentives created ultimately by the nature of weapon technology. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2403">And since at least 1900, all sound war-fighting systems, whoever adopts them, have had to combine features commonly associated with both “conventional” and “irregular” warfare&mdash;the very categories themselves are artificial heuristics that appear in their pure form only as rare extrema on a continuous spectrum in which almost all real actors occupy points somewhere in the middle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2404">This does not mean the resulting differences of degree are unimportant&mdash;in fact they have major policy implications. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2405">But the range of typical variance is narrower, the differences that matter are subtler, the underlying similarities are more important than commonly supposed, and the policy implications that follow from this are different from those commonly assumed in the public debate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2406">To treat state and nonstate military methods using categorical distinctions of kind is an oversimplification with potentially serious consequences for policy and scholarship.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2407">This book is intended to explore these military methods in detail, to describe more carefully the differences of degree that distinguish the real battlefield behavior of state and nonstate militaries, and to explain the variations one observes when doing so. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2408">The explanation I propose focuses on differences in the internal political makeup of different nonstate actors&mdash;especially their varying internal institutions and perceived stakes in the wars they fight&mdash;as central causes of their observed behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2409">I contrast this political theory of nonstate military behavior with common alternative views that focus on nonstate material disadvantages or tribal culture, and I argue that internal politics, in interaction with the nature of available technology, offers a more successful explanation.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2410">I base this argument on a combination of deductive causal theory construction and a series of historical case studies of nonstate actors selected to enable the greatest possible theoretical leverage for distinguishing the competing accounts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2411">These case studies use a variety of evidence types but make particularly </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-2412" aria-label="xvii" title="xvii" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2413">extensive use of field research involving a total of 137 interviews with combatants and officials who either fought as members of a nonstate military or were in a position to observe directly the behavior of nonstate combatant foes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2414">These interviews enable the kind of detailed, in-depth, granular description of combat methods, battlefield events, and political details that I need to evaluate the theories under study here but which are often absent from secondary historical accounts.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2415">The book’s text presents my central ideas in natural language and is intended to be accessible to a wide range of audiences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2416">For the full technical details, however, specialists will want to consult the </span><a href="#calibre_link-73" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2417">appendix</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2418">, which formalizes the new theory’s causal claim in mathematical language, presents detailed criteria for coding independent and dependent variables empirically, and summarizes the theory’s comparative statics graphically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2419">Many readers will find the narrative presentation in the text sufficient, but the book is designed to enable those who want a more rigorous articulation to find this via the technical </span><a href="#calibre_link-73" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2420">appendix</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2421">.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2422">I am grateful for the assistance and support I have received from a great many people and organizations in developing this argument. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2423">I would particularly like to thank the Smith Richardson Foundation, which provided grant support; the Council on Foreign Relations, which supported the book’s early development and much of the travel that enabled its field research, and especially the war zone travel in Iraq and Afghanistan; the Multinational Force Iraq headquarters in Baghdad, which facilitated my travel and interviews in Iraq; the International Security Assistance Force headquarters in Kabul, which facilitated my travel in Afghanistan; the Dado Center for Interdisciplinary Military Studies in Tel Aviv, which facilitated my travel and interviews in Israel, and particularly its then commanding officer Brigadier General Itai Brun; the staff of the US Embassy in Zagreb who facilitated my travel and interviews in Croatia; the Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College, which provided funding for research travel in Israel under its External Research Associates Program; and the US Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, which facilitated interview access to US Army returnees from combat duty in Iraq. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2424">Richard Haass, James Lindsay, Amy Baker, Dominic Bocci, Patricia Dorff, and Natalia Cote-Munoz of the Council on Foreign Relations have been particularly instrumental in supporting the project intellectually and administratively.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2437">My daughter, Emmy Biddle, withstood long parental conversations about nonstate actors for many years and tolerated her father’s time away in Iraq and Afghanistan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2438">Her joyous greetings when I returned were the highlight of every trip.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2457">Whether this focus should continue has become one of the most important ongoing debates in US defense policy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2458">As the US role in Afghanistan and Iraq winds down, many would now shift emphasis away from nonstate enemies and civil wars and back toward the great power threats and interstate warfare that dominated military planning before 2001.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1124" href="#calibre_link-720" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2459">2</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2460"> Arguments for such a shift sometimes cite the rising importance of Russia or China, but many frame their case around the military difficulties of civil warfare against nonstate enemies&mdash;which they often see as insurmountable at a cost Americans will be willing to pay.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1125" href="#calibre_link-721" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2461">3</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2462"> Others, however, disagree, arguing that nonstate enemies in civil warfare will remain an important problem for the US military in the future and that the country cannot simply opt out of preparing to meet such challenges.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1126" href="#calibre_link-722" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2463">4</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2464"> Still others say critics overstate the difficulty of defeating nonstate foes, and that hard-earned lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq enable more effective counterinsurgency at a more manageable cost.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1127" href="#calibre_link-723" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2465">5</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2466"> And some argue that nonstate threats can be met with “balanced” forces not designed for a preclusive focus on civil warfare and counterinsurgency.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1128" href="#calibre_link-724" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2467">6</span></a></sup></p>

<p class="tni"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2646">The book seeks to explain the military behavior of nonstate actors in warfare involving numerically superior state opponents since 1900. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2647">Several of these terms require careful definition.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2648">First, by “nonstate actor” I mean any entity other than a sovereign state as defined in international law. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2649">The 1933 Montevideo Convention defines a sovereign state as an institution with “(a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other states.”</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1153" href="#calibre_link-745" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2650">31</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2651"> Hence nonstate actors would include, inter alia, insurgent groups; ethnic separatists; internationally unrecognized armed forces such as warlord militias; mercenaries or private military firms; armed religious or ideological extremists; criminal syndicates; or any other user of armed force other than Montevideo Convention states.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2732">The deductive argument below draws heavily on the experience of both state and nonstate militaries in modern war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2733">Indeed, one of my central claims is that the putative category distinction between the two is largely an illusion; to sustain this claim requires a sustained exploration of both. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2734">The tendency to separate interstate and nonstate warfare into distinct, stove-piped literatures is part of the reason for the widespread misunderstanding of these underlying commonalities: if one studies nonstate warfare by looking only at nonstate actors then its similarities with interstate combat will never be seen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2735">I argue that modern technology creates common military incentives that affect all actors alike&mdash;my theoretical discussion of these incentives thus makes extensive use of the modern military history of interstate as well as nonstate warfare, </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-677" aria-label="15" title="15" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2736">as a means of shedding unique light on the features of nonstate warfare per se. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2737">Strictly speaking my findings pertain to nonstate actors per se, but the deductive discussion draws heavily on observations of both.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2738">The result is a rationalist theory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2739">None of this means that warlord commanders are cool, emotionless, Enlightenment calculators who evaluate all options in the way Adam Smith or John Stuart Mill might have done, and choose the one best suited to their mathematical objective functions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2740">The causal mechanism here does assume, however, that the reality of warfare disciplines behavior by imposing disproportionate cost on those who make poor choices. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2741">War is an unforgiving enterprise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2742">Those who misunderstand its dynamics will be exploited by those with stronger perception, and the result will be destruction or defeat of the obtuse at the hands of the astute: selection effects will remove, through death or conquest, those who consistently choose badly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2743">In the crucible of war, trial and error will thus cause surviving combatants to vector in on something resembling the result of an objective calculation even if it never occurs to them as such. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2744">At any given time, some warriors will be in the process of elimination, hence not all will behave as a rationalist optimal behavior model would expect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2745">But if the theory below is sound, then in steady state, most combatants at most times will display behavioral choices that mirror those the logic below suggests are optimal&mdash;and those who do not should suffer for their failure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2746">The explicit calculations in the theory below thus short-circuit the process of experiential learning by real combatants in war, but they should predict about the same outcomes if the military logic below is correct.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1159" href="#calibre_link-678" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2747">37</span></a></sup></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2750">These case studies use a variety of sources but make particular use of field research involving a total of 137 structured interviews with state and nonstate participants in critically selected military campaigns. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2751">This field research was conducted in Iraq, Croatia, and Israel, and in the United States with participants who had returned from Iraq and Somalia. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2752">It included interviewees who either fought as nonstate combatants (in Croatia) or were in a position to observe directly the behavior of nonstate combatant foes (in Lebanon, Iraq, and Somalia), at military ranks from private to major general, and ambassadorial rank in the Department of State, and it enabled detailed, in-depth, granular description of combat methods, battlefield events, and political details important to the theories assessed here but absent from typical secondary historical accounts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2753">Throughout, military participants were asked to address only factual </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-2754" aria-label="16" title="16" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2755">events they observed themselves (or performed themselves); wherever possible, multiple participants’ accounts of the same events were solicited to insulate the findings against observer bias to the greatest degree possible.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1160" href="#calibre_link-751" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2756">38</span></a></sup></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2762">This depth of detail, however, makes it impossible to consider more than a handful of cases. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2763">No such sample can exhaust the range of possible empirical variation, especially for a theory whose dependent variable (and some independent variables) are continuous and real-valued. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2764">For a theory specified in continuous variables, there is literally an infinite number of points that make up the relevant theoretical space&mdash;this cannot be exhaustively surveyed to see whether prediction and observation match at each possible point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2765">Nor could even the largest plausible large-</span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2766">n</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2767"> data set accomplish this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2768">To test the theory here thus requires some act of selection to create a sample of observations chosen to create the greatest possible leverage for evaluating the theory given the scale of research needed to characterize fully all the relevant variables for any given case.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2769">Given this, the cases considered here have been chosen to meet several important, theory-driven selection criteria designed to produce the most challenging test possible from an inherently limited sample.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1161" href="#calibre_link-752" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2770">39</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2771"> First, they must enable direct observation of all independent and dependent variables; cases where the documentary record is insufficient or where participants are unavailable for interviewing are thus not suitable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2772">Second, they must collectively show variance on all three classes of explanatory variable&mdash;materiel, tribal culture, and internal politics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2773">Third, they should collectively explore as many distinct regions of the relevant theoretical space as possible (that is, they should approximate a stratified sample from that space). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2774">Fourth, they should present conditions for which the respective theories predict different outcomes, enabling the case to distinguish between them in their ability to explain the evidence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2775">Finally, they should provide maximum benefit of the doubt to the preexisting prototheories, and stack the deck against the new theory to </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-320" aria-label="17" title="17" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2776">the degree possible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2777">Small-</span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2778">n</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2779"> case testing cannot prove or disprove theories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2780">But if case testing shows the new theory outperforming its competition under conditions deliberately chosen to benefit the competition, this unusual result would merit a greater shift in confidence than would otherwise be warranted from such a small sample of cases.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2781">The cases examined here are Hezbollah in the 2006 Lebanon campaign; the Shiite Jaish al Mahdi (JAM) militia in Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2008; Mohammed Farah Aideed’s Habr Gedir militia in Somalia from 1992 to 1994; the Croatian nationalist ZNG and Croatian Serb SVK in the Croatian Wars of Independence of 1991&ndash;95; and the Vietcong in the American phase of the Second Indochina War from 1965 to 1968.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2782">Hezbollah in 2006 offers an opportunity for a controlled comparison with the Jaish al Mahdi in Iraq. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2783">Both were drawn from Shiite Arab communities that were much more tribal than those of their state opponents; both faced materially superior Westernized state militaries; and both had external support from the same Iranian patron. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2784">The 2006 campaign also approximates an Ecksteinian critical case for the hybrid materialist subschool: it is the single most prominent example of hybrid or fourth-generation warfare in the literature; for the theory to have much merit, it must account for Hezbollah in 2006. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2785">The two actors’ internal politics, by contrast, were very different: Hezbollah had a stable, elaborately developed formal institutional structure and saw its conflict with Israel as existential, whereas the JAM’s leadership was personalized and divided, with multiple factions turning increasingly to economic predation as the Iraq War continued. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2786">Orthodox materialist theories would thus predict similar, highly Fabian methods for both actors; tribal culture theories would do much the same, albeit with some expectation for more Napoleonic war fighting for the JAM (tribal norms were stronger in rural southern Lebanon than in urban Baghdad where the JAM was strongest). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2787">The new theory, by contrast, predicts substantially state-like midspectrum behavior for Hezbollah but more Fabian methods for the JAM&mdash;and this is in fact what the case evidence shows. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2788">The case also shows important variance between the details of Hezbollah’s methods and the particular expectations of hybrid materialists: whereas the latter see hybrid warfare as a combination of high-tech weapons and irregular tactics, Hezbollah’s tactics were no more irregular than those of most states.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2789">Mohammed Farah Aideed’s Somali National Alliance (SNA) militia approximates an Ecksteinian critical case for tribal culture theorists: if the theory is ever going to work anywhere, it should work here. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2790">Tribe and clan were the </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-383" aria-label="18" title="18" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2791">central organizing principles both for Somali society in general and for the competing warlord militias in the aftermath of the Siad Barre government’s fall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2792">And in fact the Somalia case plays a prominent role in the tribalist literature on nonstate warfare, which treats this as almost the defining case of tribally determined irregular war fighting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2793">The material imbalance here, by contrast, was more modest than in many cases of nonstate warfare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2794">For over a year and a half, the war pitted rival militias against one another, with no state military engaged; neither the SNA nor its enemies enjoyed a decisive material edge. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2795">Only when American forces arrived after December 1992 did the SNA face a material disadvantage, and even here the material balance was less favorable to the Western forces than in cases such as Iraq: the SNA had access to a substantial arsenal of sophisticated weapons inherited from the Siad Barre state military, and the SNA fielded an unusually large combatant force for the size of its operating area. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2796">Materialist theories would thus expect Aideed’s methods to change over time, with little need for the SNA to adopt highly Fabian irregular methods prior to 1993, but with increasingly Fabian “asymmetric” war fighting after that; neither period, however, should display a historical extremum of the kind that tribal culture arguments would expect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2797">The new theory, by contrast, predicts change in SNA behavior over time, but in the opposite direction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2798">The SNA’s political organization was personalized and highly informal throughout. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2799">Its stakes, however, changed dramatically by mid-1993. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2800">Before that, SNA war aims were limited and economic, but when American admiral Jonathan Howe declared in August 1993 that his goal would be Aideed’s capture and imprisonment and began targeting Aideed and his chief lieutenants, the war suddenly took on existential stakes for the SNA’s leadership. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2801">For the new theory, the SNA’s weak institutionalization would preclude highly complex midspectrum warfare throughout, but the radical change in stakes should motivate movement in that direction even for a nonstate militia&mdash;hence the new theory would predict </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2802">less</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2803"> Fabian war fighting after the American intervention, not more (as materialists would expect), and not stasis (as culturalists would predict). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2804">In fact the case shows change, and change in the direction of an increasing effort by the SNA to hold key territory after August 1993. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2805">At no point did this amount to truly state-like midspectrum warfare, but neither was it the extremum of irregular methods predicted by tribal culture arguments, and the direction of change was toward the Napoleonic end of the spectrum after the United States intervened and the material balance worsened for the SNA&mdash;not the opposite, as materialist logic would imply.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3369">The causal logic that interconnects these variables posits that material conditions create a militarily optimal behavioral choice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3370">But not all actors can implement it&mdash;internal politics create important constraints on military behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3371">Early in the 20th century, the materially optimal behavior for nonstate actors was highly Fabian and easy to implement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3372">Changing technology, however, has moved this optimum toward the middle of the Fabian-Napoleonic spectrum over time, creating increasingly difficult implementation requirements. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3373">Nonstate actors with permissive internal politics have been able to meet these requirements and have changed their behavior over time to reflect the changing material optimum. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3374">Nonstate actors without permissive politics, however, have been unable to implement complex midspectrum methods and so have retained simpler (but less powerful) highly Fabian methods even as the material military optimum changed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3375">The result has been increasing variance in nonstate behavior over time, as some have, but others have not, been able to respond to changing material military incentives.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3379">In particular, I argue in this chapter that at any given time, the materially optimal nonstate behavior is determined by the competing demands of the firepower needed to control territory and the cover needed to survive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3380">These virtues are inherently in tension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3381">The best resolution of this tension varies with an actor’s usable material superiority or inferiority relative to its enemy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3382">Actors with a usable material advantage can afford the exposure needed to project firepower and control territory; the greater the usable material advantage, then the more the optimal behavior choice favors exposure, firepower, and territorial control, and hence the more Napoleonic is the optimum. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3383">Actors inferior in usable materiel cannot survive as much exposure and must accept less ability to control territory as the price of the cover they need to survive; the greater the actor’s disadvantage in usable materiel, then the more the optimal behavior choice favors concealment and sacrifices territorial control, and hence the more Fabian is the optimum.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3384">Material advantages derive from both quantity (numbers) and quality (technology), but their relationship has changed over time&mdash;which has shifted over time the best resolution of the tension between firepower and cover, shifting in turn the militarily optimal behavioral choice for materially inferior nonstate actors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3385">As time has passed, technology has proliferated, and numerical preponderance has become less usable in battle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3386">These changes have reduced the usable material superiority of states over smaller, poorer, nonstate actors&mdash;and this in turn has shifted the material military optimum for such nonstate actors away from the Fabian extremum and toward midspectrum methods.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3387">This reduction in the usable military utility of numerical preponderance&mdash;and the associated shift in nonstate military material optima&mdash;derives from the growing lethality of increasingly proliferated modern weapons. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3388">Modern weapons are lethal enough that even a handful of surviving shooters can annihilate massed enemies in the open; because even a few survivors can accomplish this, it has become harder for technologically superior states to preempt nonstate enemies’ ability to punish massed exposure by state forces where nonstate actors deploy modern weapons and use them competently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3389">Instead, states facing such opposition have been forced to demass: to disperse their forces to enable them to find cover. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3390">Ever-greater requirements for dispersion, however, have progressively reduced the payoff to numerically large armies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3391">Increasingly, the real limiter on viable troop strength in a combat zone is the ability of the terrain to provide adequate cover to dispersed forces, not </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-640" aria-label="48" title="48" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3392">the number of troops theoretically available in a fully mobilized state population. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3393">And this has systematically reduced over time the value of one of the most important material advantages states enjoy over nonstate rivals: numerically superior forces. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3394">Of course it always helps to be numerically preponderant, and it always helps to be technologically superior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3395">But technological change has progressively tilted the playing field over time, constraining states’ ability to exploit their full material advantages, and progressively increasing the number of nonstate actors with the material wherewithal to compete with the forces that their state rivals can actually bring to bear.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3396">The net result has been a material military incentive for all actors to move toward the middle of the Fabian-Napoleonic spectrum. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3397">Numerically preponderant, once-Napoleonic states have an incentive to become more Fabian in the search for cover against increasingly lethal weapons; numerically inferior, once-Fabian nonstate actors have an incentive to become less Fabian as real territorial control becomes more realistically possible for them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3398">Of course, not all nonstate actors have the political prerequisites to respond to this incentive&mdash;a point I develop in detail in </span><a href="#calibre_link-71" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3399">chapter 4</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3400">.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3428">First, most states field larger combatant forces than most nonstate actors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3429">The median personnel strength for nonstate actors in these wars was a little over 12,000; the median strength for state combatants was 54,000, or more </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-424" aria-label="50" title="50" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3430">than four times the median nonstate actor’s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3431">In only 52 of the 160 wars studied were nonstate forces even half the size of their state rivals; in 32 cases the state army was more than 10 times larger than the nonstate actor’s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3432">This is not surprising. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3433">The Weberian state model is premised on contiguous territorial control and administrative capacity; though many states fall short of the full Weberian ideal, state status presumably conveys on average a greater population, tax base, and revenue potential than most actors who lack this status, and this should imply a greater ability to raise and field military forces on average. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3434">Indeed this central tendency underlies much of the orthodox literature on nonstate military actors, who are widely assumed to lack the material resources of states and to resort to “asymmetric” or “guerilla” methods as a result.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3435">Second, there is nevertheless a great deal of variance in the size of both state and nonstate armies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3436">The typical nonstate actor fields much smaller forces than the typical state army, but some nonstate forces are much larger than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3437">In fact, the largest nonstate military in the data set, Mao’s Chinese People’s Liberation Army in the Chinese civil war, fielded more than two million troops in 1945&mdash;making it larger than all but one of the 160 state militaries studied. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3438">In fact, almost 20 percent of the nonstate militaries were larger than the median state army; one-fourth of all nonstate armies were within 30 percent of the median state military’s size. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3439">Not all nonstate militaries are tiny forces dwarfed by much larger state rivals&mdash;some are; others are not.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3473">In fact, the heart of the distinction between the methods of pure Napoleonic and pure Fabian warfare lies in the tension between the demands of </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-368" aria-label="52" title="52" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3474">inflicting and surviving violence: the Napoleonic extremum radically privileges the former at the expense of the latter; the Fabian extremum does the opposite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3475">Yet both are important, and both must be combined to achieve the ultimate political purpose of warfare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3476">And it is this need to combine two conflicting virtues that gives rise to the interpenetrated nature of almost all real combat: armies that need to coerce or protect civilian populations cannot afford to choose either perfect survivability with zero lethality or perfect lethality with zero survivability and must instead reach some compromise between the two extremes.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3477">To understand the nature of that compromise and its relationship to materiel and politics, it is first necessary to explore the reasons for the tension in somewhat greater detail.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3478">Any military actor can reduce its vulnerability to enemy fire by changing its behavior&mdash;but this change normally reduces its ability to kill the enemy, other things being equal, at any given moment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3479">In conventional wars, for example, infantrymen can protect themselves from hostile fire by sheltering in foxholes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3480">But complete protection makes it impossible for them to fire their rifles; to fire they must expose their head and shoulders above the parapet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3481">Fire requires exposure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3482">Mortar crews can protect themselves by taking positions behind hills or buildings, exploiting their weapons’ high trajectory to reach over such obstacles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3483">But the act of firing risks giving their position away&mdash;the sound can be detected, and sophisticated enemies can sense the projectiles themselves with radars, computing the firing location from the shells’ path. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3484">Artillery and long-range missiles face similar dilemmas: their range enables a degree of security by standing back from the enemy, but firing creates detectable sound, flash, smoke, or moving projectiles, any of which can in principle be sensed and used to direct return fire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3485">And the very distance that helps protect the shooter also reduces the effectiveness of its fire: for a constant aiming error, increased range implies greater miss distance at the target. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3486">Even terminally guided weapons, whose accuracy is potentially independent of range, need information on the target’s location, and this need for a sensor that can detect the target creates a vulnerability in the form of a platform whose performance is itself proportional to its proximity to the target, and thus its exposure to fire from that target. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3487">The only way to ensure survival of the firing system as a whole is to remain silent in hidden locations without firing.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3872">Nonstate actors who can defend sympathetic civilians have an incentive to disentangle themselves from civilian populations by evacuating noncombatants from combat zones, shifting fighting positions to the outskirts of towns and away from clustered homes and schools, and adopting distinguishably military clothing and markings (both to enable noncombatants to be distinguished and to accentuate nonstate fighters’ status benefits as defenders of the people).</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3873">Nonstate actors who can destroy enemy forces have an incentive to rely more heavily on brute force and less heavily on coercion, enabling quicker results, greater control of the initiative, and less dependence on enemy choices and decisions for results.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3893">In particular, I argue that midspectrum war fighting demands much more extensive training than do simpler Napoleonic or Fabian methods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3894">Midspectrum war fighting is also uniquely dependent on complex interaction among mutually dependent specialists. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3895">All warfare creates collective action dilemmas for fighters, but these collective action problems are much more severe for midspectrum combatants than for those using simpler Napoleonic and Fabian approaches whose success is less dependent on cooperation among specialist subunits. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3896">To implement midspectrum military methods thus demands a much greater allocation of resources to expensive training, and much greater levels of interpersonal trust and cooperation across organizational subdivisions, than do more-Fabian or more-Napoleonic military methods.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3897">I then argue that nonstate actors’ internal politics shape their ability to overcome these implementation challenges and execute complex midspectrum methods effectively in the field. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3898">Actors facing existential stakes have strong incentives to divert resources from other purposes to mastering complex military skills; actors facing limited stakes often do not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3899">Actors with mature institutions find it easier to overcome collective action dilemmas and enable interunit cooperation; actors with immature institutions find this much harder to </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-686" aria-label="75" title="75" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3900">do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3901">Stakes and institutional maturity, however, vary widely across nonstate actors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3902">Some face existential stakes with mature institutions; others do not.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3909">To make this case, I first present a series of implementation challenges posed by midspectrum methods&mdash;and especially, a uniquely sharp collective action dilemma created by the military requirements of successful midspectrum war fighting&mdash;and I show how these challenges require both technical skill and interpersonal trust to resolve. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3910">Second, I discuss the role internal politics plays in enabling some actors, but not others, to overcome these dilemmas and respond to the incentives created by changing technology. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3911">I conclude by summarizing the resulting theory, and drawing from it a series of testable hypotheses to be assessed by the case studies in </span><a href="#calibre_link-3" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3912">chapters 6</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3913"> through </span><a href="#calibre_link-753" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3914">9</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3915">.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3932">This is because midspectrum methods require combatants to combine Napoleonic lethality and Fabian survivability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3933">Lethality and survivability are both virtues in war, but as noted above, they pose conflicting requirements. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3934">Extreme choices of purely Fabian or purely Napoleonic war fighting avoid the conflict and enable simple execution&mdash;but either extremum sacrifices something militarily critical in the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3935">To combine the two is much more powerful, but also much harder to do.</span></p>

<p class="tni"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4346">Mature institutions are necessary for complex midspectrum warfare, but they are not sufficient. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4347">Such methods also demand high levels of technical proficiency that can be obtained only via expensive training and preparation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4348">Even institutionally mature actors will not always be willing to spend the money and resources needed for such training: the United States, an institutionally very mature state actor, failed to do this before its entry into World War II and the Korean War and consequently fell well short of effective midspectrum war fighting early in both conflicts.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1340" href="#calibre_link-2156" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4349">44</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4350"> The difference between institutionally mature actors who make this expenditure and those who do not is often the stakes they perceive in expected warfare.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4351">Intuitively, a war’s stakes are the importance or gravity of its prospective outcomes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4352">Specifically, I define “stakes” as the absolute value of the perceived expected utility for the actor’s senior leadership group of the war’s potential outcomes.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1341" href="#calibre_link-2157" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4353">45</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4354">There are several meaningful elements to this definition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4355">First, it is the leadership’s </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4356">perception</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4357"> that matters, not the objective or observed outcome of the conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4358">These will often coincide, but where they do not it is the perception that motivates behavior, which is the dependent variable the theory seeks to explain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4359">Hence it is the perceived stakes that matter for the theory.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4360">Second, the actor whose perceptions matter is the combatant group’s </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4361">senior leadership</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4362">, defined as the members of the selectorate’s winning coalition.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1342" href="#calibre_link-2158" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4363">46</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4364"> The perceptions of the individual at the top of the group hierarchy are often a good proxy for those of the selectorate’s winning coalition&mdash;in a matter as important as war and peace, serious disagreements between the chief and the winning coalition would typically topple the chief&mdash;but the theory formally defines stakes in terms of the majority perception of the selectorate’s winning coalition.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4365">Third, it is </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4366">expected</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4367"> outcomes, not merely possible outcomes, that matter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4368">Hence the prospective result and its perceived probability are both important. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4369">Defeat is almost always possible for almost any actor given the uncertainty of war; it matters for the severity of the stakes whether this possibility is considered likely or remote.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4370">Fourth, the expected outcome that matters is the postwar </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4371">fate of the selectorate’s winning coalition</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4372">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4373">A war where defeat would likely kill or imprison the majority of the selectorate’s winning coalition is existential for that combatant actor even if the general public would likely prosper afterward, and vice versa. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4374">For most actors, to suffer conquest, annexation, or other forms of extinction </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-696" aria-label="100" title="100" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4375">as an independent political entity creates existential stakes for the leadership elite given their inability to ensure their own freedom or physical safety under such conditions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4376">Of course any war poses some risk of death for any individual participant; individuals among the elite may die even in a successful war effort, or even in a stalemated contest with little danger of conquest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4377">I thus frame stakes around the expected </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4378">group</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4379"> consequences for the critical elite group at the heart of decision making.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4380">Finally, it is the perceived </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4381">utility</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4382"> of that outcome that matters, not merely the outcome per se. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4383">Cognitive psychologists tell us that utility perceptions vary for prospective gains and prospective losses.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1343" href="#calibre_link-2159" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4384">47</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4385"> For most actors, fear of defeat weighs more heavily in perceived utility than hope of gain, hence aggressive wars in pursuit of gain with limited downside risk in the event of defeat will typically represent only low-to-moderate stakes for the theory even if the likely gains are large. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4386">By contrast, wars with a significant risk of defeat and ensuing death or imprisonment for the leadership will typically represent high stakes for the theory whether victory would yield gain or merely the status quo ante bellum.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4387">Expected utility can be difficult to observe; in practical terms, however, the key observable issue for stakes in the theory is whether the actor’s senior leadership believes the war poses a meaningful risk of their death or imprisonment if they fail militarily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4388">If so, the case presents an existential stake for that actor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4389">Conversely, wars in which the senior leadership believes defeat would forfeit potential gain but without their collective death or imprisonment would be coded as limited stakes, as would wars whose likely outcome is compromise partition of divisible financial or other aims, or stalemated conflicts where outright defeat is unlikely.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1344" href="#calibre_link-2160" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4390">48</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4391">War aims are related to, but distinct from, the war’s stakes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4392">Whereas </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4393">stakes</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4394"> involve the consequences of a war’s likely outcome for its combatants, </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4395">war aims</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4396"> are the outcome a combatant will accept as a condition for ending the war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4397">An enemy with modest war aims thus tends to reduce one’s own stakes: in a war between A and B, if A will accept a compromise peace offer from B with small concessions from B rather than holding out for B’s annihilation, then this reduces the disutility to B of the war’s plausible worst-case outcome, yielding modest stakes for B. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4398">By contrast, an enemy with ambitious war aims can increase one’s stakes: if A will accept only B’s annihilation and will reject all compromise offers short of this, then the disutility to B of the war’s plausible worst-case outcome could be very great (as long as A is strong enough for the threat of annihilation to be plausible). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4399">One’s own war aims can likewise </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-423" aria-label="101" title="101" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4400">influence the war’s stakes, but usually with smaller effects. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4401">A very ambitious war aim can increase the utility of the plausible best-case outcome to that actor (if the actor is strong enough for this aim to be plausibly achievable). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4402">But since the prospect of gain typically counts for less in utility perceptions than the fear of loss, ambitious aims of one’s own usually have smaller effects on stakes than ambitious aims by one’s enemy.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4403">Geographic or other physical variables can also shape the stakes in a conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4404">Indivisible territorial goals, for example (such as control of a holy city), tend to increase stakes by excluding compromise settlements that would moderate the difference between defeat and victory.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4518">First, it approximates what Harry Eckstein termed a </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4519">critical case</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4520"> for theories of military behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4521">Eckstein argued that cases with extreme values on the main independent variables can create conditions where theories should be at their strongest (or weakest), making it unusually illuminating if a theory fails to perform as expected. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4522">A most-likely case is one where extreme values put a theory on its strongest possible ground&mdash;if it is going to be right anywhere, it should be right here. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4523">For such cases, a valid theory should fail very rarely; if we nevertheless observe failure, this surprising result warrants a greater loss of confidence in the theory than would a single disconfirmatory observation under less ideal conditions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4524">Conversely, a least-likely case is one where extreme values make the theory unusually unlikely to succeed&mdash;even if the theory were generally valid, under such unfavorable conditions it might well fail anyway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4525">For such cases, we would expect weak theories to be overwhelmed by confounding effects; if we nevertheless observe successful prediction, this surprise would warrant a greater gain of confidence than would a single confirmation under less extreme conditions.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4526">Hezbollah in 2006 offers something approaching a most-likely critical case for tribal culture and materialist theories of military behavior, and a least-likely case for the new theory, making it an especially useful test. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4527">In particular, it provides a very close fit to the Arab tribal cultural model often cited as most conducive to low-exposure guerilla warfare, and to the asymmetric material disadvantage usually seen as mandating such methods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4528">If tribal culture or inferior material really are the most important determinants of tactics and strategy, their mutual reinforcement here ought to produce highly Fabian methods for Hezbollah. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4529">If orthodox theories fail to predict the outcome under conditions so strongly matched to those they describe as the paradigm of guerilla warfare, then the case poses an unusually strong challenge to their validity.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5552">Of course, this apparent shortfall is not attributable strictly to the JAM. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5553">The US military worldwide had important commitments to meet in Afghanistan and elsewhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5554">And Coalition forces in Iraq per se were fighting a combination of opponents including multiple Sunni insurgent factions; the bin Laden&ndash;affiliated Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI); and other Shiite militias, some of which, </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-569" aria-label="159" title="159" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5555">such as the ISCI (Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq) or Fadhila forces, were nominally integrated into the official Iraqi police. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5556">Some of these enemies fielded substantial forces: US intelligence reportedly estimated secular Sunni insurgent strength at perhaps 8,000 to 20,000 or more fighters in 2007, with AQI fielding another 5,000 in early 2008.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1553" href="#calibre_link-211" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5557">37</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5558"> Coalition efforts were thus spread over a wider range of enemies than just the JAM.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5559">The same could be said for the JAM itself, however: it was founded in the first place to defend Shiites from Sunni insurgents, and throughout 2007 in particular it fought a continuous battle against a variety of Sunni factions in the streets of Baghdad. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5560">Like the Coalition, the JAM faced multiple opponents. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5561">The Iraq War involved a complex web of fault lines; most combatants were forced to split their attention across multiple enemies.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5562">As with Hezbollah, the net result was thus a material balance that strongly favored the Coalition of state militaries over their nonstate Jaish al Mahdi opponent (or, for that matter, over all Iraqi nonstate actors collectively). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5563">Counting just the active-duty US, UK, and Iraqi government ground forces, the state militaries outnumbered the JAM by a factor of 31 to as much as 41 (depending on how one counts the ISF and assuming that the JAM numbered about 33,000). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5564">The Western members of the Coalition fielded weapons and equipment far superior to the JAM’s in all categories but perhaps one (the JAM’s EFPs had no Coalition equivalent but were certainly very effective); Iraqi forces were far less capable, but even so their materiel was generally no worse than the JAM’s.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5565">The magnitude of this material asymmetry, however, was probably not radically different from that facing Hezbollah against the Israeli state in 2006. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5566">Whereas the Hezbollah/IDF troop ratio was perhaps 15 to 65:1, the Coalition/JAM ratio was around 31 to 41:1. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5567">Neither Hezbollah nor the JAM could match the armor, aviation, or surveillance capabilities of their state opponents. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5568">For both Hezbollah and the JAM, their one area of meaningful technological competitiveness was in antiarmor capability: guided antitank missiles for Hezbollah, and EFPs for the JAM. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5569">And whereas Hezbollah’s Kornet and Metis-M missiles were nominally more sophisticated than the JAM’s EFPs, the urban battlefields on which the JAM fought made the theoretical range advantage conveyed by the Kornet and Metis-M irrelevant for the battles the JAM would have to fight.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5570">In practical terms, both Hezbollah and the JAM thus fought at major overall material disadvantages typical of most wars between state and nonstate combatants, albeit with an ability to compensate technologically in the crucial category of antiarmor weapons.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6017">I will argue, however, that the fit between SNA methods and tribal culture expectations is at best imperfect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6018">Certainly the SNA was not the Wehrmacht, and its behavior was far from the popular conception of conventional warfare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6019">But neither did it match the popular conception of irregular guerilla warfare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6020">Even in Somalia, warlords sought to take and hold ground. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6021">Their battles had clear front lines, and Aideed’s militia was willing to accept decisive engagement and conduct sustained close combat over a 15-hour battle against elite, heavily armed state soldiers who had adopted a positional defense in favorable urban terrain with extensive air cover. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6022">This was not a hit-and-run ambush by furtive guerilla raiders unwilling to close with a prepared enemy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6023">The net result </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-322" aria-label="183" title="183" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6024">was still much closer to the Fabian extreme than its Napoleonic alternative&mdash;in the new theory’s terms, SNA methods were much more Fabian than Hezbollah’s in 2006, for example. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6025">But the SNA demonstrates that even a radically tribal organization at a major material disadvantage will still display an interior choice of military methods that includes important elements of intuitively “conventional” war fighting.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6026">As with other cases, I develop this argument in five steps. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6027">First, I outline briefly the main events of the case. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6028">Second, I develop values for the main independent variables associated with the competing theories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6029">Third, I discuss the new theory’s dependent variable of observed SNA military behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6030">Fourth, I process-trace the fit between the theory’s causal logic and the proficiency of the SNA’s execution of its chosen methods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6031">Finally, I compare the SNA’s behavior to the respective theories’ predictions given these values, assess the relative fit between prediction and observation, and evaluate the case’s implications for the theories under study.</span></p>

<p class="tni"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6272">Until the deployment of TF Ranger in August 1993, the combatants in post-Barre Somalia were fighting mainly over the distribution of economic gain derived from international aid flows. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6273">While a few actors&mdash;notably Mohammed Farah Aideed&mdash;clearly harbored fond hopes of political power and had developed at least some rudimentary ideology to support that ambition, few of their followers shared this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6274">Whatever Aideed’s personal hopes, his organization waged war to affect the marginal distribution of economic spoils, as did its rival militias. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6275">When Admiral Howe decided that Aideed would have to </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-523" aria-label="196" title="196" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6276">be eliminated, however, and deployed TF Ranger to this end, the SNA’s stakes escalated to self-preservation, and the war politicized, with Aideed’s Habr Gidr clan unifying behind him and broad popular opposition to the UN presence mobilizing quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6277">When the United States then withdrew in 1994, this existential threat was removed and the SNA’s stakes returned to the profiteering of the pre-Ranger period.</span></p>

<p class="tni"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6714">As before, proficiency of execution offers an opportunity for process tracing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6715">The new theory’s causal logic implies that informally institutionalized, limited-stakes actors should display limitations of skill and military coordination that would render complex, midspectrum warfare impractical. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6716">In Somalia, the SNA displayed surprising proficiency in some key areas&mdash;especially in its tactics for attacking US helicopters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6717">For the SNA, however, real skill was limited chiefly to areas where small teams of experienced fighters could operate independently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6718">Tasks requiring the cooperation of teams larger than a half dozen or a dozen individuals were performed only in the simplest possible ways. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6719">And even some critical individual skills&mdash;especially small-arms marksmanship&mdash;were notably absent from the SNA rank and file.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6720">The SNA’s most impressive feat was its ability to shoot down multiple US helicopters without the use of any modern antiaircraft weapon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6721">Aideed’s forces owned at least one SA-7 Grail infrared-guided shoulder-fired antiaircraft missile, but there is no evidence of its employment against Western aircraft.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1733" href="#calibre_link-936" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6722">120</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6723"> Instead, the SNA modified the ubiquitous RPG-7 rocket-propelled antitank grenade to accommodate an airburst fuze that could detonate the warhead in the vicinity of an airborne target. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6724">They further understood that a helicopter’s tail rotor assembly was the most effective aim point: a fragile, complex </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-336" aria-label="218" title="218" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6725">subsystem, the tail rotor could be disabled with a single hit, and if it was disabled and unable to offset the rotational force created by the helicopter’s main rotor, the result would be an unrecoverable spin that would cause the aircraft to crash. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6726">Damage elsewhere on the fuselage could often be overcome, but a hit to the tail rotor was typically fatal, and SNA antiaircraft gunners knew this and aimed accordingly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6727">They also developed a novel firing posture in which pits were dug in dirt streets to enable a long weapon normally fired horizontally to be aimed upward by a prone shooter, accommodating the RPG’s considerable back-blast and allowing the shooter to conceal himself under camouflage as long as possible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6728">The SNA apparently did not devise these methods itself&mdash;it has been reported that Al Qaeda advisors who had fought Soviet helicopters in Afghanistan traveled to Somalia to train Aideed’s antiaircraft gunners and teach them how to modify the RPG for airburst detonation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6729">The militiamen they trained proved capable of absorbing the instruction and using it to good effect in Mogadishu.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1734" href="#calibre_link-937" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6730">121</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6731">Individual fighting positions selected by the SNA’s more capable gunmen were often well concealed, with little more than the shooter’s head and gun barrel visible over a windowsill or pile of rubble. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6732">Some appear to have understood the function of American infrared strobes, which were used to track US soldiers&mdash;downed pilot Michael Durant’s strobe was stripped from him after his capture and driven around Mogadishu in an apparent effort to confuse US searchers.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1735" href="#calibre_link-938" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6733">122</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6734"> American Delta Force soldier Paul Howe, not easily impressed, nevertheless offered grudging praise for some SNA fighters’ discipline and determination in a subsequent interview with journalist Mark Bowden.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1736" href="#calibre_link-939" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6735">123</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6736">Finally, the SNA was quite adept at massing large numbers of militiamen quickly against specific points whose locations they would not have been able to anticipate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6737">Aideed proved able to direct nearly overwhelming numbers of fighters against the TF Ranger positions around the downed helicopters in the Battle of Mogadishu, for example, and to do so within minutes to hours of the helicopters going down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6738">The SNA also quickly established roadblocks across the main routes that any UN reaction force would have to use to reach the TF Ranger perimeters.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1737" href="#calibre_link-940" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6739">124</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6740">The SNA also had many profound shortcomings, however. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6741">Among the most widely noted were systematically poor small-arms marksmanship, weak fire discipline, and substandard maintenance of weapons and equipment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6742">AK-47 fire in the Battle of Mogadishu was typically of the “spray and pray” variety, in which shooters emptied magazines on full automatic with no apparent attempt to aim shots at individual targets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6743">SNA ambushes were </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-455" aria-label="219" title="219" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6744">frequently launched with premature fire at the lead UN vehicle, alerting the rest of the column to the attack and enabling countermeasures before entering the kill zone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6745">Many of the SNA heavy weapons and armored vehicles the UN eventually collected in cantonment sites were inoperable or less than mission capable for mechanical reasons, and SNA weapons were frequently rusted or dirty.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1738" href="#calibre_link-941" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6746">125</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6747">Crew-served weapon positions were often exposed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6748">Attacks on TF Ranger positions were often simple mass frontal assaults in the open down exposed city streets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6749">Mortar and rocket fire was rarely adjusted (even though SNA observers could in principle have seen the fall of shot within UN base complexes) and typically inaccurate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6750">Mortars were not combined with direct fire, and crew-served weapons were rarely supported in any systematic way with small arms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6751">There was no apparent effort to combine movement with suppressive fire, to maneuver against flanks or other vulnerable points of UNOSOM positions, or to coordinate the movement of multiple formations.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1739" href="#calibre_link-942" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6752">126</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6753">This pattern of strengths and weaknesses is strongly suggestive of an organization that could field some small teams of competent individuals but which could not orchestrate complex activity over any formation larger than a handful of fighters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6754">The SNA fielded a mix of full-time, dedicated combatants and a much larger number of part-timers; some estimated a ratio of perhaps one full-time fighter for every four or five part-timers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6755">The full-time combatants were far from elite soldiers, but at least some had mastered basic individual skills and with proper instruction could be taught to employ novel methods such as RPG fire against moving helicopters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6756">What they could not do was to cooperate closely with other teams, especially over distances at which they could not see one another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6757">Where the SNA was able to direct action over distance these actions were simple and could be carried out with minimal direction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6758">Their system for alerting forces and concentrating them against the crash sites in the Battle of Mogadishu, for example, required only brief radio or courier messages instructing subordinate leaders to converge on the smoke columns created by burning tires or downed helicopters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6759">Barriers to block UN reaction forces could be placed in preplanned locations given the known positions of static UN bases and the available route structure into the Black Sea/Bakara Market neighborhood; here, too, simple execution orders could trigger local militia cells to carry out prearranged actions on cue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6760">And the subordinates could carry out such instructions with little reliance on others to provide supplies, intelligence, supporting or suppressive fires, flank protection, or route security. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6761">All they needed to do was move local debris into the road at the </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-329" aria-label="220" title="220" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6762">agreed locations and light the pile on fire, or to move toward the apparent scene of battle on order and execute individual-level or small-team techniques (such as RPG antiaircraft fire) when they got there.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6763">None of this is to suggest that Aideed was not a talented officer or that individual SNA militiamen could not be adaptive or resourceful. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6764">By observing TF Ranger and UNOSOM and analyzing their methods, Aideed and his lieutenants devised a simple but effective plan that inflicted considerable losses on a technically far superior force. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6765">But the SNA fell far short of the maximum lethality potentially available to them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6766">If their fighters had been able to hit targets consistently, combine suppressive fire with movement, maintain and employ heavy weapons, or integrate direct and indirect fire, to suggest just a few possibilities, it is entirely plausible that their numerical strength could have overwhelmed an isolated force of American light infantry and prevented its extraction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6767">The SNA in 1993 could not.</span></p>

<p class="tni"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6769">Given the codings above, what do the respective theories predict for the SNA’s military behavior? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6770">Tribal culture theories would predict behavior at or very near the Fabian extreme for the SNA. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6771">Somali society in 1993 was as deeply tribal as any in the modern world; if any military actor were to be constrained to Fabian methods by tribalism it should be the SNA.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6772">The material imbalance here, by contrast, was more modest than in many cases of nonstate warfare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6773">For over a year and a half, the war pitted rival militias against one another, with no state military engaged; neither the SNA nor its enemies enjoyed a decisive material edge. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6774">Only when American forces arrived after December 1992 did the SNA face a material disadvantage, and even here the material balance was less favorable to the Western forces than in cases such as Iraq: the SNA had access to a substantial arsenal of sophisticated weapons inherited from the Siad Barre state military, and the SNA fielded an unusually large combatant force for the size of its operating area. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6775">Materialist theories would thus expect Aideed’s methods to change over time, with little need for the SNA to adopt highly Fabian irregular methods prior to 1993, but with increasingly Fabian “asymmetric” war fighting after that; neither period, however, should display a historical extremum of the kind that tribalist arguments would expect.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6776">The new theory, by contrast, predicts change in SNA behavior over time, but in the opposite direction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6777">The SNA’s political organization was always </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-525" aria-label="221" title="221" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6778">personalized and highly informal; if the new theory is correct, this should constrain the SNA to significantly Fabian behavior throughout the period of study. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6779">The SNA’s stakes, however, changed dramatically by mid-1993. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6780">Before that, SNA stakes were limited and economic, but when American admiral Jonathan Howe declared in August 1993 that his goal would be Aideed’s capture and imprisonment and began targeting Aideed and his chief lieutenants, the war suddenly took on existential stakes for the SNA’s leadership. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6781">For the new theory, the SNA’s weak institutionalization would preclude highly complex midspectrum warfare even so, but the radical change in stakes should motivate movement in that direction even for a nonstate militia&mdash;hence the new theory would predict </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6782">less</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6783"> Fabian war fighting after the American intervention, not more (as materialists would expect), and not stasis (as tribal culture would predict).</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6784">How do these predictions compare with the SNA’s observed behavior? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6785">In fact the case shows change, and change in the direction of an increasing effort by the SNA to hold key territory after August 1993. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6786">At no point did this amount to truly state-like midspectrum warfare, but neither was it the extremum of irregular methods predicted by tribal culture, and the direction of change was toward the Napoleonic end of the spectrum after the United States intervened and the material balance worsened for the SNA&mdash;not the opposite, as materialist logic would imply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6787">More specifically, the combat behavior described above yields a computed index value of 1.2 for SNA methods prior to August 1993, and 2.5 after this, which would be described as mostly, and slightly, Fabian, respectively, by the framework in </span><a href="#calibre_link-71" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6788">chapter 4</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6789">.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1740" href="#calibre_link-943" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6790">127</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6791">This creates significant tensions with tribal culture explanations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6792">While the SNA was hardly a state-like, midspectrum military organization, neither was it a classically irregular Fabian extremum. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6793">In fact, the SNA’s duration of engagements, typical engagement ranges, troop concentration, and reliance on counterattack were all roughly as “conventional” as Hezbollah’s&mdash;SNA engagement ranges were typically shorter, in fact; its force-to-space ratio was much higher; and the SNA’s entire concept for defense of its Black Sea/Bakara Market stronghold was heavily dependent on counterattack to expel intruders from a territorial sanctuary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6794">These are not the hallmarks of a tribalist pure Fabian irregular archetype&mdash;the SNA’s actual behavior shares too many features of archetypically “conventional” war fighting.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6795">Materialist theory also has trouble with the SNA. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6796">Materialist approaches, for example, would predict an increasingly Fabian fighting style for Aideed’s militia as its material military balance decayed with the American reinforcements </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-359" aria-label="222" title="222" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6797">after August 1993; in fact, the SNA’s behavior did change, but in precisely the opposite direction: the SNA became </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6798">less</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6799"> Fabian, not more, after August.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6800">The hybrid materialist subschool also faces important challenges in explaining the SNA. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6801">Aideed’s militia had significant access to the modern, precision weapons that hybrid materialists see as the central driver behind Hezbollah-like midspectrum warfare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6802">The key technology underlying the hybrid thesis is precision-guided antitank weaponry (ATGW). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6803">The SNA was not as well equipped as Hezbollah, but they did inherit a meaningful arsenal of heavy weapons from the Barre regime, and among these were at least 86 US-made TOW missiles.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1741" href="#calibre_link-944" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6804">128</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6805"> The BGM-71 TOW (tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided) is a terminally guided large-caliber antitank weapon able to penetrate over 760 millimeters of armor at ranges in excess of three kilometers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6806">In 1993 it was the primary first-line Western ATGW and was in wide use among NATO state armies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6807">In physical size, logistical requirements, technical sophistication, and potential lethality it was in the same general family as Hezbollah’s Russian-made Kornets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6808">Of course the Kornet in 2006 was a more modern weapon than the SNA’s TOWs, but it is far from clear that the difference was militarily meaningful in the 1993 context: in skilled hands either weapon could be expected to achieve hit probabilities as high as 0.9 against armored targets at extended ranges, and to penetrate any armored target they were likely to encounter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6809">In principle the SNA’s TOW holdings were more than sufficient to have wiped out the entire armored column that eventually relieved TF Ranger on October 3&ndash;4, and to have held off any UNOSOM reinforcements sent from elsewhere in the theater.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1742" href="#calibre_link-353" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6810">129</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6811"> The SNA, however, made no recorded use of these missiles, which were found by UNOSOM among the heavy weapons Aideed voluntarily cached at secured weapon cantonment sites in Mogadishu.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1743" href="#calibre_link-354" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6812">130</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6813"> But the difference between Hezbollah’s antiarmor performance in 2006 and the SNA’s in 1993 was not due to any lack of weaponry on the SNA’s part&mdash;if Aideed had chosen to use his missiles rather than storing them, then his fielded technology and Hezbollah’s would not have been radically different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6814">Of course, Aideed’s ability to </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6815">employ</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6816"> those missiles would probably have been very different (his willingness to store the missiles under UNOSOM surveillance probably reflected doubt that his gunners could operate them effectively, combined with the SNA’s limited stakes in the conflict prior to Howe’s escalation). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6817">But this is not attributable to the materiel itself; as a materialist theory predicting nonstate military behavior from actors’ technology, the hybrid warfare thesis would thus predict comparable behavior for actors with comparable technology and would thus imply similar methods for Hezbollah and the SNA.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-397" aria-label="223" title="223" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6818">The new theory, by contrast, correctly anticipates the SNA’s failure to reach the purely Fabian extremum, which the new theory sees as vanishingly rare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6819">The SNA’s mostly-to-slightly Fabian behavior is consistent with its informal institutional structure, as the new theory expects. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6820">And the new theory, unlike materialist approaches, can accommodate the SNA’s shift away from the Fabian extremum after August 1993, when its altered stakes altered its incentive structure for defending ground. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6821">This behavior is a stronger fit to the new theory’s expectations than to those of its orthodox competitors.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6822">This is not to claim a perfect fit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6823">As with the JAM, the SNA’s observed behavior is more Napoleonic than the functional form in the </span><a href="#calibre_link-73" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6824">appendix</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6825"> anticipates: for the conditions here, the functional form predicts a very Fabian behavioral score of just 0.1 before August 1993, and 1.1 afterward.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1744" href="#calibre_link-945" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6826">131</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6827"> The direction of change is indeed as predicted, but both predictions are significantly more Fabian than the SNA’s actual choices. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6828">As with the JAM, however, there may be reasons to think that the SNA would have been better served with more-Fabian behavior than they actually displayed in 1993. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6829">The SNA took very heavy casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu; although estimates vary, some put the figure as high as 2,000 and even the SNA’s own leadership placed its militia losses at 312 fighters killed and 814 wounded (or at least 17 times UNOSOM’s losses), many of whom were surely disabled before firing a shot given their often-exposed postures (whereas TF Ranger began the battle with strict restrictions on collateral damage, the desperation of the unfolding battle led to less and less reticence on firing into crowds of noncombatants, hence the SNA’s reliance on intermingling alone for cover probably afforded them little advantage by the end of the engagement).</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1745" href="#calibre_link-946" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6830">132</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6831"> A stealthier posture with fewer frontal assaults and more use of building interiors for cover, for example, might have inflicted similar losses on TF Ranger with fewer SNA casualties while remaining well within the capacity of an informally institutionalized actor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6832">But the scale of divergence between prediction and observation for the new theory, while nonzero, is nevertheless smaller than for its competing explanations&mdash;and for a case where culturalist theory, in particular, should be on its strongest possible ground.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6843">I will argue that the case contradicts materialist expectations for military behavior while supporting those of the new theory&mdash;and that MPRI’s role illustrates how military privatization can interact with internal politics to reshape military behavior and capability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6844">In particular, I will show that by hiring outsiders with no local constituency or power base, divided Croatian elites could improve capability against an external enemy (the SVK) without undermining the internal balance of political power among themselves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6845">This in turn </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-408" aria-label="225" title="225" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6846">allowed an imperfectly institutionalized emergent Croatian state to overcome the effects of internal division and circumvent the constraints that factionalized internal politics normally impose on complex military methods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6847">The result was a Croatian military that effectively annihilated its SVK opposition in a four-day blitzkrieg in 1995. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6848">The Croatian case shows that internal politics are indeed a critical determinant of military behavior and capability&mdash;and that among the most important functions of nonstate private military firms can be their potential to end-run otherwise restrictive politics within and among the actors that hire them.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6849">As before, I develop this argument in five steps. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6850">First, I outline briefly the main events of the case. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6851">Second, I develop values for the main independent variables associated with the competing theories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6852">Third, I code the dependent variable of military behavior for the respective actors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6853">Fourth, I trace the causal processes in the case by assessing the actors’ proficiency in executing their chosen methods and how this does or does not conform to the new theory’s logic of explanation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6854">Finally, I compare the ZNG/HV’s and SVK’s observed behavior to the respective theories’ predictions given these values, assessing the relative fit between prediction and observation and discussing the case’s net implications for the theories under study.</span></p>

<h2 class="h"><span class="kobospan1" id="calibre_link-6855">Overview of Events</span></h2>
<p class="tni"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6856">With the death of longtime Jugoslav strongman Josef Brozip Tito in 1980, the Federation of Jugoslavia began a long side toward dissolution in a series of ethnic civil wars. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6857">By early 1990, separatist political parties had been established in the Jugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia, and in spring 1990 the Croatian nationalist HDZ (Hrvatska demokratska zajednica, or Croatian Democratic Union) won the republic’s first multiparty elections. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6858">The Serb-dominated federal government in Belgrade, fearing possible secession, then ordered the Jugoslav National Army (JNA) to disarm the Croatian Territorial Defense force (TO), a home guard of trained reservists whose mission had been to defend Croatian territory from foreign invasion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6859">Croatia responded by expanding its Ministry of Interior police force (MUP), triggering debate in Belgrade over continued suppression.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1747" href="#calibre_link-1013" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6860">2</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6861">In the midst of this uncertainty, the Serbian minority within Croatia took matters into its own hands. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6862">Threatened by the prospect of minority status within a new state dominated by ethnic Croats, Croatian Serbs thus declared the Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina (SAOK) on February 28, 1991, and </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-479" aria-label="226" title="226" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6863">announced their intention to secede from Croatia if Croatia itself separated from Jugoslavia. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6864">This led to sporadic violence between the MUP and Croatian Serbs as the latter sought to consolidate control over Serb-populated localities within Croatia, and especially along the Serbian border and the Krajina region along the Bosnian border. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6865">In May the HDZ created a new National Guard Corps, the ZNG, from paramilitary elements of the MUP and the remnants of the disarmed TO. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6866">Caught in the middle, the JNA was ordered by Belgrade to act as a buffer to separate armed Croatian Serbs from Croatian police and the new ZNG National Guards, but in fact the Serb-heavy JNA tended to side with their ethnic brethren at the expense of the Croatian nationalists.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6867">As low-level violence continued through the spring, neighboring Slovenia declared its own independence from the Jugoslav Federation on June 25, 1991. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6868">The JNA launched an immediate offensive against the Slovenians but was defeated in a brief, 10-day campaign as a combination of defections by ethnic Slovene troops, political divisions in Belgrade over appropriate responses, and morale problems in the JNA’s ranks hamstrung efforts to suppress secessionist forces.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6869">The Slovenian declaration forced the HDZ’s hand, and Croatia quickly issued its own formal declaration of independence, also on June 25. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6870">Yet there was no immediate JNA offensive in Croatia. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6871">The JNA maintained substantial garrisons in the republic, and its troops had been conducting operations to suppress internal violence for months. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6872">But the JNA was initially preoccupied with the campaign in Slovenia, and the federal government in Belgrade was divided over its policy toward secession. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6873">In particular, the JNA command and some hardline politicians wanted aggressive action to crush secessionists and preserve the unified Jugoslav state. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6874">But Jugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic was more concerned with advancing the secular interests of his own, Serbian ethnic group than in reconstructing a multiethnic federal union. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6875">Milosevic and his allies were thus willing to let non-Serb territories go as long as areas with mixed populations including Serb minorities were cleansed of non-Serbs and united in a greater Serbia centered on Belgrade and the rump of the old Jugoslav state. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6876">As this debate unfolded in Belgrade, the JNA carried on in Croatia but did not move to destroy the new Croatian National Guard, to unseat the HDZ, or to seal Croatia’s borders.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6877">Instead, the Croatian nationalists moved first. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6878">On September 14, 1991, the ZNG attacked JNA garrisons across Croatia, initiating large-scale hostilities. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6879">In the process they seized valuable arms and ammunition and overran enough of the JNA’s base structure to establish a tenuous but contiguous zone of control across central Croatia.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-409" aria-label="227" title="227" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6880">The JNA responded with a large-scale counterattack, in combination with Croatian Serb militias backed by the SAOK. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6881">This Jugoslav government offensive gradually drove the Croatian ZNG from the Krajina, consolidating Serbian/JNA control of central Croatia, eastern Slavonia, and northern Dalmatia.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6882">As the JNA advanced, however, ZNG resistance stiffened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6883">Croatian nationalist counterattacks regained control of most of western Slavonia, and eventually the front stabilized with perhaps 70 percent of the republic’s territory under nationalist control and the remainder in the hands of the Croatian Serb SAOK and its JNA allies.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6884">A cease-fire brokered by UN special envoy Cyrus Vance was then signed on January 2, 1992, ending the initial phase of the war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6885">The Vance plan brought UN peacekeepers under the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), and the establishment of UN-protected areas in Croatia and neighboring Bosnia, where a civil war of its own had broken out in April 1992.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6886">In the meantime, the European Community had requested formal applications from Jugoslav republics seeking recognition as independent states, and Germany formally recognized the new Croatian government on December 24, 1991. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6887">The EC followed in January; the United States in April; and by May the UN followed suit, establishing an unambiguously independent Croatian state. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6888">With independence, the new Croat state formed the HV, or Croatian national army, to replace the nonstate ZNG. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6889">The Serbian Croat SAOK, by contrast, united with the neighboring Croatian Serb enclaves of Western Slavonia and Eastern Slavonia-Baranja-Western Srem to form the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), which then petitioned the EC and the UN for recognition as an independent state on December 23, 1991, but was denied; in fact no state or major international organization ever recognized the SAOK or RSK as independent.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1748" href="#calibre_link-1014" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6890">3</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6891">The Vance cease-fire was imperfect, with occasional outbreaks of fighting and a major violation in January 1993 in which the HV sought to clear lines of communication between southern Dalmatia and central Croatia. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6892">The HV was also deeply involved with efforts by the Croatian minority in neighboring Bosnia to cleanse rivals and gain territory at the expense of ethnic Serbs and Bosnian Muslims there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6893">But within the boundaries of the old Jugoslav Croatian republic the war was largely in remission between 1992 and 1995.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6894">During this time, the Croatian government sought to build its new state institutions while developing its military capabilities. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6895">To this end it hired an American private firm, Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI) to assist in developing and improving the HV.</span></p>

<p class="tni"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6908">Culture, in the sense of ethnic self-identity, was a major theme in all the Balkan Wars of the 1990s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6909">Croatian nationalists promoted a conception of Croatian cultural distinctiveness based on its Catholic religion, its history, and its Western-leaning values by contrast with the Orthodox and Eastern-oriented Serbs or the Muslim Bosnians. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6910">Tension between these ethnocultural groups became the rallying point for a decade of warfare in the region. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6911">This does not mean that ethnic tension caused the wars: “ancient hatreds” between Balkan ethnic groups had rarely yielded war in centuries of mostly peaceful coexistence prior to the 1990s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6912">Without Milosevic and others’ deliberate promotion of ethnic rivalry there would probably have been no warfare in the 1990s, either, and the salience of ethnicity among competing sources of identity was a social construction of relatively recent provenance.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1749" href="#calibre_link-1015" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6913">4</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6914"> Yet there was nevertheless a cultural distinction that was widely perceived in the region and that played a role&mdash;whether as cause or effect&mdash;in the region’s warfare.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6915">Croatian as opposed to Serbian national culture is not, however, the distinction that matters for the nonstate military behavior debate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6916">Familist tribalism is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6917">It is the unique features of tribal social organization based on family relationships that this literature sees as conducive to guerilla warfare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6918">And in these terms, neither Croatian nor Serbian society was notably tribal in the 1990s.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1750" href="#calibre_link-516" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6919">5</span></a></sup></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6926">This system began to break down, however, with industrialization and urbanization after the 1860s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6927">Zadruga tribal organization was anchored in a quasi-feudal peasant agricultural economy in which land ownership and tenure shaped social standing and community life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6928">As opportunities grew for nonfarm employment away from ancestral lands, the strength of the old ties weakened, and the influence of zadruga familial structure atrophied. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6929">When changes to the legal system abolished the vestiges of feudalism, this process accelerated: in 1870, a law was passed in Croatia allowing formerly integral zadruga land to be divided among individual owners; the result was a rush to break up the old holdings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6930">By the early 20th century, little of the old economic foundation of Balkan familial tribalism was left, and what did remain was stronger in eastern Slavic lands&mdash;Croatia in the west was among the first to transform.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1752" href="#calibre_link-1017" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6931">7</span></a></sup></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6939">By contrast with this decline in zadruga familism, the rise of ethnic self-awareness in the late 20th century played an increasing role in Balkan politics </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-480" aria-label="231" title="231" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6940">and public life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6941">But this ethnic identification spanned populations of far greater size than traditional tribes or clans. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6942">Self-described ethnic Croatians in 1990 numbered some 4.5 million individuals; Jugoslav Serbs accounted for a population of more than 8.5 million.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1755" href="#calibre_link-1020" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6943">10</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6944"> Collectives of this size constituted economically&mdash;and militarily&mdash;viable states. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6945">And whereas classical tribal systems are subject to fluid in-group/out-group definition (“me against my brother, my brother and I against my cousin, and all of us against the stranger”), Balkan ethnic groups, once mobilized, constituted much more fixed communities with stable membership. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6946">Of course Balkan ethnic parties could shift interethnic alliances for strategic purposes (Bosnian Croats, for example, alternately fought Bosnian Muslims then supported them against a common Serb enemy), but so do states in the international system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6947">And Balkan ethnic parties could certainly divide into factional disputes over policy, strategy, or the division of spoils (much more on this below), as do many state governments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6948">Classical tribal systems, however, recognize multiple identity subgroups with no fixed loyalty claims; alignment is transient and ephemeral, and real trust thus inheres in very localized small-scale kinship groups. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6949">Balkan nationalist politics could be as factionalized or strategic as that of any state, but its </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6950">identity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6951"> component spanned much larger groups with much less fluid membership than in traditional tribal systems.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7459">Orthodox materialism expects outnumbered, outgunned nonstate actors to adopt irregular methods; each of Croatia’s nonstate actors faced forbidding material imbalances. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7460">The nationalist ZNG fought the JNA-Serb alliance in mid-1991 at a numerical disadvantage of perhaps 4:1 and a disadvantage in gross firepower that may have been even greater. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7461">The Serbian SVK was well equipped, but outnumbered by the then-state Croatian HV by around the same 4:1 margin the ZNG had faced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7462">Orthodox materialists would thus expect both the ZNG and the SVK to adopt high-concealment classically Fabian war fighting.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7463">Hybrid warfare materialists expect nonstate actors with access to modern weapons to wage proficient midspectrum warfare along the lines of Hezbollah in 2006. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7464">The Serbian SVK was lavishly equipped with such weaponry by their allies in Belgrade. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7465">But even the ZNG had substantial access to advanced weapons once the Battle of the Barracks provided them with captured JNA stocks, which included AT-3 Sagger wire-guided precision antitank weapons, T-55 tanks, M-80 infantry fighting vehicles, and hundreds of tubes of modern artillery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7466">In fact, the ZNG had access to more firepower than Hezbollah did; hybrid warfare theory would thus expect both the ZNG and the SVK to adopt Hezbollah-like proficient midspectrum methods.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7526">This role for private military actors also helped overcome some of the remaining internal political constraints that could otherwise have hamstrung HV performance in 1995. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7527">Tudjman had bought stability in the Croatian security sector by personalizing the senior leadership functions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7528">While some of these loyalist appointees proved quite able, others were not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7529">To dismiss political allies in favor of military technocrats would have risked the balance among elites that Tudjman depended on for order in a still maturing government. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7530">What MPRI offered in this setting was a source of technocratic expertise, extending to the most senior levels, that did not require Tudjman to upset the elite balance of power by reshuffling security sector leadership appointments or empowering some at the expense of others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7531">MPRI’s American contractors had no Croatian constituency and presented no meaningful threat to the political position of any of Tudjman’s senior appointees. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7532">In a fragile or informal political order, even nominally disinterested military contractors&mdash;whether in the form of trainers or actual forces&mdash;would still be dangerous: how could a potentially threatened member of the elite be sure that this new power would not be captured by one of their rivals and used against them? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7533">In a basic or mature natural order, however, the greater role of formal offices and the </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-711" aria-label="262" title="262" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7534">established norms of interaction among elite officeholders offer a degree of protection against the more egregious forms of internal aggression&mdash;and this enables such regimes to take advantage of outside skills (or even forces, in the right setting) because these will not constitute clear and imminent threats to the established order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7535">The result in Croatia was a significant improvement in a new military’s proficiency in the very demanding skills of theater-level midspectrum military cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7536">On balance, then, the case is more consistent with the new theory&mdash;and especially the new theory’s causal logic&mdash;than its competitors are. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7537">And while the new theory does not fit the case perfectly&mdash;it implies that the SVK should have adopted simpler, more Fabian methods than those it actually employed&mdash;it is wrong for the right reasons.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1855" href="#calibre_link-1120" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7538">110</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7539"> That is, it explains the SVK’s inability to execute the methods it chose given its internal politics, and in the process sheds light on the incentive structures faced by all nonstate actors: while most will choose more astutely than the Croatian Serbs, the new theory explains what will happen to those who do not.</span></p>

<p class="co"><small class="calibre7"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7543">IN THIS CHAPTER</span></small><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7544"> I present the book’s final case method test: the Vietcong (VC) in the Second Indochina War, from the introduction of American combat troops in 1965 through the virtual destruction of the VC as a major combatant in the Tet Offensive of 1968. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7545">The Vietcong are perhaps the paradigmatic nonstate irregular force in the eyes of most Americans, and their methods had a profound influence on subsequent policy and scholarship; any theory of nonstate warfare must account for the Vietcong. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7546">The case also offers a theoretically important opportunity to observe nonstate warfare prior to the advent of precision firepower&mdash;in fact, the 1965&ndash;68 era in Vietnam offers one of the last examples of warfare before the dawn of modern precision weaponry, which was introduced in the war’s latter campaigns. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7547">As such, the case offers an important opportunity to assess the importance of technological change by exploring a region of the theoretical space unobserved in the other four cases above.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7548">The chief finding from the case is to corroborate the new theory’s account of technology’s role in nonstate war fighting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7549">The Vietcong faced existential stakes and had remarkably formal, mature institutions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7550">There is good reason to believe they could have mastered the complexity of modern midspectrum warfare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7551">Yet they chose mostly Fabian methods instead&mdash;and suffered gravely when they departed from this pattern as in Tet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7552">I argue that their inability to succeed militarily with less Fabian methods is attributable to their low-lethality weapon technology, which combined with the difficult jungle terrain of their primary operating areas to leave them unable to control territory on the necessary scale even though they deployed a large combatant force. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7553">With only light, low-firepower weapons at their disposal, the VC could not prevent their </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-380" aria-label="264" title="264" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7554">American, and to some extent South Vietnamese, state opponents from massing overwhelming combat power at chosen points. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7555">The problem here was not numerical imbalance per se, or even technological asymmetry&mdash;Hezbollah and the Croatian ZNG both proved able to control ground with midspectrum methods under comparable numerical and technical inferiority. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7556">But whereas Hezbollah and the ZNG had modern weapons lethal enough to force better-equipped state enemies to disperse, yielding manageable local imbalances at the critical points, the VC did not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7557">The Vietcong’s 1960s-era light weapons and small arms could cause gradual attrition over time, but they could not stop a massed state offensive from crushing their defenses at any given point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7558">Nor could the Vietcong take ground against state armies’ positional defenses with such arms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7559">Their only option was thus to resort to the high-concealment methods of Fabian irregular warfare, notwithstanding their existential motivation and mature institutions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7560">Later nonstate actors with more advanced weapons were able to make different choices even when faced with materially superior state opponents.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7561">As before, I develop this argument in five steps. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7562">First, I outline briefly the main events of the case. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7563">Second, I develop values for the key independent variables associated with the competing theories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7564">Third, I code the dependent variable of VC military behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7565">Fourth, I process-trace the relationship between the theory’s causal logic and the events of the case through a discussion of the VC’s proficiency of execution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7566">I conclude by assessing the relative fit between prediction and observation in light of this, and the case’s net implications for the theories under study.</span></p>

<p class="tni"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7615">Vietnamese society in the 1960s was relatively homogeneous, with a population that mostly shared a common language and ethnic background. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7616">In this shared culture, family played an important role and served as the most important single social unit&mdash;yet the cultural role of descent was on balance less pervasive and influential than in 1990s Somalia or southern Lebanon in 2006.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8050">Is this relative Fabianism attributable to the dyadic imbalance of firepower in Vietnam, as orthodox materialism would suggest, or to the VC’s monadic lack of modern weaponry, as the new theory claims? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8051">Both are relevant, but the analysis above highlights the problem of inadequate midcentury weapon technology in particular. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8052">Other, more recent nonstate armies have faced dyadic imbalances as great or greater than that in Vietnam yet have employed far less Fabian methods without suffering annihilation: Hezbollah in 2006 and the Croatian ZNG in 1991 both faced state enemies whose dyadic material superiority was at least comparable to that enjoyed by US forces in Vietnam. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8053">Yet Hezbollah and the ZNG adopted midspectrum methods without suffering the fate of Vietcong attackers in the Tet Offensive, and with much greater stopping power than Vietcong defenders could muster against Operations Attleboro, Cedar Falls, and Junction City. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8054">With modern high-firepower weapons at their disposal, Hezbollah and the ZNG could make massed state offensives </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-662" aria-label="291" title="291" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8055">prohibitively costly to their state foes; when the latter spread out in response, nonstate armies with smaller forces in the theater as a whole found they could deploy forces at the front large enough to compete with state armies for the control of ground. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8056">The Vietcong had the skills to do so, too. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8057">What they lacked was the technology, as the new theory claims.</span></p>

<p class="co"><small class="calibre7"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8061">FOR GENERATIONS,</span></small><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8062"> most analysts have expected state and nonstate actors to fight very differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8063">States fighting other states have been expected to wage high-intensity “conventional” warfare wherein large, uniformed, heavily armed formations would maneuver in the open on mostly rural battlefields away from large civilian populations, using massed firepower to destroy one another as a means to take and hold ground. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8064">Nonstate actors have been expected to intermingle indistinguishably with civilians, using roadside bombs, snipers, ambushes, assassinations, and suicide vests to coerce state rivals rather than taking and holding ground or seeking decisive battle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8065">More recently, some analysts have posited a new “hybrid warfare” model, wherein nonstate actors add precision weapons and information warfare to irregular battlefield tactics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8066">These expectations have usually derived from assumptions about nonstate material inferiority or tribal culture; some now see new technology as the underpinning of nonstate hybrid war fighting.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8067">I have argued, however, that there are no conceptually important military distinctions of kind between state and nonstate actors as combatants, or between conventional, hybrid, and irregular war fighting as methods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8068">All combatants must respond to a common set of incentives created ultimately by the nature of weapon technology. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8069">And since at least 1900, all sound war-fighting systems, whoever adopts them, have had to blend features commonly associated with both “conventional” </span><i class="calibre5"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8070">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8071"> “irregular” warfare&mdash;the very categories themselves are artificial heuristics that appear in their pure form only as rare extrema on a continuous spectrum in which almost all real actors occupy points somewhere in the middle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8072">This does not mean the resulting differences of degree are unimportant&mdash;in fact they have major policy implications, to which I return below. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8073">But the range of typical variance is narrower, the differences that matter are subtler, and the underlying similarities are more </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-594" aria-label="293" title="293" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8074">important than commonly supposed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8075">To treat state and nonstate actors&mdash;or conventional, irregular, and hybrid methods&mdash;as categorical distinctions of kind is an oversimplification with potentially serious consequences for policy and scholarship.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8076">The causes of this subtler variance are also different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8077">Although materiel, in particular, does matter, I have argued that nonstate actors’ internal politics play a far more important role than typically recognized, and that nonstate war fighting cannot be properly understood without a systematic treatment of how materiel (and especially technology) interacts with institutions and stakes.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8078">The importance of institutions and stakes in this political theory of nonstate war fighting arises from the military demands of surviving modern firepower. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8079">All warfare poses a trade-off between lethality and concealment; the most effective resolution of this tension requires militaries to role specialize internally and rely on complex cooperation among the resulting interdependent specialists. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8080">Yet this specialization heightens collective action challenges that are inherent in all warfare: how does one fighter know that others on whom he or she depends will risk their lives on his or her behalf rather than fleeing instead? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8081">The greater a military’s reliance on interdependent specialists, the greater the risk if collective action fails. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8082">The result is a central role for the traits that shape cooperation in the presence of collective action dilemmas&mdash;and, especially, an actor’s institutional structure and stakes.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8083">In particular, nonstate actors with mature institutions and existential stakes can master the complexity of interdependent midspectrum warfare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8084">If their weapon technology can compel numerically preponderant enemies to disperse, then nonstate actors with mature institutions and existential stakes can exploit midspectrum war fighting and have strong incentives to do so. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8085">By contrast, nonstate actors with weak institutions and limited stakes face major barriers to internal cooperation that often prevent them from mastering interdependent military complexity regardless of their equipment; their best choices given the political constraints they face resemble the more Fabian “irregular” warfare often associated with guerillas.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1939" href="#calibre_link-2078" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8086">1</span></a></sup></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8087">Nonstate actors vary widely along these dimensions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8088">Some, such as Hezbollah, the Croatian ZNG, or the Sri Lankan LTTE, have had elaborate, mature institutions that rival those of many states. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8089">Others, such as Mohammed Farah Aideed’s SNA in Somalia, the Jaish al Mahdi in Iraq, or the RUF in Sierra Leone, have been ruled by loose coalitions of armed elites whose wary personal interactions shape decisions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8090">Stakes are similarly variable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8091">In 2006, Hezbollah’s existence turned on its narrative of existential zero-sum conflict with </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="calibre_link-654" aria-label="294" title="294" type="pagebreak"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8092">Israel; in 1991 the Croatian separatist leadership faced death or imprisonment if their military failed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8093">UNITA in the Angolan civil war, by contrast, fought for years over limited economic stakes with little fear of government conquest; prior to US intervention, Aideed’s SNA was similarly waging a limited war for limited economic aims.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8094">This variance in internal politics implies important variance in nonstate actors’ likely ability to use modern weapons to their full potential. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8095">As technology proliferates, some will be able to exploit new weapons to wage state-like midspectrum warfare&mdash;but others, faced with the same technological opportunities, will not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8096">And for any given actor, this means that the best way to anticipate their methods is not to focus on their technology alone; this does matter, but only in interaction with their internal politics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8097">Without a sound analysis of their institutional structure and stakes, intelligence reporting on their technology alone is a very poor predictor of actors’ military behavior.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8098">I assess this theory in a series of case studies of nonstate warfare conducted under conditions of special importance for the theory’s validity: Hezbollah in the 2006 Lebanon campaign; the Jaish al Mahdi (JAM) in Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2008; Mohammed Farah Aideed’s Habr Gedir militia in Somalia from 1992 to 1994; the Croatian nationalist ZNG and Croatian Serb SVK in the Croatian Wars of Independence of 1991&ndash;95; and the Vietcong in the American phase of the Second Indochina War from 1965 to 1968. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8099">The results are summarized in </span><a href="#calibre_link-278" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8100">table 10.1</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8101">.</span><sup class="calibre9"><a role="doc-noteref" id="calibre_link-1940" href="#calibre_link-2079" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8102">2</span></a></sup></p>
